- Peter McCullough SLAMS Pfizer board member over censorship and propaganda | Redacted NewsStudy explores effects of dietary choline deficiency on neurologic and system-wide healthArizona State University, January 16, 2023Choline, an essential nutrient produced in small amounts in the liver and found in foods including eggs, broccoli, beans, meat and poultry, is a vital ingredient for human health. 

- A new study explores how a deficiency of dietary choline adversely affects the body and may be a missing piece in the puzzle of Alzheimer’s disease. 

- Lack of adequate choline is also linked with profound changes in the brain associated with Alzheimer’s disease. 

- The new research, led by scientists at Arizona State University and published in Aging Cell, describes pathologies in normal mice deprived of dietary choline and in choline-deficient transgenic mice, the latter of which already exhibit symptoms associated with the disease. 

- In both cases, dietary choline deficiency results in liver damage, enlargement of the heart and neurologic alterations in the AD mice, typically accompanying Alzheimer’s disease and including increased levels of plaque-forming amyloid-beta protein and disease-linked alterations in tau protein. 

- In the case of humans, “it’s a twofold problem,” according to Ramon Velazquez, senior author of the study and assistant professor with the ASU-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center. 

- Moreover, inexpensive, over-the-counter choline supplements are encouraged to promote overall health and guard the brain from the effects of neurodegeneration. 

- Translating these findings to humans, this implies that people who are predisposed to Alzheimer’s disease or in the throes of the illness should ensure they are getting enough choline.”Our work provides further support that dietary choline should be consumed on a daily basis given the need throughout the body,” Velazquez says. 

- (NEXT)New research furthers case for exercise promoting youthfulnessUniversity of Arkansas, January 17, 2023A recent paper published in the Journal of Physiology deepened the case for the youthfulness-promoting effects of exercise on aging organisms, building on previous work done with lab mice nearing the end of their natural lifespan that had access to a weighted exercise wheel. 

- For this paper, the researchers compared aging mice that had access to a weighted exercise wheel with mice that had undergone epigenetic reprogramming via the expression of Yamanaka factors. 

- Myc may serve as a naturally induced reprogramming stimulus in muscle, making it a useful point of comparison between cells that have been reprogrammed via over expression of the Yamanaka factors and cells that have been reprogrammed through exercise—”reprogramming” in the latter case reflecting how an environmental stimulus can alter the accessibility and expression of genes. 

- Ultimately, the team determined that exercise promotes a molecular profile consistent with epigenetic partial programming. 

- That is to say, exercise can mimic aspects of the molecular profile of muscles that have been exposed to Yamanaka factors (thus displaying molecular characteristics of more youthful cells). 

- This beneficial effect of exercise may in part be attributed to the specific actions of Myc in muscle. 

- Murach sees their research as further validation of exercise as a polypill. 

- “Exercise is the most powerful drug we have,” he says, and should be considered a health-enhancing—and potentially life-extending—treatment along with medications and a healthy diet. 

- (NEXT)Deep meditation may alter gut microbes for better healthShanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (China), January 16, 2023Regular deep meditation, practiced for several years, may help to regulate the gut microbiome and potentially lower the risks of physical and mental ill health, finds a small comparative study published in the open access journal General Psychiatry. 

- The gut microbes found in a group of Tibetan Buddhist monks differed substantially from those of their secular neighbors, and have been linked to a lower risk of anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular disease. 

- Sample analysis revealed significant differences in the diversity and volume of microbes between the monks and their neighbors.”Collectively, several bacteria enriched in the meditation group [have been] associated with the alleviation of mental illness, suggesting that meditation can influence certain bacteria that may have a role in mental health,” write the researchers. 

- Finally, blood sample analysis showed that levels of agents associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease, including total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, were significantly lower in the monks than in their secular neighbors by their functional analysis with the gut microbes. 

- (NEXT)Curcumin/Boswellia shows promise in chronic kidney diseaseBaylor University, January 14, 2023.The Journal of Complementary and Integrative Medicine reports the finding of researchers at Baylor University of a reduction in a marker of inflammation among chronic kidney disease patients given a combination of Curcuma longa (curcumin) and Boswellia serrata. 

- The study included sixteen individuals receiving standard care for chronic kidney disease who were not undergoing dialysis. 

- Blood samples collected before and after treatment were analyzed for plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (markers of inflammation), and the endogenous antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, as well as serum C-reactive protein (CRP, another marker of inflammation.) 

- This meets the CDC definition of a safety signal.There are 96 safety signals for 12-17 year-olds, which include: myocarditis, pericarditis, Bell’s Palsy, genital ulcerations, high blood pressure and heartrate, menstrual irregularities, cardiac valve incompetencies, pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrhythmias, thromboses, pericardial and pleural effusion, appendicitis and perforated appendix, immune thrombocytopenia, chest pain, increased troponin levels, being in intensive care, and having anticoagulant therapy.There are 66 safety signals for 5-11 year-olds, which include: myocarditis, pericarditis, ventricular dysfunction and cardiac valve incompetencies, pericardial and pleural effusion, chest pain, appendicitis & appendectomies, Kawasaki’s disease, menstrual irregularities, vitiligo, and vaccine breakthrough infection.The safety signals cannot be dismissed as due to “stimulated,” exaggerated, fraudulent or otherwise artificially inflated reporting, nor can they be dismissed due to the huge number of COVID vaccines administered. 

- The CDC admitted to only having started its safety signal analysis on March 25, 2022 (coincidentally 3 days after a lawyer at Children’s Health Defense wrote to them reminding them about our FOIA request for it).

- Experienced dermatologists at the University of Eastern Finland carefully analysed the patients’ background information and medical history and examined their skin. 

- The study analyzed data from 25,206 men and 26,944 women who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2018. 

- However, without any prevention measures to delay cognitive function decline, the decline in cognitive function will gradually develop into mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease. 

- The process of Alzheimer’s disease is irreversible, and medical treatment for this disease is still limited. 

- The study found that eating fast food is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a potentially life-threatening condition in which fat builds up in the liver. 

- “Healthy livers contain a small amount of fat, usually less than 5%, and even a moderate increase in fat can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,” said Ani Kardashian, MD, a hepatologist with Keck Medicine and lead author of the study. 

- “However, if that one meal equals at least one-fifth of their daily calories, they are putting their livers at risk.” Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, also known as liver steatosis, can lead to cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver, which can cause liver cancer or failure.

- A randomized controlled trial in Frontiers in Nutrition showed that female and male participants who ate 57g almonds daily for one month had more of the beneficial fat 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-DiHOME) in their blood immediately after a session of intense exercise than control participants. 

- This molecule, a so-called oxylipin (oxidized fat) is synthetized from linoleic acid by brown fat tissue, and has a beneficial effect on metabolic health and energy regulation.Corresponding author Dr. David C Nieman, a professor and director of the Appalachian State University Human Performance Laboratory at the North Carolina Research Campus, said, “Here we show that volunteers who consumed 57g of almonds daily for one month before a single ‘weekend warrior’ exercise bout had more beneficial 12,13-DiHOME in their blood immediately after exercising than control volunteers. 

- They also reported feeling less fatigue and tension, better leg-back strength, and decreased muscle damage after exercise than control volunteers.”The clinical trial involved 38 men and 26 women between the ages of 30 and 65, who didn’t engage in regular weight training. 

- Additional blood and urine samples were taken immediately after this 90 minute session of ‘eccentric exercise’ and daily for four days afterwards.As expected, the 90 minute exercise led to an increase in the volunteers’ self-reported feeling of muscle damage and muscle soreness, as well as an increased POMS score, indicating self-reported decreased vigor and increased fatigue, anxiety, and depression.The exercise also resulted in transient elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and MCP-1 in the blood, consistent with minor muscle damage. 

- However, these changes in cytokines were equal in the almond and cereal bar groups.Importantly, immediately after exercise, the concentration of the beneficial 12,13-DiHOME was 69% higher in blood plasma of participants in the almond group than in participants in the control group. 

- 12,13-DiHOME is known to increase the transport of fatty acid and its uptake by skeletal muscle, with the overall effect of stimulating metabolic recovery after exercise.The reverse pattern was found for another oxylipin, the mildly toxic 9,10-Dihydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (9,10-diHOME), which was 40% higher immediately after exercise in the blood of the control group than in the almond group. 

- Unlike 12,13-DiHOME, 9,10-diHOME has been shown have negative effects on overall health and the body’s recovery to exercise.Nieman and colleagues concluded that daily consumption of almonds leads to a change in metabolism, downregulating inflammation and oxidative stress from exercise and enabling the body to recover faster.“We conclude that almonds provide a unique and complex nutrient and polyphenol mixture that may support metabolic recovery from stressful levels of exercise. 

- They also saw their levels of stress and anxiety significantly decrease.The findings were published in The Lancet Planetary Health.“These findings provide concrete evidence that community gardening could play an important role in preventing cancer, chronic diseases and mental health disorders,” said senior author Jill Litt, a professor in the Department of Environmental Studies at CU Boulder.“No matter where you go, people say there’s just something about gardening that makes them feel better,” said Litt, who is also a researcher with the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.Some small observational studies have found that people who garden tend to eat more fruits and vegetables and have a healthier weight. 

- But it has been unclear whether healthier people just tend to garden, or gardening influences health.Only three studies have applied the gold standard of scientific research, the randomized controlled trial, to the pastime. 

- More than a third were Hispanic and more than half came from low-income households.The gardening group received a free community garden plot, some seeds and seedlings, and an introductory gardening course through the nonprofit Denver Urban Gardens program and a study partner.By fall, those in the gardening group were eating, on average, 1.4 grams more fiber per day than the control group—an increase of about 7%.The authors note that fiber exerts a profound effect on inflammatory and immune responses, influencing everything from how we metabolize food to how healthy our gut microbiome is to how susceptible we are to diabetes and certain cancers.While doctors recommend about 25 to 38 grams of fiber per day, the average adult consumes less than 16 grams.“An increase of one gram of fiber can have large, positive effects on health,” said co-author James Hebert, director of University of South Carolina’s cancer prevention and control program.The gardening group also increased their physical activity levels by about 42 minutes per week. 

- Public health agencies recommend at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week, a recommendation only a quarter of the U.S. population meets. 

- With just two to three visits to the community garden weekly, participants met 28% of that requirement.Study participants also saw their stress and anxiety levels decrease, with those who came into the study most stressed and anxious seeing the greatest reduction in mental health issues.The study also confirmed that even novice gardeners can reap measurable health benefits of the pastime in their first season. 

- As they have more experience and enjoy greater yields, Litt suspects such benefits will increase.Researchers shed light on how exercise preserves physical fitness during agingJoslin Diabetes Center, December 6, 2023Proven to protect against a wide array of diseases, exercise may be the most powerful anti-aging intervention known to science. 

- However, while physical activity can improve health during aging, its beneficial effects inevitably decline. 

- The cellular mechanisms underlying the relationship among exercise, fitness and aging remain poorly understood.In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at Joslin Diabetes Center investigated the role of one cellular mechanism in improving physical fitness by exercise training and identified one anti-aging intervention that delayed the declines that occur with aging in the model organism. 

- Together, the scientists’ findings open the door to new strategies for promoting muscle function during aging.“Our data identify an essential mediator of exercise responsiveness and an entry point for interventions to maintain muscle function during aging.”That essential mediator is the cycle of fragmentation and repair of the mitochondria, the specialized structures, or organelles, inside every cell responsible for producing energy. 

- Mitochondrial function is critical to health, and disruption of mitochondrial dynamics  the cycle of repairing dysfunctional mitochondria and restoring the connectivity among the energy-producing organelles — has been linked to the development and progression of chronic, age-related diseases, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.“As we perceive that our muscles undergo a pattern of fatigue and restoration after an exercise session, they are undergoing this mitochondrial dynamic cycle,” said Blackwell, who is also acting section head of Immunobiology at Joslin. 

- “In this process, muscles manage the aftermath of the metabolic demand of exercise and restore their functional capability.”“We determined that a single exercise session induces a cycle of fatigue and physical fitness recovery that is paralleled by a cycle of the mitochondrial network rebuilding,” said first author Juliane Cruz Campos, a postdoctoral fellow at Joslin Diabetes Center. 

- That suggested that mitochondrial dynamics might be important for maintaining physical fitness and possibly for physical fitness to be enhanced by a bout of exercise.”Finally, the researchers tested known, lifespan-extending interventions for their ability to improve exercise capacity during aging. 

- Worms with increased AMPK — a molecule that is a key regulator of energy during exercise which also promotes remodeling of mitochondrial morphology and metabolism — exhibited improved physical fitness. 

- They also demonstrated maintenance of, but not enhancement of, exercise performance during aging. 

- They also did not receive the age-delaying benefits of exercise over the course of the lifespan.Nighttime electronic device use lowers melatonin levelsBrigham and Women’s Hospital, December 24 2022.The Proceedings of the National Academy of Science published the findings researchers at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital of a suppressive effect for evening use of light-emitting electronic devices on sleep and melatonin secretion.“Electronic devices emit light that is short-wavelength-enriched light, which has a higher concentration of blue light — with a peak around 450 nm — than natural light,” explained lead author Anne-Marie Chang. 

- “It is important to further study the effects of using light-emitting devices, especially before bed, as they may have longer term health consequences than we previously considered.”Iron deficiency anemia associated with hearing lossPenn State University, December 29, 2022In a study published online by JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Kathleen M. Schieffer, B.S., of the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pa., and colleagues examined the association between sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss and iron deficiency anemia in adults ages 21 to 90 years in the United States.Approximately 15 percent of adults report difficulty with hearing. 

- Because iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common and easily correctable condition, further understanding of the association between IDA and all types of hearing loss may help to open new possibilities for early identification and appropriate treatment. 

- For this study, using data obtained from deidentified electronic medical records from the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, Pa., iron deficiency anemia was determined by low hemoglobin and ferritin levels for age and sex in 305,339 adults ages 21 to 90 years; associations between hearing loss and IDA were evaluated.Of the patients in the study population, 43 percent were men; average age was 50 years. 

- The next steps are to better understand this correlation and whether promptly diagnosing and treating IDA may positively affect the overall health status of adults with hearing loss,” the authors write.

- "We wanted to investigate whether diet and nutrition predict cognitive performance in healthy older adults," said University of Illinois postdoctoral researcher Christopher Zwilling, who led the study with U. of I. psychology professor Aron Barbey in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. 

- The analysis linked specific patterns of a handful of nutrient biomarkers in the blood to better brain health and cognition. 

- The nutrient patterns included omega-3 fatty acids, which are abundant in fish, walnuts and Brussels sprouts; omega-6 fatty acids, found in flaxseed, pumpkin seeds, pine nuts and pistachios; lycopene, a vivid red pigment in tomatoes, watermelon and a few other fruits and vegetables; alpha- and beta-carotenoids, which give sweet potatoes and carrots their characteristic orange color; and vitamins B and D. The researchers relied on some of the most rigorous methods available for examining nutrient intake and brain health, Barbey said. 

- "Our study suggests that diet and nutrition moderate the association between network efficiency and cognitive performance," Barbey said. 

- "(NEXT)Sunlight offers surprise benefit -- it energizes infection fighting T cellsGeorgetown University Medical Center, December 20, 2022Sunlight allows us to make vitamin D, credited with healthier living, but a surprise research finding could reveal another powerful benefit of getting some sun. 

- Georgetown University Medical Center researchers have found that sunlight, through a mechanism separate than vitamin D production, energizes T cells that play a central role in human immunity. 

- Chemotherapy is currently the only available treatment for this type of cancer. 

- Moreover, the treatment caused tumour cells to die in larger numbers. 

- (NEXT)Losing body fat could be facilitated by light evening exercise and fastingBaylor College of Medicine, December 20, 2022Making muscles burn more fat and less glucose can increase exercise endurance, but could simultaneously cause diabetes, says a team of scientists from Baylor College of Medicine and other institutions.Mouse muscles use glucose (carbohydrate) as fuel when the animals are awake and active and switch to fat (lipid) when they are asleep. 

- The team discovered that disrupting this natural cycle may lead to diabetes but, surprisingly, can also enhance exercise endurance. 

- This finding opens the possibility of selecting the right time to exercise for losing body fat but also raises the concern of using HDAC inhibitors as doping drugs for endurance exercise. 

- The study opens the possibility of promoting body fat burning by increasing exercise activity during the periods in which muscles use lipid, which is at night for people. 

- (NEXT)New Cannabis Capsule Is So Powerful It’s Going To Completely Replace All Pain KillersUniversity of Pennsylvania, December 19, 2022In places where medical marijuana is legal, opioid abuse and addiction has fallen by 25%, but the government maintain they are stumped as to why Opioid abuse and addiction is a massive problem all over the US, hence why people are eager to find natural alternatives. 

- The health benefits of cannabis are become more and more accepted in mainstream society, as more studies which support cannaboid use are published. 

- In the U.S. states where medical marijuana is legal to use, deaths from opioid overdoses have decreased by almost 25 percent, according to a new data. 

- The study was done by Bachhuber, of the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of Pennsylvania, and his colleagues who used state-level death certificate data for all 50 states. 

- According to JAMA Medicine, in states with a medical marijuana law, overdose deaths from opioids like morphine, oxycodone and heroin decreased by an average of 20 percent after just one year. 

- Eva Bartlett (6:58)Mediterranean diet linked to lower preeclampsia riskCedars-Sinai Medical Center, December 22, 2022In a new study evaluating the Mediterranean diet and adverse pregnancy outcomes, investigators from the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai found that women who conceived while adhering to the anti-inflammatory diet had a significantly lower risk of developing preeclampsia during pregnancy. 

- The research is the first to monitor the effects of dietary change on digestive health and immune function in a parent and child and whether this positively affects immunity, inflammation and general health. 

- Writing in Nutrition Research, researchers began by enrolling 29 healthy parent and child pairs in to a 14-week, randomised, controlled, crossover study. 

- In another study, 313 participants read one of two health information passages about colorectal cancer. 

- One passage contained metaphors relating cancer to an enemy (“This disease involves an enemy uprising of abnormal cellular growth in the large intestine.”), whereas the second passage contained no enemy metaphors. 

- Participants then rated the extent to which they intended to engage in various prevention, screening and treatment behaviors. 

- “Importantly, these negative effects of enemy metaphors on prevention behaviors are not accompanied by a positive effect on intentions to undertake screening or treatment behaviors.” War and enemy metaphors are the most common metaphors found in science journalism about cancer, and they pervade public discourse about the disease.”Fight and battle are actually among the top 10 verbs used to describe cancer,” Hauser said. 

- “Constant exposure to even minor metaphorical utterances may be enough to make enemy metaphors for cancer a powerful influence on public health–with unfortunate side-effects.”(NEXT)More proof that cannabis is an anti-aging powerhouse to rapidly restore memory performance of older miceHebrew University Jerusalem & University of Bonn (Germany), December 14, 2022Scientists from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Bonn teamed up to examine the potential brain benefits of cannabis in mice. 

- “The treatment completely reversed the loss of performance in the old animals,” reported Prof. Andreas Zimmer from the Institute of Molecular Psychiatry at the University of Bonn and member of the Cluster of Excellence ImmunoSensation. 

- “It looked as though the THC treatment turned back the molecular clock,” Zimmer commented. 

- (NEXT)Brussels Sprouts Have As Much Vitamin C As Oranges – And Plenty Of Other Health BenefitsQuadram Institute, December 22, 2022For many people, Christmas dinner is not complete without a side helping of Brussels sprouts. 

- But if you’re not a convert, perhaps these health benefits will convince you to give them a second chance. 

- They are rich in vitamins K and C, supporting a healthy immune system and bones. 

- Cooked Brussels sprouts still contain vitamin C, though – about the same pound for pound as you’d get from orange juice and raw oranges.Most importantly, Brussels sprouts are rich in a wide range of natural chemicals, such as carotenoids and polyphenols, that have been linked to good health. 

- Several scientific studies have shown that these sulphurous compounds are potent antioxidants that can promote health by preventing cell damage. 

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans conducted at recruitment determined the presence of cerebrovascular disease and/or brain atrophy and blood samples were evaluated for plasma ergothioneine. 

- The findings suggest that nurses and other health professionals in oncology settings should be provided with acupressure training to help patients who are experiencing sleep problems.“Based on available evidence, acupressure may be a more promising approach than acupuncture for reducing sleep disturbance in patients with cancer,” said corresponding author Denise Shuk Ting Cheung, BNurs, PhD, RN, of the University of Hong Kong. 

- “Future studies should focus on the differential mechanisms of action of acupressure and acupuncture and link them to the multifactorial causes of sleep disturbance in patients with cancer.”(NEXT)Extraversion, conscientiousness linked to immune system functionUniversity of Nottingham, December 15, 2022Researchers have long suggested that personality may influence health. 

- In addition, the researchers took note of participants’ exercise, smoking and drinking behaviors so they could rule these out as contributing factors. 

- The team notes that their findings remained, even after accounting for participants’ smoking, drinking and exercise status, as well as any reported negative emotions. 

- In addition, Medical News Today reported on a study suggesting that men who are narcissistic – defined as having an inflated view of self-importance – may be more likely to develop cardiovascular problems than those who do not have narcissistic traits. 

- Other areas included being able to reflect on past successes; being in control of when they need help from family; being outwardly presentable; and normalizing the impact of ill health. 

- “We found that participants in the study saw themselves as content with their lives, despite their world becoming smaller, and in poor health and other challenges, they were able to find pleasure in the smaller things of their daily routines and events.” “Being independent came through strongly as a way of explaining their continued passion for life, and was strongly equated to feelings of dignity and youth. 

- A bit of risk-taking, particularly with their health, was also important in order to keep their autonomy, particularly with family, where children had now become the caregiver.” Family relationships, however, were the most complex issue and those that felt most content were those that had made decisions about their own care—when to ask for help and when to ignore advice from their children or grandchildren. 

- Participants also reported that even in serious ill health, accepting it as “normal” helped in minimizing its impact on their lives. 

- Their findings are based on data from 13 healthy adults (six women, seven men) aged 22-71 years (average age 34) with no history of heart or lung disease, and no known gait disorder. 

- Oxygen uptake (mL/kg/min), energy expenditure (kcal/kg/min) and exercise intensity (METs)—the amount of calories expended per minute of physical activity—were also measured. 

- However, the Teabag walk elicited an oxygen uptake of 27.9 mL/kg/min, or 8 METs, which qualifies as vigorous intensity exercise. 

- (NEXT)Wolfberry consumption may offer flu protection: Mouse dataTufts University, December 17, 2022Consumption of wolfberries – also known as goji berries – may be associated with increasing the protective effect of influenza vaccines against the virus, according to new research in mice.Writing in the Journal of Nutrition, the study analysed the effect of goji berry consumption on the effectiveness of the influenze vaccine to prevent infection with the influenza virus in older mice. 

- Led by researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (USDA HNRCA) at Tufts University, the research team noted that current vaccines for influenza do not fully protect the elderly against infection, and although wolfberry has been shown to improve immune responses “it is not known if this effect would translate to better protection.”The findings of the new study suggest that wolfberries appear to interact with the influenza vaccine, and therefore offer additional protection against the flu virus, by increasing the activity of dendritic cells – which play an important role in the ability of the immune system to defend against viral infections. 

- “While previous studies have shown that wolfberries bolster immune response in mice, our results introduce their potential to reduce the age-related risk and severity of the flu virus in the presence of the vaccine.” “Wolfberries are rich in complex carbohydrates known as polysaccharides, as well as vitamins, carotenoids and flavonoids,” he commented. 

- The researchers looked at data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the US. 

- This is a nationally representative annual survey of around 10, 000 people that includes interviews, physical examinations, and blood samples, designed to gauge the health and nutritional status of US adults and children. 

- But tea contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective chemicals, which have been associated with a lowered risk of serious conditions, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, say the researchers. 

- (NEXT)Effects of Resveratrol on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Trial.Poznan University of Medical Sciences (Poland), November 29, 2022Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting women of reproductive age. 

- Primary outcome was the change in the serum total T. Resveratrol treatment led to a significant decrease of total T by 23.1% . 

- (NEXT)Encouraging risk-taking in children may reduce the prevalence of childhood anxietyMacquarie University’s Centre for Emotional Health (Netherlands), December 13, 2022A new international study suggests that parents who employ challenging parent behavioural (CPB) methods – active physical and verbal behaviours that encourage children to push their limits – are likely protecting their children from developing childhood anxiety disorders. 

- Researchers from Macquarie University’s Centre for Emotional Health, along with partners from the University of Amsterdam and the University of Reading, surveyed 312 families with preschool-aged children across the Netherlands and Australia. 

- (NEXT)Music therapy reduces pain and anxiety for patients with cancer and sickle cell diseaseUniversity Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, December 19, 2022A new study found patients with cancer and patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) treated at an academic cancer center reported clinically significant reductions in pain and anxiety in response to music therapy. 

- In this retrospective study conducted between January 2017 and July 202, music therapists at UH Connor Whole Health provided 4,002 music therapy sessions to 1,152 patients across 2,400 encounters at UH Seidman Cancer Center, making this the largest investigation of the real-world effectiveness of music therapy within hematology and oncology to date. 

- This study builds upon a history of seminal music therapy studies funded by the Kulas Foundation, the country’s leading foundation for funding scientific research in music therapy, that have investigated the efficacy of music therapy in palliative care, surgery, and sickle cell disease at UH. 

- As part of clinical care, the music therapists assessed patients’ self-reported pain, anxiety, and fatigue on a 0 to 10 scale at the beginning and end of each session and documented their sessions in the electronic health record.“This research highlights the increased symptom burden that adults with SCD face in the hospital and the significant impact that a single session of music therapy can have on their pain and anxiety.” These studies support the benefits of music therapy for managing acute pain, improving self-efficacy and quality of life, and improving sickle cell disease knowledge in adolescents and young adults transitioning from pediatric to adult care. 

- Using an evidence-based approach and building off research allows us to confidently build a program around supporting patients with integrative modalities as part of a strategy to manage symptoms that they may encounter through therapies or from cancer,” explained Santosh Rao, MD, a board-certified medical oncologist and integrative medicine provider and Medical Director of Integrative Oncology at UH Connor Whole Health. 

- (NEXT)Study links health risks to electromagnetic field exposureKaiser Permanente Division of Research, December 16, 2022A study of real-world exposure to non-ionizing radiation from magnetic fields in pregnant women found a significantly higher rate of miscarriage, providing new evidence regarding their potential health risks. 

- While the health hazards from ionizing radiation are well-established and include radiation sickness, cancer and genetic damage, the evidence of health risks to humans from non-ionizing radiation remains limited, said De-Kun Li, MD, PhD, principal investigator of the study and a reproductive and perinatal epidemiologist at the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research in Oakland, California. 

- In a new study funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, researchers asked women over age 18 with confirmed pregnancies to wear a small (a bit larger than a deck of cards) magnetic-field monitoring device for 24 hours. 

- “This study provides evidence from a human population that magnetic field non-ionizing radiation could have adverse biological impacts on human health,” he said. 

- (NEXT)Common food dye can trigger inflammatory bowel diseases, say researchersMcMaster University (Ontario), December 20 2022Long-term consumption of Allura Red food dye can be a potential trigger of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, says McMaster University’s Waliul Khan. 

- Researchers using experimental animal models of IBD found that continual exposure to Allura Red AC harms gut health and promotes inflammation. 

- The use of synthetic food dyes such as Allura Red has increased significantly over the last several decades, but there has been little earlier study of these dyes’ effects on gut health. 

- “This study demonstrates significant harmful effects of Allura Red on gut health and identifies gut serotonin as a critical factor mediating these effects. 

- These findings have important implication in the prevention and management of gut inflammation,” said Khan, the study’s senior author, a professor of the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine and a principal investigator of Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute.”What we have found is striking and alarming, as this common synthetic food dye is a possible dietary trigger for IBDs. 

- “The literature suggests that the consumption of Allura Red also affects certain allergies, immune disorders and behavioral problems in children, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.”

- Therefore, in this model, cancer stem cells that are not killed by treatments lead to the formation of more invasive and treatment-resistant tumors. 

- Otherwise, these cancer stem cells will pave the way for the formation of more invasive and treatment-resistant tumors. 

- (NEXT)Chiropractic spinal manipulation associated with reduction in low back surgeryUniversity Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, December 19, 2022A recent study from University Hospitals (UH) Connor Whole Health has found that adults who initially visit a chiropractor to receive spinal manipulation for low back pain caused by disc herniation or radiculopathy (i.e., sciatica) are less likely to undergo discectomy (i.e., disc surgery) over the subsequent two years. 

- In this retrospective cohort study, the authors selected adult patients, age 18 to 49, from a 101 million patient United States health records network (TriNetX, Cambridge, MA, U.S.). 

- Ultimately, the authors identified 5,785 patients who initially received chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy, and the same number of patients who received other forms of medical care for their low back pain. 

- (NEXT)High-intensity exercise delays Parkinson’s progressionNorthwestern Medicine and University of Denver, December 11, 2022High-intensity exercise three times a week is safe for individuals with early-stage Parkinson’s disease and decreases worsening of motor symptoms, according to a new phase 2, multi-site trial led by Northwestern Medicine and University of Denver scientists. 

- This is the first time scientists have tested the effects of high-intensity exercise on patients with Parkinson’s disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the most common movement disorder, affecting more than a million people in the United States. 

- It previously had been thought high-intensity exercise was too physically stressful for individuals with Parkinson’s disease.“If you have Parkinson’s disease and you want to delay the progression of your symptoms, you should exercise three times a week with your heart rate between 80 to 85 percent maximum.Because medications for Parkinson’s have adverse side effects and reduced effectiveness over time, new treatments are needed.The randomized clinical trial included 128 participants ages 40 to 80 years old from Northwestern University, Rush University Medical Center, the University of Colorado and the University of Pittsburgh. 

- Participants enrolled in the Study in Parkinson Disease of Exercise (SPARX) were at an early stage of the disease and not taking Parkinson’s medication, ensuring the results of the study were related to the exercise and not affected by medication.“The earlier in the disease you intervene, the more likely it is you can prevent the progression of the disease,” Corcos said. 

- “We delayed worsening of symptoms for six months; whether we can prevent progression any longer than six months will require further study.” Scientists examined the safety and effects of exercise three times weekly for six months at high intensity, 80 to 85 percent of maximum heart rate, and moderate intensity, 60 to 65 percent of maximum heart rate. 

- They compared the results to a control group who did not exercise. 

- After six months, participants were rated by clinicians on a Parkinson’s disease scale ranging from 0 to 108. 

- Participants in the study had a score of about 20 before exercise. 

- The group with moderate exercise got worse by 1.5 points. 

- The group that did not exercise worsened by three points. 

- Three points out of a score of 20 points is a 15 percent change in the primary signs of the disease and considered clinically important to patients. 

- The recommendation comes at a time when there is increasing evidence to suggest that red meat is linked with a higher rate of gestational diabetes in pregnant women, which poses risks to the health of both the mother and the baby. 

- (NEXT)Treatment for lupus may depend on restoring proteins in patients’ bloodSingapore General Hospital, December 19, 2022Restoring protein balance in the blood may be key to developing an effective treatment for lupus. 

- The incurable autoimmune disease reportedly affects about 100 in every 100,000 people worldwide, and disproportionally affects women between 15 and 45 years-old and Asians. 

- The aggressive nature of the disease is what makes it life-threatening for many who have it, especially since current treatments don’t help that much. 

- “We are excited about the possibility of a new treatment option for lupus as 30 to 60 percent of patients do not respond to conventional medications despite aggressive regimens. 

- They revealed that lupus patients had considerably lower levels of the protein in their blood compared to healthy people, thus suggesting that it may have a connection to the disease. 

- The entire team is hopeful that they can continue to build on their research to better the lives of patient’s suffering from this debilitating disease. 

- “To be in the forefront of medicine means we have to constantly further our understanding of diseases and offer patients better treatment options through rigorous scientific research. 

- I’m heartened that the team has shed new light on lupus and the possibility of a more efficacious therapy for patients some years down the road,” says Professor Fong Kok Yong, Deputy Group CEO (Medical and Clinical Services), SingHealth, and Senior Consultant, Department Rheumatology & Immunology, SGH
Menopausal women should eat more blackcurrant to prevent bone lossUniversity of Connecticut, December 11, 2022Hormonal changes are one of the leading causes of bone loss or osteoporosis. 

- However, the treatment of blackcurrant reduced ovariectomy-induced bone loss. 

- In addition, the treatment decreased osteoclast-like cell formation and bone resorption activity. 

- "Vitamin B12 deficiency is relatively common," say the researchers, "especially among older adults; it has potentially serious medical complications if undiagnosed." 

- (NEXT)Microbiome: Scientists highlight role of harmful gut bacteria in fever afflicting cancer patientsUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, December 16, 2022An altered gut microbiome is an unexpected cause of fever afflicting many patients undergoing chemotherapy, according to scientists who've also discovered that poor appetite during cancer treatment may trigger the biological forces that can likewise adversely raise body temperature. 

- For patients undergoing treatment for leukemia, it's a common side effect, according to the American Cancer Society. 

- (NEXT)Healthy diet may mean longer life for kidney patientsUniversity of Bari (Italy), December 9, 2022A healthy diet may help people with kidney disease live longer, researchers report.They analyzed seven studies that included more than 15,000 people with chronic kidney disease, to assess the effects of a diet high in fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, whole grains and fiber. 

- Elevated levels of phenylacetylglutamine (PAG)—a byproduct created when microbes in the gut breakdown dietary protein—can be directly linked to both increased heart failure risk and severity, according to findings published in Circulation: Heart Failure.The new findings improve researchers' understanding of how the gut microbiome, through PAG levels, are linked to cardiac disease risks, and suggest potential approaches to modify PAG-associated risks through interventions such as diet and beta blocker use. 

- (NEXT)Study: Running actually lowers inflammation in knee jointsRunning may also slow the process that leads to osteoarthritisBrigham Young University, December 12, 2022We all know that running causes a bit of inflammation and soreness, and that's just the price you pay for cardiovascular health. 

- New research from BYU exercise science professors finds that pro-inflammatory molecules actually go down in the knee joint after running. 

- Hyldahl said the study results indicate running is chondroprotective, which means exercise may help delay the onset of joint degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis. 

- This is potentially great news, since osteoarthritis--the painful disease where cartilage at the end of bones wears down and gradually worsens over time--affects about 27 million people in the United States.

- – The Religion of TotalitarianisSupplemental, dietary antioxidant intake linked with lower dementia riskLishui University (China), December 12 2022.Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal European Geriatric Medicine revealed a relationship between increased intake of antioxidant vitamins C and E and a lower risk of dementia.Futao Zhou and colleagues identified 75 studies from 19 articles that included a total of 28,257 participants for their review. 

- The studies evaluated the association between intake from diet and/or supplements of beta-carotene, flavonoids, vitamin C and vitamin E with Alzheimer disease, all-cause dementia and cognitive impairment without dementia. 

- The research included 2,557 participants with Alzheimer disease, 1,035 cases categorized as all-cause dementia and 6,197 cases of cognitive impairment without dementia. 

- When high intake of vitamins C or E was compared to low intake, high dietary plus supplemental intake of either vitamin was associated with a “markedly” lower risk of Alzheimer disease. 

- High vitamin C from diet plus supplementation was associated with 30% lower risk and high vitamin E with a 27% lower risk of the disease in comparison with low intake. 

- Each 20 milligram per day increase in vitamin C from diet, diet plus supplements, or overall, was associated with a 2% reduction in the risk of Alzheimer disease. 

- The results suggest that tables on the antioxidant capacities of food products that dieticians and health authorities use must be revised. 

- (NEXT)‘Obesity can reduce life by up to 8 years’McGill University (Montreal), December 8, 2022Life expectancy can be reduced by up to 8 years by obesity, which can also cause adults to lose as much as 19 years of healthy life if it leads to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 

- The researchers behind the study analyzed data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), creating a disease-simulation model to estimate the risk of adults of different body weight developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 

- As well as reducing life expectancy, carrying extra weight was also found to reduce “healthy life-years,” which were defined in the study as years free of obesity-linked cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 

- These new findings highlight the benefits of reducing time spent in sedentary behaviors, for both the general population and those living with chronic disease. 

- The average age was 55 and most participants had ended treatment two years prior. 

- Conventional lifestyle changes consisted of moderate aerobic exercise, diet, and smoking cessation. 

- Dr Angrish said: “Although the reduction in blood pressure was modest, it could be clinically very meaningful because even a 2 mmHg decrease in diastolic BP has the potential to decrease the risk of coronary heart disease by 6% and the risk of stroke and transient ischaemic attack by 15%.”He concluded: “Our research suggests that patients with prehypertension should be advised to practice hatha yoga (a combination of asanas, pranayam and meditation) for one hour daily.

- “Our study highlights the importance of micronutrient diversity and the balance of health benefits and risks.” “Research on micronutrient supplementation has mainly focused on the health effects of a single or a few vitamins and minerals,” Liu said. 

- These included omega-3 fatty acid, which decreased mortality from cardiovascular disease; folic acid, which lowered stroke risk; and coenzyme Q10, an antioxidant sometimes marketed as CoQ10, which decreased all-cause mortality. 

- Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E and selenium showed no effect on long-term cardiovascular disease outcomes or type-2 diabetes risk, while beta carotene supplements increased all-cause mortality. 

- Further study is needed, including large, high-quality interventional trials to investigate the long-term effects of certain micronutrients on health. 

- Phytosanitary products, processing aids, food additives, and surfaces that touch food in storage can all transfer nanoparticles that might be consumed by humans.In a review published in Frontiers in Allergy, Mohammad Issa, at the Université Paris-Saclay, and colleagues pointed out that such a significant change to food production could have unforeseen health consequences. 

- “This may be linked to the epidemic of immune-related disorders in children, such as food allergies—a major public health concern.” We know that environmental factors play a significant role in allergy development, and the higher prevalence in children suggests that early life environmental factors are likely key. 

- Dietary practices and the environment affect gut health in young children, and the deprivation of gut microbiota and a wide range of dietary proteins can affect the development of oral tolerance. 

- “Our review highlights the urgent need for researchers to assess the risk related to exposure to foodborne inorganic nanoparticles during a critical window of susceptibility and its impact on children health.”(NEXT)Pregnant moms’ stress may accelerate cell aging of white, not Black, kidsUniversity of California, San Francisco, December 4, 2022Does stress during pregnancy impact children’s cell aging, and does race matter? 

- UCSF researchers followed 110 white and 112 Black women from age 10 to about 40 as well as their first child (average age 8) to understand stress influences on the women’s health and its effects on their children.What they found surprised them. 

- “Ours is the first study we know of that examined effects of stressor type and timing on this aspect of health for white and Black mothers and their children,” said lead study author Stefanie Mayer, Ph.D., UCSF assistant professor of psychiatry at the Weill Institute for Neurosciences. 

- Telomere length naturally shortens with age, and shorter telomeres predict earlier onset of illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes as well as earlier death.Previous studies showed that prenatal stressors are linked to shorter offspring telomeres, but those studies comprised mostly white mothers.

- These findings support current public health recommendations on limiting ultraprocessed food consumption because of their potential harm to cognitive function. 

- The research – published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded the lycopene-free extract “may be appropriate for use as a dietary antiplatelet.” Lead researcher Dr Niamh O’Kennedy working at the Rowett Institute of Nutrition & Health at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland told us the research showed tomato extracts could be used as alternatives to drugs like aspirin for blood thinning. 

- ” She added: “Results like this show that people and the medical world should start looking at dietary interventions like these that can have a big impact.” Platelet plugs usually form within 50-100 seconds. 

- Because of this more gentle effect, Dr Kennedy and her team suggested tomato extract could be a suitable dietary intervention to control platelet hyperactivity which increases with age, the onset of type II diabetes, mellitus, atherosclerosis and other conditions in subjects with low cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

- A lot of the medicine we use to treat our health conditions may actually cause more harm than good. 

- Inflammation impairs the immune system, plays a role in cachexia, lowers toleration of numerous cancer treatments, and generally decreases health and quality of life.This study made use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) treatments and analyzed their effects.The results found indicate great promise for the use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C treatments to help reduce inflammation in cancer patients, which is one of the major factors of cancer and its progression.Markers of inflammation such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein tumor markers showed a positive response to vitamin C treatments, with inflammation reduced significantly. 

- When supplementing with liposomal vitamin C orally for major health issues, 10,000 to 12,000 mg per day should be taken.

- Without adequate B12 in the body, overall health and quality of life are negatively affected. 

- However, since there can be so many causes for these symptoms, health care providers may overlook the possibility of a B12 deficiency and fail to screen for it. 

- Treatment for B12 deficiency can be oral, applied under the tongue or administered through the nose, or it may require various types of injections. 

- A B12 supplement or balanced multivitamin may be enough to correct the deficiency, as it was for Scout, but it’s best to work with a health care provider to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.The Conversation(NEXT)The real benefits of walking in a winter wonderlandMedical University of Silesia (Poland) & Anglia Ruskin University (UK), November 29, 2022Research has shown for the first time that spending time in snowy surroundings can improve how you feel about your body. 

- Previous studies have found that green spaces, such as parks and forests, and “blue environments,” such as being at the coast or close to a river, can improve body image.Now new research, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, has discovered that white spaces, in this case a snow-covered woodland, can have a similar effect. 

- Led by academics from the Medical University of Silesia, in Katowice, Poland, and Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) in the U.K., the research was carried out last winter and involved 87 women, with an average age of 24, who took part in small groups. 

- “Our findings demonstrate the importance of ensuring that everyone can access restorative natural environments, which may be a cost-effective way of promoting healthier body image, and highlight that there are significant benefits of being outside in nature, whatever the weather.”(NEXT)Diet can lower risk of cardiovascular disease by 10 percent, study showsBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, November 29, 2022In a new study, researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) compared the effects of three eating patterns on patients’ risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event within in the next ten years—the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and the Western diet that is typically low in fruits and vegetables while high in fat and sodium. 

- While a diet rich in fruits and vegetables produced reductions in risk for woman and Black participants, the effect with the DASH diet was twice as large in women and four times as large in Black adults.” To determine the effect of the different diets on an individual’s risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, Juraschek and colleagues acquired data from 459 adults aged 22 to 75 who participated in the original DASH trial between 1994 and 1996. 

- When Juraschek and colleagues compared the data, they found that both the DASH diet and the fruit and vegetable diet had lowered participants’ 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by about 10 percent overall. 

- It started…” – Peter Schiff’s Last WARNING (10:07)So THIS is how they plan to screw these companies, from inside out | Redacted with Clayton Morris (2:48)Higher vitamin C levels associated with lower mortality risk during 16-year periodChinese Academy of Medical Sciences, November 25, 2022A study reported in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health has uncovered an association between higher plasma vitamin C levels and a lower risk of mortality during more than 16 years of follow-up. 

- The study included 473 men and 475 women between the ages of 53 and 84 who were enrolled in the General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial (NIT) cohort in Linxian, China. 

- Those whose plasma vitamin C levels were among the highest 25% had an adjusted risk of dying from cancer or stroke that was 28% lower and a risk of dying from heart disease that was 35% lower than subjects whose levels were lowest. 

- When subjects with low vitamin C levels (defined as 28 micromoles per liter or below) and normal levels (greater than 28 micromoles per liter) were compared, a normal level was associated with a 23% lower risk of premature mortality and a 38% lower risk of dying from heart disease, in comparison with low levels. 

- As a possible reason for their findings, Shao-Ming Wang and colleagues note that oxidative stress is lowered by vitamin C. Oxidative stress can promote endothelial dysfunction that underlies heart disease by increasing inflammation and lipid peroxidation and decreasing nitric oxide availability. 

- “In this long-term prospective Chinese cohort study, higher plasma vitamin C concentration was associated with lower total mortality, heart disease mortality, and cancer mortality. 

- Our results corroborate the importance of adequate vitamin C to human health.”(next)Cauliflower Prevent Various Cancers: Thanks to Sulforaphane CompoundsRugters University, November 19, 2022Cauliflower contains glucosinolates and thiocyanates — both sulfur-containing phytonutrients that cleanse the body of damaging free radicals. 

- Writing in the journal Clinical Nutrition, the researchers noted that the protective benefits were greater for women who were underweight, with a 25 g/day increase in protein reducing their risk by 45%. 

- As an observational study, the researchers were able to identify associations between factors in diet and health. 

- However, intakes of protein which are very high—where intake is greater than 2 to 3 g of protein/kg body weight/day—can have negative health effects. 

- The study was not able to explore these very high protein intake levels.Professor Janet Cade, who leads the Nutritional Epidemiology Group at Leeds and supervised the research, said, “In the UK most people eat an adequate amount of protein, however, certain groups, such as vegetarians or vegans need to check that their protein intakes are high enough for good health.”Tea and coffee both contain biologically active compounds called polyphenols and phytoestrogens which may help to maintain bone health.Professor Cade added, “This is an interesting finding given that tea and coffee are the UK’s favorite drinks. 

- We still need to know more about how these drinks could affect bone health but it might be through promoting the amount of calcium present in our bones.”(next)Mindfulness meditation trumps placebo in pain reductionWake Forest Medical Center – November 11, 2022Scientists at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center have found new evidence that mindfulness meditation reduces pain more effectively than placebo.

- (next)Shaking less salt on your food at the table could reduce heart disease riskResearchers found a link between a lower frequency of dietary salt and a reduced CVD riskTulane University, November 27, 2022Adding additional salt to foods at a lower frequency is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, heart failure and ischemic heart disease, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. 

- Even among those following a DASH-style diet, behavioral interventions to lessen salt consumption could further improve heart health. 

- “Overall, we found that people who don’t shake on a little additional salt to their foods very often had a much lower risk of heart disease events, regardless of lifestyle factors and pre-existing disease,” said Lu Qi, MD, Regents Distinguished Chair at the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University in New Orleans. 

- “We also found that when patients combine a DASH diet with a low frequency of adding salt, they had the lowest heart disease risk. 

- This is meaningful as reducing additional salt to food, not removing salt entirely, is an incredibly modifiable risk factor that we can hopefully encourage our patients to make without much sacrifice.” In the current study, the authors evaluated whether the frequency of adding salt to foods was linked with incident heart disease risk in 176,570 participants from the UK Biobank. 

- The study also examined the association between the frequency of adding salt to foods and the DASH diet as it relates to heart disease risk. 

- While the DASH diet has yielded benefits in relation to reducing cardiovascular disease risk, a recent clinical trial found that combining the DASH diet with sodium reduction was more beneficial for certain cardiac biomarkers, including cardiac injury, strain, and inflammation. 

- They also had a higher prevalence of high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease, but a lower prevalence of cancer. 

- The researchers found the association of adding salt to foods with heart disease risk was stronger in participants of lower socioeconomic status, as well as in current smokers. 

- A higher modified DASH diet score was associated with lower risk of heart disease events. 

- (next)Ten minutes of aerobic exercise with exposure therapy found to reduce PTSD symptomsUniversity of New South Wales, November 25, 2022Exposure therapy is one of the leading treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but up to a half of all patients don’t respond to it. 

- But now a study led by UNSW Sydney psychologists has found that augmenting the therapy with 10 minutes of aerobic exercise has led to patients reporting greater reduction to PTSD symptom severity six months after the nine-week treatment ended.In the first known single-blind randomized control trial of its kind, researchers in Sydney recruited 130 adults with clinically diagnosed PTSD and assigned them to two groups. 

- People in the aerobic exercise group on average reported lower severity of PTSD symptoms—as measured on the CAPS-2 scale—than those who had their exposure therapy augmented by stretching exercises at the six-month follow-up. 

- Interestingly, there were no clear differences between the two groups one week after the treatment program ended, suggesting the benefits take time to develop. 

- Visceral fat aggregates over time between organs, and produces hormones and poisons linked to heart disease, diabetes, dementia and premature death.

- “The decision to end cervical cancer screening for women after age 65 requires review of past screening results and related medical history. 

- We do not want to see either of these things and unfortunately, there is not enough public health data to shed light on the causes,” said Holt, who is also affiliated with the University of Illinois Cancer Center at UIC. 

- (next)Chemotherapy could increase disease susceptibility in future generationsWashington State University, November 28, 2022A common chemotherapy drug could carry a toxic inheritance for children and grandchildren of adolescent cancer survivors, Washington State University-led research indicates.The study, published online in iScience, found that male rats who received the drug ifosfamide during adolescence had offspring and grand-offspring with increased incidence of disease. 

- While other research has shown that cancer treatments can increase patients’ chance of developing disease later in life, this is one of the first-known studies showing that susceptibility can be passed down to a third generation of unexposed offspring.“The findings suggest that if a patient receives chemotherapy, and then later has children, that their grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren, may have an increased disease susceptibility due to their ancestors’ chemotherapy exposure,” said Michael Skinner, a WSU biologist and corresponding author on the study.Given this study’s implications, the researchers recommend that cancer patients who plan to have children later take precautions, such as using cryopreservation to freeze sperm or ova before having chemotherapy.In the study, researchers exposed a set of young male rats to ifosfamide over three days, mimicking a course of treatment an adolescent human cancer patient might receive. 

- The resulting offspring were bred again with another set of unexposed rats.The first-generation offspring had some exposure to the chemotherapy drug since their fathers’ sperm was exposed, but researchers found greater incidence of disease in not only the first- but also the second-generation, who had no direct exposure to the drug.

- They found that the waves improved the creation of blood vessels and the rate of regeneration of nerve cells.Furthermore, the treatment did not cause any notable side effects on the mice. 

- The results led the researchers to believe that they can replicate their experimental success in actual human patients one day.“The LIPUS therapy is a non-invasive physiotherapy that could apply to high-risk elderly patients without the need for surgery or anaesthesia, and could be used repeatedly,” explained TU researcher Hiroaki Shimokawa.The Tohoku researchers applied LIPUS therapy to the whole brain of mice with symptoms that resemble those of Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. 

- These animals underwent LIPUS treatment on the first, third, and fifth days after that surgery. 

- Meanwhile, the mice that modeled Alzheimer’s disease got 11 LIPUS treatments over a three-month-long trial period.By the end of the experiment, the researchers found that LIPUS activated genes involved with the cells that made up the inner lining of blood vessels. 

- Chronic inflammation, a response by the body to infection and tissue damage, has been linked to the development of disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and psoriasis.

- Now, researchers at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts have shown that a holistic food profiling system, Food Compass, identifies better overall health and lower risk for mortality. 

- In a paper published in Nature Communications, researchers assessed whether adults who ate more foods with higher Food Compass scores had better long-term health outcomes and found that they did. 

- It measures nine domains of each item, such as nutrient ratios, food-based ingredients, vitamins, minerals, extent of processing, and additives. 

- For this validation study, researchers used nationally representative dietary records and health data from 47,999 U.S. adults aged 20-85 who were enrolled between 1999-2018 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 

- Food Compass also boosts scores for ingredients shown to have protective effects on health, like fruits, non-starchy vegetables, beans and legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, seafood, yogurt, and plant oils; and lowers scores for less healthful ingredients like refined grains, red and processed meat, and ultra-processed foods and additives.

- (NEXT)6 Health Benefits Of Rutin, And Where To Find ItGreenMedInfo, November 24, 2022Rutin is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory powerhouse found in a variety of delicious food that may boost your health via multiple avenues, from promoting healthy circulation to providing pain relief.Rutin is one of about 4,000 types of flavonoids that are found abundantly in plants. 

- This makes it valuable in a number of disease conditions and even as a tool for healthy aging. 

- Some of its top health benefits follow.Protection From Neurodegenerative DiseaseRutin has demonstrated benefits to the central nervous system, including prevention of neuroinflammation, anticonvulsant activity and antidepressant effects. 

- Rutin may be useful for recovery after stroke and also shows promise for Alzheimer’s disease.With an ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, rutin may benefit the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and helps to remove the inflammatory component of neurodegeneration.Relieve Arthritis PainRutin not only has analgesic and antinociceptive effects but also antiarthritic effects, making it an ideal natural option for arthritis.The plant compound has been found to suppress oxidative stress in people with rheumatoid arthritis,while also inhibiting both the acute and chronic phases of inflammation in an arthritis rat model.Antidiabetic EffectsRutin has beneficial effects on the endocrine system, including antidiabetic and anti-hypercholesterolemic effects. 

- Research by Harvard Medical School researchers suggests that rutin is effective against both platelet-rich clots that form in arteries and fibrin-rich clots that form in veins.Rutin was found to be a “champion compound” for inhibiting protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which plays a role in the initial stages of clot formation. 

- A nano-formulation of rutin was also found to exert powerful antithrombotic effects by inhibiting PDI,while rutin may also augment the production of nitric oxide in human endothelial cells, which is useful for blood pressure and cardiovascular system health.In terms of improved circulation, rutin is a venoactive compound, which means it may be useful for symptoms of chronic venous diseases (CVD). 

- It also has potential against inflammatory bowel disease, not only due to its antioxidant effects but also by suppressing the release of proinflammatory mediators and the expression of inflammatory proteins.Top Sources of RutinAs noted in the Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal, “An ancient saying ‘an apple a day, keeps doctor away’ seems to be true as rutin, one of the important constituents of apples, has a wide array of biological activities.”

- Roughly 10% of American women continue to smoke in pregnancy, each year resulting in about 400,000 infants being exposed to smoke in-utero, or in the uterus.In-utero smoke exposure from maternal smoking during pregnancy can be dangerous for a developing baby and is linked to poor health outcomes, including impaired fetal lung development, decreased airway function and an increased risk for wheezing and asthma. 

- Additionally, decreased airway growth early in life causes increased risk for serious lifelong conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is now the third leading cause of death worldwide.For this study, participating women were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial to receive either vitamin C (500 mg/day) or a placebo.Statistical analyses showed that the effect of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers prior to 23 weeks of gestation consistently resulted in significantly better airway function in their offspring at 5 years old.While the findings may improve the health of the many children who face in-utero smoke exposure, these findings may have even broader implications: The results may potentially lead to better understanding of—and treatments for—the health impacts of other smoke exposures, including indoor and outdoor air pollution, vaping and wildfires.Decades of air pollution undermine the immune system, lymph nodes study findsColumbia University Irving Medical Center, November 23, 2022The diminished power of the immune system in older adults is usually blamed on the aging process.

- The present study also involves scientists from Leipzig who work in the fields of cardiology and laboratory medicine.The researchers then asked whether a healthy diet could reduce the disease-causing molecular signatures induced by a bad diet. 

- Their results show that a healthy diet can indeed improve the molecular health of blood vessels, albeit only partially. 

- For instance, the blood vessels in the liver recovered nearly completely, but blood vessels in the kidneys retained the disease signature, despite a healthy diet and significant weight loss. 

- This means that some of our blood vessels can develop a “memory” of metabolic disease, which is difficult to reverse.Lab mice fed processed food found to fare worse against flu than those eating grainsUniversity of Sydney & Shenzhen University School of Medicine (China), November 21, 2022A team of researchers at the University of Sydney working with a colleague from Shenzhen University School of Medicine has found that lab mice are more likely to survive a flu infection if they are fed grain-based foods rather than processed food. 

- The paper is published in Cell Reports.In recent years, medical researchers have reported evidence that diet plays a larger role in illness recovery than was thought. 

- As part of that effort, they inadvertently fed two groups of lab mice slightly different meals that were thought to be equivalent in nutritional value and hence unlikely to have an impact on disease recovery. 

- The researchers note that prior studies had shown that mice fed either diet when not battling an infection displayed little difference in health or behavior. 

- “Therefore, the goal of our study was to analyze whether NSAID treatment influences the development or progression of synovitis and to investigate whether cartilage imaging biomarkers, which reflect changes in osteoarthritis, are impacted by NSAID treatment.”“In this large group of participants, we were able to show that there were no protective mechanisms from NSAIDs in reducing inflammation or slowing down progression of osteoarthritis of the knee joint,” the study author reports.

- We found that people who ate almonds experienced changes in their appetite-regulating hormones, and that these may have contributed to reduced food intake (by 300kJ).”The study found that people who ate almonds had 47 per cent lower C-peptide responses (which can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease); and higher levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (18 per cent higher), glucagon (39 per cent higher), and pancreatic polypeptide responses (44 per cent higher). 

- Glucagon sends satiety signals to the brain, while pancreatic polypeptide slows digestion which may reduce food intake, both encouraging weight loss.“Almonds are high in protein, fibre, and unsaturated fatty acids, which may contribute to their satiating properties and help explain why fewer kilojoules were consumed.”The findings of this study show that eating almonds produce small changes to people’s energy intake, Dr Carter says this may have clinical effects in the long term.Probiotics help maintain a healthy microbiome when taken with antibioticsTexas Christian University, November 18 2022.A systematic review published in the Journal of Medical Microbiology helps answer the question concerning whether probiotics should be taken along with antibiotics to support gut health.Although probiotics decrease the adverse gastrointestinal effects caused by antibiotics, their ability to preserve intestinal microbial composition that is negatively impacted by antibiotic therapy is not well understood.“Like in a human community, we need people that have different professions because we don’t all know how to do every single job,” she explained. 

- “But when treatment was combined with probiotics, the majority of those changes were less pronounced and some changes were completely prevented.”New study shows repeated stress accelerates aging of the eyeUniversity of California, Irvine, November 21, 2022New research from the University of California, Irvine, suggests aging is an important component of retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma, and that novel pathways can be targeted when designing new treatments for glaucoma patients.The study was published today in Aging Cell. 

- Due to IOP fluctuations, a single IOP measurement is often insufficient to characterize the real pathology and risk of disease progression in glaucoma patients.Long-term IOP fluctuation has been reported to be a strong predictor for glaucoma progression. 

- This new study suggests that the cumulative impact of the fluctuations of IOP is directly responsible for the aging of the tissue.Researchers now have a new tool to estimate the impact of stress and treatment on the aging status of retinal tissue, which has made these new discoveries possible. 

- Parnia, who served as lead investigator of the study, explained that he and the other researchers undertook this research in an attempt to scientifically explore something that health professionals have discussed anecdotally for decades: The similar stories people revived by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) often tell about the time when their hearts stopped.“For decades now, millions of people who’ve gone through this have reported having lucid heightened consciousness, even though from the perspective of their doctors they were not conscious and they were in death,” Dr. Parnia told MNT.The study centered around 567 men and women who received CPR after their hearts stopped beating while at one of 25 participating hospitals in the United States and the United Kingdom.When health practitioners began CPR on a patient whose heart stopped, researchers rushed to the scene, bringing along a portable electroencephalogram, or EEG, to monitor electrical activity in different parts of the brain, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure oxygen saturation of superficial brain cortex regions. 

- Taking care not to get in the way of health practitioners performing CPR, researchers also clamped a tablet computer above the patient’s head. 

- Only 53, or fewer than 10% of the participants, lived to be discharged from the hospital.Of those 53, 25 were unable to be interviewed by researchers due to poor health. 

- Two of the 28 participants could hear the medical staff working while receiving CPR. 

- One participant recalled seeing the medical staff working and could feel someone rubbing his chest.Using the near-death scale, six participants had transcendent experiences. 

- According to the researchers, this is the first time such biomarkers of consciousness have been identified during CPR for cardiac arrest.“We found the brain electrical markers of heightened […] lucid consciousness, the same markers as you get in people who are having memory retrievals who are having […] high order cognitive processes, except that this was occurring when the brain had shut down.Research suggests agmatine can boost brain health and uplift your mood naturallyYonsei University College of Medicine (S Korea), October 28, 2022.Athletes and bodybuilders are always eager to learn more about new products that can help enhance their workouts by promoting strength and stamina. 

- Agmatine, a natural compound, is often used by health enthusiasts as a pre-workout supplement.According to research, agmatine can also potentially be used to boost brain health and improve mood.In one scientific review, researchers suggest that the compound can help prevent neurodegenerative diseases and assist in the recovery of brain injury patients.Agmatine or 4-aminobutyl-guanidine is produced in your body from arginine, an amino acid found in foods like chickpeas, lentils, pork and poultry.When used as a pre-workout supplement, experts recommend not taking it with protein since dietary protein can slow the absorption of agmatine. 

- This suggests taking agmatine can help make you feel more inclined to exercise.The compound may also help block aged glycation end products. 

- However, a new study from Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University, published in the Journal of Medicinal Food, says that potatoes actually did not increase that risk, are filled with key nutrients, and packed with health benefits. 

- Insulin resistance refers to a health condition in which the body’s cells do not respond well to insulin and glucose does not enter into the cells to make energy. 

- When we compared a diet with potatoes to a diet with beans and peas, we found them to be equal in terms of health benefits,” Rebello said. 

- In addition, potatoes are a fairly inexpensive vegetable to incorporate into a diet.”(NEXT)Celery Seed Extract Lowers High Blood Pressure in Human StudyUniversity of Chicago Medical Center, November 8, 2022Drugs to lower blood pressure are among the most commonly prescribed medicines in the U.S. More than 678 million blood pressure prescriptions were filled in 2010. 

- All of the current classes of blood pressure lowering drugs possess significant side effects.A recent study with a special extract of celery seed extract indicates that it may produce clinical results without producing the side effects that plague current drug treatment. 

- These results indicate that celery seed extract may produce the greatest blood pressure-lowering effects in natural products available on health food store shelves. 

- (NEXT)Exercise during pregnancy gives newborn brain development a head startUniversity of Montreal, November 10, 2022As little as 20 minutes of moderate exercise three times per week during pregnancy enhances the newborn child’s brain development, according to researchers at the University of Montreal and its affiliated CHU Sainte-Justine children’s hospital. 

- “Our research indicates that exercise during pregnancy enhances the newborn child’s brain development,” explained Professor Dave Ellemberg, who led the study. 

- “While animal studies have shown similar results, this is the first randomized controlled trial in humans to objectively measure the impact of exercise during pregnancy directly on the newborn’s brain.We hope these results will guide public health interventions and research on brain plasticity. 

- Most of all, we are optimistic that this will encourage women to change their health habits, given that the simple act of exercising during pregnancy could make a difference for their child’s future.” Not so long ago, obstetricians would tell women to take it easy and rest during their pregnancy. 

- Recently, the tides have turned and it is now commonly accepted that inactivity is actually a health concern. 

- “Given that exercise has been demonstrated to be beneficial for the adult’s brain, we hypothesized that it could also be beneficial for the unborn child through the mother’s actions.” To verify this, starting at the beginning of their second trimester, women were randomly assigned to an exercise group or a sedentary group. 

- Women in the exercise group had to perform at least 20 minutes of cardiovascular exercise three times per week at a moderate intensity, which should lead to at least a slight shortness of breath. 

- Women in the sedentary group did not exercise. 

- Nearly all regions in the study experienced fewer COVID-19 cases and deaths during periods when estimated indoor relative humidity was within a “sweet spot” between 40 and 60%.“There’s potentially a protective effect of this intermediate indoor relative humidity,” suggests lead author Connor Verheyen, a Ph.D. student in medical engineering and medical physics in the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. 

- (NEXT)Being comfortable with aging can benefit sex lifeUniversity of Missouri, November 17, 2022Researchers have long known that having a positive outlook can benefit a person’s health.Now, a new study by the University of Missouri has found older adults who feel positively about aging have a healthier sex life—a finding that didn’t surprise the researcher, who’s been studying the benefits of the positive perceptions of aging.”We know positive perceptions of aging can be really beneficial, but when they are negative, they can be really detrimental. 

- Negative perceptions of aging are linked to higher likelihood of cognitive decline, higher likelihood of cardiovascular disease and even shorter lifespans. 

- Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) are reported to be UVA1/UVB radiation-inducible genes.“On top of that, as part of the photo-aging process we have evidence of the effect of our ingredients on the levels of expression of genes involved in collagen degradation, suggesting a link not only to skin health but also to skin appearance. 

- This study suggests an effect of natural antioxidants on overall skin wellness, which is relevant for men and women in all age groups.” The new study included 65 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 60. 

- The administration of DAT suppressed the development of PEL cells and ascites in SCID mice xenografted with PEL cells.” According to the news editors, the research concluded: “These findings provide evidence that DAT has antitumor activity against PEL cells in-vitro and in-vivo, suggesting it to be a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of PEL.”(NEXT)PTSD May Speed Up Cellular AgingBoston University, November 13, 2022From birth to death, a lot may change, but our DNA—the long, double-helix molecule that contains all of a person’s genetic code—stays the same. 

- (NEXT)Higher sense of purpose in life may be linked to lower mortality riskBoston University, November 14, 2022Growing research indicates that one’s purpose—i.e., the extent to which someone perceives a sense of direction and goals in their life—may be linked to health-protective benefits such as better physical functioning and lower risks of cardiovascular disease or cognitive decline. 

- Now, a new study led by a Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) researcher found that people with higher levels of purpose may have a lower risk of death from any cause, and that this association is applicable across race/ethnicity and gender. 

- The team also gathered data on additional factors that can influence health, such socioeconomic status, other demographic characteristics, baseline physical health, and depression, and found that an increase in these factors was also associated with increases in a higher sense of purpose. 

- (NEXT)Hibiscus compound shows anti-Alzheimer disease activityPohang University of Science and Technology,November 16 2022.A report published in Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy revealed that gossypetin, a flavonoid occurring in the calyx of the hibiscus flower, activates a process that reduces brain accumulation of amyloid beta, a protein that clumps to form toxic brain plaques in people with Alzheimer disease. 

- Earlier research had suggested a benefit for gossypetin, which is structurally similar to quercetin, against the aggregation of amyloid beta and tau proteins that occurs in Alzheimer disease. 

- However, gossypetin’s action in animal models of the disease had not been evaluated.Researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology administered gossypetin or a control substance to mice that were bred to develop a condition similar to that of Alzheimer disease in humans. 

- After 13 weeks of daily treatment, mice that received the flavonoid had less amyloid beta in the brain’s hippocampus (an area involved in memory and learning) and cortex in comparison with the control mice.

- The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 430 million people worldwide currently have disabling hearing loss. 

- The participants were tasked to complete three two-week treatment cycles with 960 milligrams (mg) of the Korean ginseng supplement, 160 mg of the Korean ginseng supplement, or a placebo, separated by a one-week washout period. 

- After the treatment, the participants underwent an intense resistance exercise to induce physical stress. 

- The participants also provided blood samples at rest and at various points after the exercise, particularly immediately, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 24 hours after exercise. 

- In addition, the high dose of the Korean ginseng supplement (960 mg) greatly reduced muscle damage and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) responses to physical stress 24 hours after the intense exercise. 

- Based on the findings of the study, the researchers concluded that taking Korean ginseng supplements can help ward off mental and physical stress by reducing cortisol levels and muscle damage.When low-income families can meet their basic needs, children are healthierBoston Medical Center, November 8, 2022A series of reports from five cities across the US found that young children and their parents are healthier when they are able to afford basic needs. 

- New research published by Children’s HealthWatch, headquartered at Boston Medical Center, highlights the need for policymakers to improve access to and effectiveness of programs that enable all families with low incomes to afford basic needs such as food, shelter, utilities, medical care, prescription medicines and childcare.Researchers surveyed more than 18,000 families of children under age 4 in the emergency departments and primary care clinics at urban hospitals in Baltimore, Boston, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and Little Rock. 

- The study team created a composite measure of hardships that included a family’s ability to afford food, utilities, and health care, and maintain stable housing. 

- All hardships described in the study have previously been associated with poor child and caregiver health. 

- In all cities, living in a hardship-free family was associated with good overall health for children and caregivers, positive developmental outcomes for young children, and positive mental healthamong mothers. 

- Nearly half of families interviewed at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis reported that they were hardship-free. 

- At Boston Medical Center, only about one quarter of the families surveyed reported zero hardships, which may be due to higher housing costs. 

- The research teams advocate for implementing policies to increase wages, along with ensuring access to programs that support low-income families being able to meet basic needs, such as food and housing security and medical care. 

- Further, the authors suggested screening for hardships in health care settings and connecting patients and their families to resources that promote health.

- Will the crony medical establishment listen? 

- When faced with the choice of a cheap, safe, and effective natural immune defense against the flu, or an expensive, dangerous, and ineffective vaccine that makes drug companies billions of dollars—which will our crony health officials choose? 

- What this means is that most Americans are not getting the vitamin D they need, in part because health authorities at the IOM and elsewhere in the government are mistaken when telling Americans how much to take. 

- It is a crime that health authorities are not telling people to take vitamin D supplements.

- (next)Morning physical activity is associated with the lowest risk of heart disease and strokeLeiden University Medical Centre (Netherlands), November 14, 2022Morning physical activity is associated with the lowest risk of heart disease and stroke, according to a study in more than 85,000 individuals published today in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology. 

- The findings were consistent regardless of the total amount of daily activity.The study included 86,657 adults aged 42 to 78 years who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. 

- During six to eight years of follow up, 2,911 participants developed coronary artery disease and 796 had a stroke. 

- Comparing peak activity times across a 24 hour period, being most active between 8 am and 11 am was linked with the lowest risks of both heart disease and stroke. 

- The categories were selected according to peak times of activity in the study population, rather than being pre-determined before the study began.Participants who were most active in the early morning or late morning had 11% and 16% lower risks of incident coronary artery disease, respectively, compared to the reference group. 

- Women who were most active in the early morning or late morning had 22% and 24% lower risks of incident coronary artery disease, respectively, compared to the reference group.

- Half then received 5% standardized grape powder while the other half didn’t.Compared to mice not fed the grape powder, the mice given grape powder saw beneficial increases in antioxidant genes, reductions in fatty liver, and extended lifespans.The lead author estimated that when translated to humans, the extended lifespan would correspond to an additional 4-5 years in the life of a human.The grape powder used in this study was composed of fresh red, green and black grapes that were freeze-dried to retain their bioactive compounds.The researchers concluded: “These results suggest the potential of dietary grapes to modulate hepatic gene expression, prevent oxidative damage, induce fatty acid metabolism, ameliorate NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), and increase longevity when co-administered with a high-fat diet.”Study: Neuroprotective Effect of Virgin Coconut Oil Helps Relieve ALSKatholieke University (Belgium), November 6, 2022  An animal study looked into the potential of coconut oil for preventing or reducing ALS symptoms.Coconut oil has already demonstrated safe efficacy for treating Alzheimer’s disease symptoms, which is also a neurodegenerative disease for which mainstream medicine has no answer. 

- 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy is ideal for ALS treatment diagnostics and research. 

- [The study results] revealed that the coconut oil supplementation together with the regular diet delayed disease symptoms, enhanced motor performance, and prolonged survival in the SOD1G93A mouse model. 

- … this is the first study that reports metabolic changes in the brainstem using in vivo MRS and effects of coconut oil supplementation as a prophylactic treatment in SOD1G93A mice.One of the major metabolites NAA (N-acetylaspartate), has been observed as an integral part of neuron loss, which is a major factor of onset ALS when it is diminished from the central nervous system. 

- NAA reduction was greater in the non-coconut oil fed group of rats, indicating those on coconut oil were experiencing less neurodegeneration and neuronal destruction.Aerobic activity can reduce the risk of metastatic cancer by 72%Tel Aviv University (Israel), November 14, 2022A new study at Tel Aviv University found that aerobic exercise can reduce the risk of metastatic cancer by 72%. 

- According to the researchers, intensity aerobic exercise increases the glucose (sugar) consumption of internal organs, thereby reducing the availability of energy to the tumor.The study was led by two researchers from TAU’s Sackler Faculty of Medicine.Prof. 

- Levy and Dr. Gepner said, “Studies have demonstrated that physical exercise reduces the risk for some types of cancer by up to 35%. 

- This positive effect is similar to the impact of exercise on other conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes. 

- In this study we added new insight, showing that high-intensity aerobic exercise, which derives its energy from sugar, can reduce the risk of metastatic cancer by as much as 72%. 

- If so far the general message to the public has been ‘be active, be healthy,’ now we can explain how aerobic activity can maximize the prevention of the most aggressive and metastatic types of cancer.”The study combined an animal model in which mice were trained under a strict exercise regimen, with data from healthy human volunteers examined before and after running. 

- The human data, obtained from an epidemiological study that monitored 3,000 individuals for about 20 years, indicated 72% less metastatic cancer in participants who reported regular aerobic activity at high intensity, compared to those who did not engage in physical exercise.They found that aerobic activity significantly reduced the development of metastatic tumors in the lymph nodes, lungs, and liver. 

- The researchers hypothesized that in both humans and model animals, this favorable outcome is related to the enhanced rate of glucose consumption induced by exercise.Prof. 

- Levy stated, “Our study is the first to investigate the impact of exercise on the internal organs in which metastases usually develop, like the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes.“Consequently, if cancer develops, the fierce competition over glucose reduces the availability of energy that is critical to metastasis. 

- We all know that sports and physical exercise are good for our health. 

- Our study, examining the internal organs, discovered that exercise changes the whole body, so that the cancer cannot spread, and the primary tumor also shrinks in size.”Dr. 

- Gepner adds, “Our results indicate that unlike fat-burning exercise, which is relatively moderate, it is a high-intensity aerobic activity that helps in cancer prevention. 

- Eschewing all animal products appears to be key for these positive results.Uterine fibroid growth activated by chemicals found in everyday productsNorthwestern University, November 14, 2022For the first time, scientists at Northwestern Medicine have demonstrated a causal link between environmental phthalates (toxic chemicals found in everyday consumer products) and the increased growth of uterine fibroids, the most common tumors among women.Manufacturers use environmental phthalates in numerous industrial and consumer products, and they’ve also been detected in medical supplies and food.

Carlson, PhD, principal investigator and director of research in the Psychosocial Resources Department at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre.“It was surprising that we could see any difference in telomere length at all over the three-month period studied,” says Dr. Carlson, who is also a U of C professor in the Faculty of Arts and the Cumming School of Medicine, and a member of the Southern Alberta Cancer Institute. 

- “Further research is needed to better quantify these potential health benefits, but this is an exciting discovery that provides encouraging news.”The study was published online in the journal Cancer.A total of 88 breast cancer survivors who had completed their treatments for at least three months were involved for the duration of the study. 

- The average age was 55 and most participants had ended treatment two years prior. 

- Of the 68 diseases and conditions that lion’s mane mushroom may support, many of them relate to the nervous system, including cognitive function, memory, dementia, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders.Lion’s mane mushroom contains more than 35 beneficial polysaccharides that may help prevent or treat cancer, gastric ulcers, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, liver injury and neurodegenerative diseases, according to a review published in the International Journal of Biological Macromolecules.With a long history of use in Traditional Chinese Medicine, including for brain and neurological health, it’s now known that two terpenoid compounds– hericenones and erinacines — in these mushrooms and their mycelia may stimulate the synthesis of nerve growth factor (NGF).Active compounds in lion’s mane mushrooms may also delay neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases, including ischemic stroke, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and depression, while promoting nerve regeneration in cases of neuropathic pain or age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). 

- Animal studies suggest that lion’s mane may reverse depressive behaviors caused by stress by modulating monoamine neurotransmitters and regulating BDNF pathways.Support for Neurodegenerative Disease – neurotrophic compounds are known to pass through the blood-brain barrier and have been used to treat cognitive impairments, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.

- These molecules interacted with amyloid-beta (a substance that forms sticky plaques in the brains of Alzheimer disease patients), to prevent it from forming fibrils and becoming toxic. 

- The Tettnang variety of hops proved to be the most successful of the four varieties tested.“The identification of natural compounds or natural mixtures, such as nutraceuticals, exploitable for the development of preventive strategies against Alzheimer disease (and other neurodegenerative diseases) appears as a better alternative to the treatment of symptoms, as the neuronal damage associated with the disease is irreversible,” the authors remarked. 

- “Our results show that hop is a source of bioactive molecules with synergistic and multitarget activity against the early events underlying Alzheimer disease development. 

- We can therefore think of its use for the preparation of nutraceuticals useful for the prevention of this pathology.”Healthy plant-based diets better for the environment than less healthy plant-based dietsHarvard School of Public Health, November 10. 

- 2022Healthier plant-based dietary patterns are associated with better environmental health, while less healthy plant-based dietary patterns, which are higher in foods like refined grains and sugar-sweetened beverages, require more cropland and fertilizer, according to a new study led by researchers at Harvard T.H. 

- Chan School of Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 

- The findings also showed that red and processed meat had the highest environmental impact out of all food groups in participants’ diets, producing the greatest share of greenhouse gas emissions and requiring the most irrigation water, cropland, and fertilizer.“The differences between plant-based diets was surprising because they’re often portrayed as universally healthy and good for the environment, but it’s more nuanced than that,” said Aviva Musicus, postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard Chan School and corresponding author of the study.Previous research has documented that different types of plant-based diets have various health effects. 

- For example, plant-based diets higher in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, vegetable oils, and tea/coffee are associated with reduced chronic disease risk, while plant-based diets high in fruit juices, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes, and sweets/desserts are associated with an increased risk of chronic disease. 

- Yet little research has been conducted to determine the environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions, use of high-quality cropland, nitrogen from fertilizer, and irrigation water, of these dietary approaches.The researchers analyzed the food intakes of more than 65,000 qualifying participants, and examined their diets’ associations with health outcomes, including relative risks of cardiovascular disease, and with environmental impacts. 

- Higher scores on the unhealthy plant-based diet index indicated higher consumption of refined grains, sugary drinks, fruit juice, potatoes, and sweets/desserts; while higher scores on the healthy plant-based diet index indicated higher consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, legumes, vegetable oils, and tea/coffee.Participants who consumed healthy plant-based diets had lower cardiovascular disease risk, and those diets had lower greenhouse gas emissions and use of cropland, irrigation water, and nitrogenous fertilizer than diets that were higher in unhealthy plant-based and animal-based foods.Participants who ate unhealthy plant-based diets experienced a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, and their diets required more cropland and fertilizer than diets that were higher in healthy plant-based and animal foods. 

- The findings also reinforced earlier studies showing that diets higher in animal-based foods, especially red and processed meat, have greater adverse environmental impacts than plant-based diets.Removing digital devices from the bedroom can improve sleep for children, teensPenn State University, November 4, 2022Removing electronic media from the bedroom and encouraging a calming bedtime routine are among recommendations Penn State researchers outline in a recent manuscript on digital media and sleep in childhood and adolescence.The recommendations, for clinicians and parents, are:Make sleep a priority by talking with family members about the importance of sleep and healthy sleep expectations;Encourage a bedtime routine that includes calming activities and avoids electronic media use;Encourage families to remove all electronic devices from their child or teen’s bedroom, including TVs, video games, computers, tablets and cell phones;Talk with family members about the negative consequences of bright light in the evening on sleep; andIf a child or adolescent is exhibiting mood or behavioral problems, consider insufficient sleep as a contributing factor.“Recent reviews of scientific literature reveal that the vast majority of studies find evidence for an adverse association between screen-based media consumption and sleep health, primarily delayed bedtimes and reduced total sleep duration,” said Orfeu Buxton, associate professor of biobehavioral health at Penn State.The reasons behind this adverse association likely include time spent on screens replacing time spent sleeping; mental stimulation from media content; and the effects of light interrupting sleep cycles, according to the researchers.Black Sesame Seed Reduces High Blood PressureMahidol University (Thailand), November 10, 2022Research from Thailand’s Mahidol University has found that black sesame seeds can significantly reduce blood pressure among men and women.The research tested 30 men and women with an average age of 50 years old. 

- That’s why two 50-year-olds, despite living the same number of years, may have different biological ages—meaning that a host of intrinsic and extrinsic factors have caused them to age at varying paces with different levels of risk for disease and early death. 

- The clocks were originally modeled from various studies examining diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, physical disability, Alzheimer’s disease, inflammation and early mortality.Results reveal that both older men and women showed an association between lower grip strength and biological age acceleration across the DNA methylation clocks.“We’ve known that muscular strength is a predictor of longevity, and that weakness is a powerful indicator of disease and mortality, but for the first time, we have found strong evidence of a biological link between muscle weakness and actual acceleration in biological age,” said Mark Peterson, Ph.D., M.S. 

- We know that smoking, for example, can be a powerful predictor of disease and mortality, but now we know that muscle weakness could be the new smoking.”The real strength of this study was in the 8 to 10 years of observation, in which lower grip strength predicted faster biological aging measured up to a decade later, said Jessica Faul, Ph.D., M.P.H., a co-author of the study and research associate professor at the U-M Institute for Social Research.Past studies have shown that low grip strength is an extremely strong predictor of adverse health events. 

- Peterson and his team have previously shown a robust association between weakness and chronic disease and mortality across populations. 

- The researchers looked at biomarkers of oxidative stress in the blood, urine and prostate tissue.They found a greater antioxidant intake was associated with lower urinary 8-isoprostane concentrations.A 10% increase in antioxidant intake saw an unadjusted 1.1% decrease in urinary 8-isoprostane levels.8-Isoprostane has been described as a “reliable marker”  and recognised  “gold standard” for lipid peroxidation – the oxidative degradation of lipids.“This study demonstrated that intake of antioxidants was associated with less oxidative stress among men with incident prostate cancer,” the researchers concluded in the British Journal of Nutrition.“The results of this study and others warrant additional research in humans on the mechanisms underlying the relationship between dietary antioxidants and prostate tissue redox status and carcinogenesis, as well as determining whether this relationship may influence disease severity, progression and recurrence.”High-intensity exercise changes how muscle cells manage calciumKarolinska Institute (Sweden) November 2, 2022Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have discovered a cellular mechanism behind the surprising benefits of short, high-intensity interval exercise. 

- Their findings, which are published in the scientific journal PNAS, also provide clues to why antioxidants undermine the effect of endurance training.A few minutes of high-intensity interval exercise is enough to produce an effect at least equivalent to that achieved with traditional much more time-consuming endurance training. 

- High-intensity exercise has become popular with sportspeople and recreational joggers alike, as well as with patients with impaired muscle function. 

- However, one question has so far remained unanswered: how can a few minutes’ high-intensity exercise be so effective?To investigate what happens in muscle cells during high-intensity exercise, the researchers asked male recreational exercisers to do 30 seconds of maximum exertion cycling followed by four minutes of rest, and to repeat the procedure six times. 

- They then took muscle tissue samples from their thighs.“Our study shows that three minutes of high-intensity exercise breaks down calcium channels in the muscle cells,” says Professor Håkan Westerblad, principal investigator at Karolinska Institutet’s Department of Physiology and Pharmacology. 

- What the researchers found was that the breakdown of calcium channels that was triggered by the high-intensity exercise was caused by an increase in free radicals, which are very reactive and oxidise cellular proteins.The cells therefore have antioxidative systems for trapping and neutralising the radicals. 

- Antioxidants, like vitamins E and C, are also present in food and are common ingredients in dietary supplements. 

- In the present study, the researchers examined what happens when isolated mouse muscles are treated with an antioxidant before and after simulated high-intensity interval exercise.“Our study shows that antioxidants remove the effect on the calcium channels, which might explain why they can weaken muscular response to endurance training,” says Professor Westerblad. 

- “Our results also show that the calcium channels aren’t affected by the three minutes of high-intensity interval exercise in elite endurance athletes, who have built up more effective antioxidative systems.”8 Weeks Of Mindfulness Training Can Lower Blood Pressure For MonthsBrown University, November 8, 2022A custom mindfulness program which teaches people how to have healthy relationships with their diet, physical activity, alcohol use, and stress can help lower blood pressure for at least six months, a new study finds.A team with the American Heart Association found that eight weeks of mindfulness training significantly lowers systolic blood pressure readings — the top number in a blood pressure measurement. 

- Mindfulness also involves the concept of remembering, or in other words, remembering to bring one’s wisdom (wherever it was gained, such as from health care professionals or public health messages) into the present moment. 

- Then you may want to consider adding grapefruit juice into your diet.Because a recent study found that grapefruit juice enriched with the flavonoid naringenin actually improved a marker associated with arterial function.The results of the study were published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Previous research shows citrus bioflavonoids support blood vessel function. 

- It’s also available as a dietary supplement and is usually found in citrus bioflavonoid formulas.Low levels of air pollution deadlier than previously thoughtMcGill University, November 7, 2022The World Health Organization’s most recent estimates (2016) are that over 4.2 million people die prematurely each year due to long-term exposure to fine particulate outdoor air pollution (often referred to as PM2.5). 

- These microscopic toxins cause a range of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cancers.“We found that outdoor PM2.5 may be responsible for as many as 1.5 million additional deaths around the globe each year because of effects at very-low concentrations that were not previously appreciated,” said Scott Weichenthal, an Associate Professor at McGill University and the lead author on the recent paper in Science Advances.The researchers arrived at this conclusion by combining health and mortality data for seven million Canadians gathered over a twenty-five-year period with information about the levels of outdoor PM2.5 concentrations across the country.The WHO recently set out ambitious new guidelines for annual average outdoor fine particulate air pollution, cutting its earlier recommendations in half, from concentrations of 10 to concentrations of 5 micrograms (ug) per cubic meter. 

- Surgeon General’s report that established that tobacco was addictive and applied it to food.Based on the criteria set for tobacco, the findings indicate that highly processed foods can be addictive, said lead author Ashley Gearhardt, U-M associate professor of psychology, and Alexandra DiFeliceantonio, assistant professor at Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at Virginia Tech.In fact, the addictive potential for food such as potato chips, cookies, ice cream and French fries may be a key factor contributing to the high public health costs associated with a food environment dominated by cheap, accessible and heavily marketed highly processed foods, the researchers said.The research, published in the current issue of Addiction, offers evidence that highly processed foods meet the same criteria used to identify cigarettes as an addictive substance:They trigger compulsive use where people are unable to quit or cut down (even in the face of life-threatening diseases like diabetes and heart disease)They can change the way we feel and cause changes in the brain that are of a similar magnitude as the nicotine in tobacco productsThey are highly reinforcingThey trigger intense urges and cravingsDiFeliceantonio said the ability of highly processed foods to rapidly deliver unnaturally high doses of refined carbohydrates and fat appear key to their addictive potential.Highly processed foods contain complex substances that cannot be simplified to a single chemical agent acting through a specific central mechanism.

- There was no significant documented difference in bone mass in the spine or hip socket between the groups one year after the study began.Tracing tomatoes’ health benefits to gut microbesOhio State University, November 7, 2022Two weeks of eating a diet heavy in tomatoes increased the diversity of gut microbes and altered gut bacteria toward a more favorable profile in young pigs, researchers found.After observing these results with a short-term intervention, the research team plans to progress to similar studies in people, looking for health-related links between tomatoes in the diet and changes to the human gut microbiome – the community of microorganisms living in the gastrointestinal tract.“It’s possible that tomatoes impart benefits through their modulation of the gut microbiome,” said senior author Jessica Cooperstone, assistant professor at The Ohio State University.The tomatoes used in the study were developed by Ohio State plant breeder, tand co-author David Francis, and are the type typically found in canned tomato products.Ten recently weaned control pigs were fed a standard diet and 10 pigs were fed the standard diet fine-tuned so that 10% of the food consisted of a freeze-dried powder made from the tomatoes.Fiber, sugar, protein, fat and calories were identical for both diets. 

- The control and study pig populations lived separately, and researchers running the study minimized their time spent with the pigs – a series of precautions designed to ensure that any microbiome changes seen with the study diet could be attributed to chemical compounds in the tomatoes.Results showed two main changes in the microbiomes of pigs fed the tomato-heavy diet – the diversity of microbe species in their guts increased, and the concentrations of two types of bacteria common in the mammal microbiome shifted to a more favorable profile.This higher ratio of the phyla Bacteroidota (formerly known as Bacteriodetes) compared to Bacillota (formerly known as Firmicutes) present in the microbiome has been found to be linked with positive health outcomes, while other studies have linked this ratio in reverse, of higher Bacillota compared to Bacteroidota, to obesity.Tomatoes account for about 22% of vegetable intake in Western diets, and previous research has associated consumption of tomatoes with reduced risk for the development of various conditions that include cardiovascular disease and some cancers.But tomatoes’ impact on the gut microbiome is still a mystery, and Cooperstone said these findings in pigs – whose gastrointestinal tract is more similar than rodents’ to the human GI system – suggest it’s an avenue worth exploring.New study examines how breathing shapes our brainsAarhus University (Denmark), November 8, 2022“Breathe in… Breathe out…” or “take a deep breath and count to ten.” The calming effect of breathing in stressful situations is a concept most of us have met before.

- So, you have to consume more of it to reach your protein target, which effectively elevates your daily energy intake.The University of Sydney scientists analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey of nutrition and physical activity in 9,341 adults, known as the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey with a mean age of 46.3 years. 

- Consequently, they had an overall poorer diet at each mealtime, with their percentage of protein energy decreasing even as their discretionary food intake rose—an effect the scientists call ‘protein dilution’.While many factors contribute to excess weight gain—including eating patterns, physical activity levels, and sleep routines—the University of Sydney scientists argue the body’s powerful demand for protein, and its lack in highly processed and refined foods, is a key driver of energy overconsumption and obesity in the Western world.Violence on TV: Effects from age 3 can stretch into the teen yearsUniversity of Montreal, November 7, 2022Watching violent TV during the preschool years can lead to later risks of psychological and academic impairment by the summer before middle school starts, according to a new study led by Linda Pagani, a professor at Université de Montréal’s School of Psycho-Education.Before now, “it was unclear to what extent exposure to typical violent screen content in early childhood—a particularly critical time in brain development—can predict later psychological distress and academic risks,” said Pagani.“The detection of early modifiable factors that influence a child’s later well-being is an important target for individual and community health initiatives, and psychological adjustment and academic motivation are essential elements in the successful transition to adolescence,” she added.

- The ability to increase BDNF, therefore, implies it will improve brain and cognitive function.Only recently a new mechanism behind gingko biloba’s brain and neurological tissue healing properties been revealed in the publication of an article in Cell and Molecular Neurobiology titled, “Ginkgo Biloba Extract Enhances Differentiation and Performance of Neural Stem Cells in Mouse Cochlea.”In the new study researchers tested the premise that ginkgo biloba’s wide range of benefits in the treatment of neural damage and disorders is due, in part, to its ability to positively modulate neural stem cells (NSC), a subpopulation of cells within the brain that as multipotent cells are capable of generating the many different types (phenotypes) of cells that make up the brain. 

- Their results, using mouse cochlea-derived neural stem cells, showed a number of ways that gingko biloba exact (GBE) resulted in a beneficial effect:“Our data showed that GBE treatment promotes cell survival and NSC proliferation. 

- In addition, GBE treatment also increases NSC differentiation to neurons and enhances the performance of mature neural networks evident by the increased frequency of calcium oscillation.

- “Dynamic remodeling of mitochondrial networks by fusion and fission promotes maintenance of cellular homeostasis,” explain Heather J. Weir and colleagues at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. 

- “Dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics and aberrant mitochondrial morphology are hallmarks of aging and are thought to contribute to the pathology of numerous age-related pathologies including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.”By restricting calories in the diet of roundworms or using a strain of roundworm in which an AMPK subunit is activated, the researchers found that the roundworms maintained a youthful fused mitochondrial network shape with age. 

- If we lock mitochondria in one state, we completely block the effects of fasting or dietary restriction on longevity.”Electroacupuncture found to ease nausea and vomiting in ICU patients recovering from chemotherapyNarbonne Hospital (France), October 28, 2022Refractory vomiting is just one of many complications endured by patients confined to intensive care units (ICU) due to chemotherapy and other major medical treatments.

- The experimental diets included a lower-fat control diet with no pistachios [25% total fat; 8% saturated fatty acids (SFAs), 9% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and 5% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)], 1 serving/d of a pistachio diet (1 PD; 10% of energy from pistachios; 30% total fat; 8% SFAs, 12% MUFAs, and 6% PUFAs), and 2 servings/d of a pistachio diet (2 PD; 20% of energy from pistachios; 34% total fat; 8% SFAs, 15% MUFAs, and 8% PUFAs).Inclusion of pistachios in a healthy diet beneficially affects CVD risk factors in a dose-dependent manner, which may reflect effects on SCD.Poor quality sleep may be linked to heightened risk of glaucoma, irreversible sight lossSichuan University (China), November 1, 2022Poor quality sleep, including too much or too little shuteye, daytime sleepiness, and snoring, may be linked to a heightened risk of developing irreversible sight loss (glaucoma), suggests a large UK Biobank study published in the open access journal BMJ Open.The findings underscore the need for sleep therapy in people at high risk of the disease as well as eye checks among those with chronic sleep disorders to check for early signs of glaucoma, conclude the researchers.While population screening may not be cost-effective, targeted screening of high-risk groups might be, suggest the researchers. 

- Chronotype was defined according to whether the person described themselves as more of a morning lark or night owl.During an average monitoring period of just over 10.5 years, 8690 cases of glaucoma were identified.Those with glaucoma tended to be older and were more likely to be male, chronic smokers, and to have high blood pressure or diabetes than those who weren’t diagnosed with the disease.Short or long sleep duration was associated with a heightened risk of 8%; insomnia, 12%; snoring, 4%; and frequent daytime sleepiness, 20%.Compared to those with a healthy sleep pattern, snorers and those who experienced daytime sleepiness were 10% more likely to have glaucoma, while insomniacs and those with a short/long sleep duration pattern were 13% more likely to have it.Could a Japanese mushroom extract eradicate HPV?University of Texas Health Science Center October 29, 2022A study by researchers from The University of Texas Health Science Center suggests that an extract from a Japanese mushroom has potential to eradicate human papillomavirus – the leading cause of cervical cancer.HPV is also accountable for around 95% of anal cancers, 65% of vaginal cancers, 60% of oropharyngeal cancers, 50% of vulvar cancers and 35% of penile cancers.

- Alice Creedon explained to Medical News Today: “Butyrate is important to gut health, as it acts as the primary source of fuel for the cells of the colon, allowing them to function correctly and optimally. 

- It is also involved in signaling to the gut to initiate the process of nutrient absorption.”“In addition,” said Dr. Creedon, “butyrate produced in the gut can enter the bloodstream where it is involved in the regulation of health in other areas of the body, such as the liver, brain, and lungs.”The study demonstrates that eating a healthy handful of almonds each day promotes the production of butyrate.Dr. 

- Therefore, increasing fiber in the diet, such as in almonds, increases butyrate levels, which has a positive effect on our gut health,” said Tallman.Additional benefit of omega-3 fatty acids for the clearance of metabolites from the brainFederation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, October 23, 2022New research published online in The FASEB Journal suggests that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are found in fish oil, could improve the function of the glymphatic system, which facilitates the clearance of waste from the brain, and promote the clearance of metabolites including amyloid-β peptides, a primary culprit in Alzheimer’s disease.To make this discovery, scientists first used transgenic fat-1 mice, which express high endogenous omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the brain, to investigate the effect of omega-3 PUFAs on the clearance function of the glymphatic system. 

- Omega-3 PUFAs help maintain the brain homeostasis, which may provide benefits in a number of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and sleep impairment, among others.“These now-famous fatty acids have been the subject of major studies both in academia and industry. 

- “This study should not turn attention away from the roles of these substances in maintaining vascular health, but neither should they restrict our view. 

- The brain is an extremely vascularized organ, while we might also bear in mind that omega-3 fatty acids may impact neurons, glia, and astrocytes themselves.”Are our brains physically shaped by life experiences?University of Ottawa, 23 October 2022The notion that an experience external to the body – not something we have ingested, that has been affected by disease or damaged through physical injury – can measurably change the physical properties of an organ as intrinsic to our functioning as the brain is revelatory. 

- Previously, the results of neuroimaging studies in abused children have been considered to be inconsistent.The researchers found that the participants who had been exposed to maltreatment exhibited significantly smaller volumes of grey matter in several brain regions.“Childhood maltreatment acts as a severe stressor that produces a cascade of physiological and neurobiological changes that lead to enduring alterations in the brain structure,” says author Joaquim Radua.The researchers found that the participants who had been exposed to maltreatment exhibited significantly smaller volumes of grey matter in several brain regions.‘Processed meats have same cancer risk as cigarettes’World Health Organization, October 23, 2022Bacon, ham and sausages have the same cancer risk as cigarettes, according to a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO), a media report said.WHO listed processed meat as a carcinogenic substance, while fresh red meat is also expected to join the encyclopaedia of carcinogens’ and is likely to be regarded as bad for health.The classifications, by the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer, are believed to regard processed meat as “carcinogenic to humans”, the highest of five possible rankings, shared with alcohol, asbestos, arsenic and cigarettes, the daily added.Studies have shown that people who eat a lot of red meat tend to eat fewer plant-based foods that protect against cancer.The WHO report follows a meeting of scientists from 10 countries who reviewed all available evidence.Processed meat is made by smoking, curing, salting, or adding chemicals. 

- Burgers are also expected to be included in the WHO list of carcinogens.Early supplementation may help offset early-life stress on the adult brainUniversity of Amsterdam, October 25, 20229Early-life stress has been shown to impair learning and memory in later life, but new research, published online in The FASEB Journal, suggests that improved nutrition may help offset the negative effects of this stress. 

- Specifically, using mice, scientists focused on essential micronutrients, including methionine, vitamins B6 and B12, and folic acid, none of which are made by the body and need to be ingested through diet. 

- However, stress-exposed mice from mothers that received the supplemented diet performed equally well as the control mice did.“The field of postnatal nutrition has sometimes taken a back seat to research on the maternal-fetal axis, but of course we cannot ever ignore either,” said Thoru Pederson, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal. 

- The nutrients tested were familiar ones, but the results speak for themselves.”Cold Homes Increase The Risk Of Severe Mental Health Problems – New StudyUniversity of Adelaide (Australia), October 31, 2022Concerns about fuel poverty and people not being able to heat their homes adequately are not new in the UK, but these worries have been heightened by significant increases in energy costs and the cost-of-living crisis. 

- But we know relatively little about the effects on mental health. 

- Our new research shows that living in a cold home is a significant mental health risk.Living in a cold home can affect your mental health in several ways. 

- And many people are just worn down by the drudgery of a whole winter of being uncomfortably cold.Using data from a large representative sample of adults in the UK, we followed people over many years and tracked the effect of being unable to keep your home warm on mental health.When people’s homes became cold, their risk of severe mental distress significantly increased. 

- For people who previously had no mental health problems, the odds of severe mental distress doubled when they had a cold home, while for those who had some (but not severe) mental health symptoms, the risk tripled . 

- We found these effects even after taking into account many other factors associated with mental health, including income.

- “Consuming green-colored vegetables or green pigment supplement such as chlorophyllin might help people with inflammatory bowel disease,” senior author Xiaofeng Zheng, PhD, of Sichuan University West China Hospital in Chengdu, China predicted.Current treatments for inflammatory bowel diseases include immunosuppressant medications and surgery, both of which are associated with potentially serious adverse effects. 

- “The study was designed to determine the effect of safe agents that are easily available to have a beneficial effect in inflammatory bowel disease,” commented report coauthor Stephen J. Pandol, MD, of Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.The team induced colitis in mice by administering dextran sulfate sodium. 

- They found that supplementing the animals’ diets with chlorophyllin or directly administering the compound suppressed intestinal inflammation and downregulated disease-associated autophagy in the intestine.“What we found in the study was that the agent used, chlorophyllin, would inhibit the inflammation and tissue damage that occurs in an experimental model of colitis,” Dr Pandol commented. 

- The results were promising in an experimental model, and those can justify a clinical trial.”Curcumin Prodrug Shows Promise As Cancer Treatment Without Toxic Side EffectsKyoto University (Japan), October 30, 2022Curcumin, the biologically active compound found in turmeric, has shown lots of promise in clinical cancer research. 

- While treatment is often considered futile in this highly lethal form of cancer, a new study indicates a turmeric extract could provide a reasonable chemotherapy alternative.Research published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Anticancer Research found liposomal curcumin was able to inhibit pancreatic cancer cell proliferation in vitro and when administered to mice three times a week for four weeks, it was able to suppress tumor growth when compared with control groups.Liposomal curcumin is curcumin delivered by encapsulation in liposomes, or a prepared carrier with a lipd (fat) layer. 

- “The therapeutic curcumin-based effects, with no limiting side-effects, suggest that liposomal curcumin may be beneficial in patients with pancreatic cancer.”One study published in the journal PLoS One found that curcumin has the power to inhibit the growth of esophageal cancer cell lines, while other research from UCLA actually found curcumin to decrease brain tumor size by a whopping 81%.Fermented foods and fiber may lower stress levels, says new studyAPC Microbiome Ireland & University College Cork, October 28, 2022When it comes to dealing with stress, we’re often told the best things we can do are exercise, make time for our favorite activities or try meditation or mindfulness.But the kinds of foods we eat may also be an effective way of dealing with stress, according to research published by me and other members of APC Microbiome Ireland. 

- Our latest study, now published in Molecular Psychiatry, has shown that eating more fermented foods and fiber daily for just four weeks had a significant effect on lowering perceived stress levels.The mechanisms underpinning the effect of diet on mental health are still not fully understood. 

- This is known as a “psychobiotic” diet, as it included foods that have been linked to better mental health.They were told they should aim to include 6–8 servings daily of fruits and vegetables high in prebiotic fibers (such as onions, leeks, cabbage, apples, bananas and oats), 5–8 servings of grains per day, and 3–4 servings of legumes per week. 

- Some of these chemicals have been linked to mental health, which could potentially explain why participants on the diet reported feeling less stressed.Sedentary lifestyle and sugary diet more detrimental to men, study findsUniversity of Missouri, October 27, 2022A new study from the University of Missouri School of Medicine is the first evidence in humans that short-term lifestyle changes can disrupt the response to insulin of blood vessels. 

- It’s also the first study to show men and women react differently to these changes.Vascular insulin resistance is a feature of obesity and type 2 diabetes that contributes to vascular disease. 

- The participants also increased their sugary beverage intake to six cans of soda per day.The results showed that only in men did the sedentary lifestyle and high sugar intake cause decreased insulin-stimulated leg blood flow and a drop in a protein called adropin, which regulates insulin sensitivity and is an important biomarker for cardiovascular disease.“These findings underscore a sex-related difference in the development of vascular insulin resistance induced by adopting a lifestyle high in sugar and low on exercise,” said Manrique-Acevedo.“To our knowledge, this is the first evidence in humans that vascular insulin resistance can be provoked by short-term adverse lifestyle changes, and it’s the first documentation of sex-related differences in the development of vascular insulin resistance in association with changes in adropin levels.”Spearmint can significantly improve memory, concentration, and brain functionSt Louis University School of Medicine,  October 25, 2022Around 64 percent of Americans start their day with a cup of coffee (or several). 

- And, many health article mention that this popular beverage can actually improve memory? 

- Even better, spearmint has also been found to improve memory, sharpen concentration and support overall brain health.Research shows spearmint dramatically improves brain function in older individualsThe benefits of spearmint are particularly beneficial for cognitive functioning. 

- It offers an enticing combination of relaxation as well as an almost immediate boosting of cognitive function.Two studies confirm and quantify the powers of spearmint’s ability to support brain health and boost memory. 

- They all showed dramatic improvements in spacial working memory as well as their sleep patterns.Other health benefits of spearmint include improved digestion and relief from sore throat, toothache, cramps, arthritis symptoms, headache, fatigue and the common cold. 

- Their uses in medical treatment date to the Compendium of Materia Medica, a book widely deemed the encyclopedia of traditional Chinese medicine written in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).Omega-3 fatty acid could boost IQ for preterm babiesSouth Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, October 27, 2022New research from SAHMRI has found a link between the omega-3 fatty acid known as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and increased IQ among children born prematurely.Preterm children are more likely to have lower IQ scores and cognitive impairments compared with term-born children.Dr. 

- At five years old, children in both groups underwent the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) IQ test.“On average, those in the DHA group scored 3.5 points higher on the IQ scale than those in the control group,” Dr. Gould said.“These very promising results suggest DHA has the potential to improve cognitive performance when administered via emulsion for infants born before 29 weeks’ gestation.”Crossword puzzles beat computer video games in slowing memory lossColumbia University Irving Medical Center & Duke University, October 27, 2022A new study by researchers from Columbia University and Duke University published in the journal NEJM Evidence shows that doing crossword puzzles has an advantage over computer video games for memory functioning in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.In a randomized, controlled trial, led by D.P. 

- Devanand, MD, professor of psychiatry and neurology at Columbia, with Murali Doraiswamy, MD, professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke, researchers determined that participants (average age 71) trained in doing web-based crossword puzzles demonstrated greater cognitive improvement than those who were trained on cognitive video games.“This is the first study to document both short-term and longer-term benefits for home-based crossword puzzles training compared to another intervention,” said Dr. Devanand, who oversees brain aging and mental health research at Columbia. 

- Crossword puzzles were superior on FAQ, a measure of daily functioning, at 78 weeks.Crossword puzzles were superior for participants at a later disease stage but both forms of training were equally effective in an earlier stage.Brain shrinkage (measured with MRI) was less for crossword puzzles at 78 weeks.“The benefits were seen not only in cognition but also in daily activities with indications of brain shrinkage on MRI that suggests that the effects are clinically meaningful,” Dr. Devanand said.The study also highlights the importance of engagement. 

- Based on remote electronic monitoring of computer use, participants at a later stage of impairment may have better engaged with the more familiar crossword puzzles than with computerized cognitive games.Atherosclerosis, ED, low vitamin D levels linkedGuizhou Medical University (China), October 24 2022.A study published in Frontiers in Endocrinology evaluated the associations between lower serum levels of vitamin D, erectile dysfunction (ED) and an increased risk of atherosclerosis.The investigation included 163 men aged 30 to 60 years who received physical examinations at the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University. 

- Because activating cold adaptation burns calories, improving the process be useful for more than the ability to tolerate cold environments.Feeling chirpy: Being around birds is linked to lasting mental health benefitsKing’s College London, October 27, 2022New research from King’s College London has found that seeing or hearing birds is associated with an improvement in mental well-being that can last up to eight hours.This improvement was also evident in people with a diagnosis of depression—the most common mental illness worldwide—indicating the potential role of birdlife in helping those with mental health conditions.Lead author Ryan Hammoud, Research Assistant at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN), King’s College London, said: “There is growing evidence on the mental health benefits of being around nature and we intuitively think that the presence of birdsong and birds would help lift our mood. 

- However, there is little research that has actually investigated the impact of birds on mental health in real-time and in a real environment.The study took place with 1,292 participants completing 26,856 assessments. 

- Participants were recruited worldwide.The app asked participants three times a day whether they could see or hear birds, followed by questions on mental well-being to enable researchers to establish an association between the two and to estimate how long this association lasted.Researchers showed that the links between birds and mental well-being were not explained by co-occurring environmental factors such the presence of trees, plants, or waterways.Our study provides an evidence base for creating and supporting biodiverse spaces that harbor birdlife, since this is strongly linked with our mental health. 

- In addition, the findings support the implementation of measures to increase opportunities for people to come across birdlife, particularly for those living with mental health conditions such as depression.”

- (13:25)Peanuts Linked to Lower Breast Cancer RiskWashington University in St. Louis & Harvard University, October 22, 2022Girls ages 9 to 15 who regularly ate peanut butter or nuts were 39 percent less likely to develop benign breast disease by age 30, according to a new study.Benign breast disease, although noncancerous, increases risk of breast cancer later in life.“These findings suggest that peanut butter could help reduce the risk of breast cancer in women,” says senior author Graham Colditz, professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine and associate director for cancer prevention and control at Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.Published in the journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, the findings are based on the health histories of 9,039 US girls enrolled in the Growing Up Today Study .When the study participants were 18 to 30 years old, they reported whether they had been diagnosed with benign breast disease that had been confirmed by breast biopsy.Participants who ate peanut butter or nuts two times each week were 39 percent less likely to have developed benign breast disease than those who never ate them.The study’s findings suggest that beans, lentils, soybeans, and corn also may help prevent benign breast disease, but consumption of these foods was much lower in these girls so the evidence was weaker.Past studies have linked peanut butter, nut, and vegetable fat consumption to a lower risk for benign breast disease. 

- The low-carbohydrate diet group also lost weight and had lower fasting glucose levels.“The key message is that a low-carbohydrate diet, if maintained, might be a useful approach for preventing and treating Type 2 diabetes, though more research is needed,” said lead author Kirsten Dorans, assistant professor of epidemiology at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.The study’s findings are especially important for those with prediabetes whose A1c levels are higher than normal but below levels that would be classified as diabetes. 

- Barak says that “the medical causes of autism are numerous and varied, and ultimately create the diverse autistic spectrum with which we are familiar. 

- Barak says that they “discovered that treatment in the oxygen-enriched pressure chamber reduces inflammation in the brain and leads to an increase in the expression of substances responsible for improving blood and oxygen supply to the brain, and therefore brain function. 

- In addition, we saw a decrease in the number of microglial cells, immune system cells that indicate inflammation, which is associated with autism.“To our surprise, the findings showed a significant improvement in the social behavior of the animal models of autism that underwent treatment in the pressure chamber compared to those in the control group, who were exposed to air at normal pressure, and without oxygen enrichment.”Study reveals connection between microbiome and autoimmune disordersUniversity of Calgary, October 23, 2022Published in Cell, a study by Santamaria and Kathy McCoy, PhD, from the University of Calgary’s Cumming School of Medicine (CSM) reveals a new mechanism in the gut microbiome that regulates pro- and anti-inflammatory cells. 

- “We found that a protein expressed by gut bacteria called Bacteroides works to prevent IBD by rapidly recruiting white blood cells to kill a cell of the immune system that is responsible for orchestrating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),” says McCoy. 

- Bhakdi Clip (7:27)Study shows inexpensive, readily available chemical (GABA) may limit impact of COVID-19University of California, Los Angeles, October 25, 2022Preclinical studies in mice that model human COVID-19 suggest that an inexpensive, readily available amino acid might limit the effects of the disease and provide a new off-the-shelf therapeutic option for infections with SARS-CoV-2 variants and perhaps future novel coronaviruses.A team led by researchers at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA report in Frontiers in Immunology that an amino acid called GABA, which is available over-the-counter in many countries, reduced disease severity, viral load in the lungs, and death rates in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. 

- In both cases, GABA treatment was effective when given just after infection or several days later near the peak of virus production. 

- The protective effects of GABA against two different types of coronaviruses suggest that GABA may provide a generalizable therapy to help treat diseases induced by new SARS-CoV-2 variants and novel beta-coronaviruses.Their previous studies showed that GABA administration protected mice from developing severe disease after infection with a mouse coronavirus called MHV-1. 

- “If our observations of the protective effects of GABA therapy in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice are confirmed in clinical trials, GABA could provide an off-the-shelf treatment to help ameliorate infections with SARS-CoV-2 variants. 

- Thus, GABA receptor activation had multiple beneficial effects in this mouse model that are also desirable for the treatment of COVID-19.Yoga as effective as traditional pulmonary rehab in patients with COPDAll India Institute of Medical Sciences (India), October 19, 2022Researchers from the Department of Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Disorders and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, studied the effects of yoga as a form of pulmonary rehabilitation on markers of inflammation in the body. 

- Results from this study showed yoga exercises provide improvements that are just as effective as traditional pulmonary rehabilitation methods in improving pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and indices of systemic inflammation.Sixty patients with COPD were randomly divided into two groups, one of which was taught yoga exercises while the other underwent a structured pulmonary rehabilitation program. 

- Results showed that yoga and pulmonary rehabilitation exercises resulted in similar improvements in pulmonary function, 6-minute walk distance, Borg scale, severity of dyspnea, quality of life, and levels of C-reactive protein after 12 weeks of training.“This study suggests yoga may be a cost-effective form of rehabilitation that is more convenient for patients,” said Mark J. Rosen, MD, Master FCCP, CHEST Medical Director. 

- Women who have PCOS also face a higher risk of developing other health problems, such as diabetes.“Our study is the first clinical trial to find resveratrol significantly lowers PCOS patients’ levels of testosterone as well as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), another hormone that the body can convert into testosterone,” said the study’s senior author, Antoni J. Duleba, MD, of the University of California, San Diego in La Jolla, CA. 

- “This nutritional supplement can help moderate the hormone imbalance that is one of the central features of PCOS.”Thirty women with PCOS completed the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at Poznan University of Medical Sciences in Poland. 

- The researchers also found the women who received resveratrol during the study became more responsive to the hormone insulin over the course of the study.Fluoridated water calcifies your arteries: studyUniversity of Zaragoza (Spain), October 22, 2014A major promoter of heart disease in the U.S. today could be a chemical that the government has been intentionally dumping into the water supply for decades on the premise that it prevents tooth decay. 

- Fluoride, according to a study published in the journal Toxicology, shows demonstrated cardiotoxic effects, which include the calcification and hardening of arteries.Researchers from the University of Zaragoza in Spain looked at the effects of water fluoridation on the progression of vascular calcification in renal (kidney) disease. 

- The team used real-world concentrations of fluoride as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for optimal oral health — 1.5 milligrams per liter (mg/L) — administering this amount to rats via water in the same way humans would receive it.It was observed that, for five days, the rats, all of whom had experimental chronic kidney disease (CKD), experienced calcification of their aortic smooth muscle cells. 

- The rats also experienced further declines in renal function as a result of exposure to fluoride, demonstrating the nephrotoxicity of this common water additive.“[F]luoridation of drinking water… dramatically increased the incipient aortic calcification observed in rats with experimental chronic kidney disease,” wrote the authors. 

- “[T]he WHO’s recommended concentrations in drinking water become nephrotoxic to CKD rats, thereby aggravating renal disease and making media vascular calcification significant.”Previous research, as noted in the new study, has confirmed that 90 percent or more of digested fluoride is absorbed through the intestines and distributed throughout the body to soft tissues, calcified structures and blood plasma. 

- But in those with renal disease, the kidneys are not up to the task of removing fluoride from the body, greatly amplifying both the calcification process and the advancement of renal failure.Lower magnesium levels linked with increased mortality risk during up to 40 years of follow-upJiao Tong University School of Medicine  (China), October 20 2022.In an article in the journal Clinical Nutrition, Xi Zhang of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and colleagues reported an association between decreased serum levels of magnesium and a greater risk of dying from any cause during a follow-up period of up to 40 years.The study included data from 14,343 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study.There were 9,012 deaths during a median follow-up of 28.6 years. 

- “Moreover, several small secondary prevention randomized trials have shown that oral magnesium supplementation improved endothelial function, reduced thrombosis, and increased cardiopulmonary function and left ventricular ejection fraction among cardiovascular disease patients.”“Our findings support the hypothesis that serum magnesium may be clinically useful for predicting long-term health outcomes and mortality in the general population,” they conclude.Anxiety Makes It Harder to Listen to Your IntuitionFreie Universität Berlin, Psychologische Hochschule Berlin, University of Basel,  October 19, 2022As an anxious person, I find the mantra “go with your gut” endlessly frustrating. 

- Tulsi Gabbard Speech LIVE | Tulsi Gabbard Accuses Joe Biden | US News Latest | English News LIVEPolyphenol consumption in adolescents is associated with better cardiovascular healthUniversity of Barcelona (Spain), October 24, 2022The consumption of polyphenols in adolescents is associated with a better cardiovascular health, according to a collaborative research study which includes the University of Barcelona.The study has been published in Scientific Reports. 

- Program (Integral Health) of 24 secondary education schools in Madrid and Barcelona.Polyphenols are bioactive compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties found in several plant-based foods, mainly in fruit, vegetables, nuts and olive oil. 

- To date, there were few studies on the intake of polyphenols in children and adolescents.“With the results of this study, we observed that a higher urinary polyphenol excretion is linearly associated with a higher cardiovascular health index in adolescents aged 11-14, specially in children. 

- This cardiovascular health index is defined by the criteria established by the American Heart Association (AHA), which considers seven variables: body mass index, physical activity, smoking, diet, blood pressure, total cholesterol and blood glucose,” says Professor Rosa M Lamuela, director of the Institute for Research in Nutrition and Food Safety of the University of BarcelonaNAC supplements may benefit cardiovascular health: Human dataUniversity of Marburg (Germany), October 16, 2022Four weeks of supplementation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may reduce levels of homocysteine and improve blood pressure, says a new analysis of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.A daily dose of 1.8 grams of NAC could lower homocysteine levels by about 12%, and may improve systolic and diastolic blood pressure, according to findings published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .Elevated levels of the amino acid homocysteine have been reported to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. 

- This has led some to point to the potential of the B-vitamins to reduce homocysteine levels and reduce the risk of CVD. 

- B vitamins are cofactors for enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism and therefore giving people vitamin B supplements is hypothesized to reduce homocysteine levels and therefore reduce cognitive impairment.However, clinical trials including participants at risk of, or already suffering from, cardiovascular disease have produced null results, with some experts arguing that short term B vitamin supplementation should not be expected to reverse the long-term development of heart disease.“Because recent analyses that controlled for confounders such as statins or folate fortification detected a benefit of folate/B-vitamins for stroke (22–24), homocysteine may conditionally be a therapeutic target,” wrote the authors of the new study, led by Prof Wulf Hildebrandt, formerly with the German Cancer Research Center and now at the University of Marburg (Germany).“Therefore, an alternative agent for (more) effective homocysteine lowering may be desirable, especially for conditions in which B-vitamins are ineffective [e.g., in renal disease] or if a reduction in homocysteine of >25% is intended.”There is a known link between homocysteine and NAC, and some studies have shown that NAC may reduce levels of the amino acid, but the data is somewhat mixed.Results showed that NAC supplementation significant decreased homocysteine levels by an average of 11.7% (versus 4.1% in the placebo groups), which cysteine levels increased by an average of 28.1% (versus 4% in the placebo groups). 

- However, significant decreases in diastolic BP were observed only for the hyperlipidemic men, and not for the normolipidemic men.Study: Late afternoon exercise helps control blood sugar, cholesterol and triglyceride levelsHuazhong University of Science and Technology (China), October 22, 2022Results of a study published in the journal Front Endocrinol show that exercising at around 4 to 6 p.m. helps to control blood sugar, cholesterol and triglyceride levels better than exercising in the morning, or around 9 to 11 a.m.For the study, researchers observed 12 healthy young men. 

- Their blood sugar levels after meals were also lower following afternoon exercise. 

- Most cell damage from high blood sugar is linked to a high rise in blood sugar at least one to two hours after eating a meal.The volunteers’ triglyceride levels were also lower after afternoon exercise. 

- Having a blood triglyceride level greater than 150 indicates that your blood sugar rises too high after meals and that you are already diabetic or prediabetic.Blood levels of the good high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were also higher after afternoon exercise.When triglycerides rise too high, you are at increased risk for clots. 

- Our results provide a foundation for future research in this domain, which can now be performed with a much more precise and relevant focus.”Living with others and community engagement are keys to reduced dementia riskUniversity of New South Wales (Australia), October 24, 2022Research published in The Lancet Healthy Longevity provides evidence to support that living with others, community group engagement and never feeling lonely are associated with slower cognitive decline.It is widely recognized that poor social connections such as small networks, infrequent interactions, and loneliness are modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline, with the 2020 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention estimating that tackling social isolation could prevent 4% of dementia cases worldwide.This research, led by UNSW Sydney’s Centre for Healthy Brain Aging (CHeBA), investigated a range of measures of social connectedness to discover which had the most robust findings in relation to risk reduction of cognitive decline—and dementia.“We looked at a range of measures of social connections, in approximately 40,000 people across 13 international studies,” says lead author Dr. Suraj Samtani, Postdoctoral Fellow and social health expert at CHeBA. 

- Pigments called carotenoids — which give red or orange hues to carrots, sweet potatoes and orange peppers, or deep greens to produce like spinach, broccoli and kale — may help ward off the age-linked vision ailment known as macular degeneration, researchers said.“I tell my patients that fruit and vegetable consumption are very important for eye health — this study validates that notion,” said Dr. Paul Bernstein, a professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences at the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the most common causes of vision loss, especially in the elderly. 

- Scientists have already linked a variety of factors to the condition including genetics, smoking and nutrition, said Bernstein, who was not involved in the new study. 

- However, treatment for AMD may be limited depending on the type of macular degeneration that a person develops, he said.In the new study, Wu’s team looked at data from health surveys that tracked people aged 50 and older — more than 63,000 women and almost 39,000 men -over a 25 year period. 

- Participants were all nurses and other health professionals. 

- (First 1 of 7 ) (start @ 0:17)Carotenoids linked to lower diabetesUtrecht University Medical Center (Netherlands), October 21, 2022A prospective study of 37,846 subjects links higher carotenoid consumption to a lower risk of diabetes.People who consume a diet high in antioxidant-rich carotenoids have a lower occurrence of diabetes, according to a new study. 

- The researchers linked higher intakes of beta and alpha carotene with lower risks of type 2 diabetes.The research analyzed data from validated food frequency questionnaires from 37,846 participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which followed subjects for a mean of 10 years. 

- Thirty-one percent of the subjects smoked.“This study shows that diets high in beta-carotene and alpha-carotene are associated with reduced type 2 diabetes in generally healthy men and women,” concluded the authors of the study, which appeared in the journal Nutrition, Metabolism & Cardiovascular Disease. 

- After three months, 54.4 percent of people who took melatonin had a 50 percent or greater reduction in frequency of headaches compared to 39.1 percent in the amitriptyline group and 20 percent in the placebo group.Study: Eating foods high in healthy fats helps fight off skin cancerUniversity Medical Center Groningen (Netherlands), October 21, 2022A study has found that foods rich in healthy fats can help protect against skin cancer and boost the effectiveness of immunotherapy among skin cancer patients. 

- The diet is popular because it is associated with amazing health benefits such as a longer lifespan and protection against cardiovascular diseases.For the study, researchers from the U.K. and UMCG tracked the diets of 91 patients with advanced melanoma. 

- The findings revealed that the patients following a Mediterranean diet responded better to ICIs and were also most likely to not get any worse a year later.According to the results of the study, whole grains and legumes in particular also helped reduce the likelihood of patients experiencing side effects from the immunotherapy drugs kike colitis or inflammation of the colon.Meanwhile, those who consumed a lot of red and processed meat experienced more side effects.Exercise Matters Regardless of Genetics When it Comes to LongevityUniversity of California San Diego, October 21, 2022A study from the University of California San Diego found that engaging in physical activity contributed to your longevity, regardless of genetic predispositions.This study of over 5,400 postmenopausal women aged 63 and up examined the role fitness habits play in longevity. 

- “Even if you aren’t likely to live long based on your genes, you can still extend your lifespan by engaging in positive lifestyle behaviors such as regular exercise and sitting less,” concluded senior author and assistant professor at UC San Diego, Aladdin H. Shadyab, Ph.D.The UC San Diego study sought to answer the question of whether this risk changes if the person is genetically predisposed to live a long life. 

- Exercise increased the likelihood to live longer regardless of the subject’s genetic profile, just as being sedentary increased their risk to die younger than would have otherwise been predicted based on their genes.When accounting for activity of the subjects and adjusting for variables like race, age, BMI, smoker vs. nonsmoker and overall health status the authors found:The highest quartile for light physical activity had a whopping 45% reduced risk of death compared to those in the lowest quartileThe highest quartile of moderate-to vigorous activity category had a 54% reduced risk of death vs. the lowestThe highest quartile for sedentary time doubled their risk of death compared to those with the lowest sedentary quartileThis association of activity and longevity carried through even with the genetic risk score taken into account, confirming that the benefit of exercise on longevity was present, regardless of genetics. 

- Shadyab emphasized the importance of these findings and physical activity’s impact on living longer, stating, “Even if your genes predispose you to a long life, remaining physically active is still important to achieve longevity.”Pesticide Free Organic Food Lowers Blood Cancer Risk by 86%Centre of Research in Epidemiology and Statistics (France), October 22, 2022Cutting out pesticides by eating only organic food could slash your cancer risk by up to 86 percent, a new study claims.The biggest impact was seen on non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma risk, which plummeted among those who shunned chemical-sprayed food, according to the survey of nearly 70,000 French adults.Overall, organic eaters were 25 percent less likely to develop any cancer, and their risks of skin and breast cancers dropped by a third.The health benefit was far greater for obese people, they found.However, the diet had no significant effect on bowel cancer – which is soaring in numbers globally – or prostate cancer.‘Our results indicate that higher organic food consumption is associated with a reduction in the risk of overall cancer,’ lead author Dr Julia Baudry of the Centre of Research in Epidemiology and Statistics Sorbonne, Paris said. 

- Factoring in known cancer risks, the proportion of participants in the top quartile for eating organic food who got certain cancers was a fraction compared to those in the bottom quartile.The most common was 459 breast cancers, followed by 180 prostate cancers, 135 skin cancers, 99 colorectal cancers, 47 non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and 15 other lymphomas.High organic food scores were inversely associated with the overall risk of cancer being 25 percent less for those of the top quartile compared to the bottom.WHO highlights high cost of physical inactivity in first-ever global reportWorld Health Organization, October 21, 2022Almost 500 million people will develop heart disease, obesity, diabetes or other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) attributable to physical inactivity, between 2020 and 2030, costing US$ 27 billion annually, if governments don’t take urgent action to encourage more physical activity among their populations.The Global status report on physical activity 2022, published by the World Health Organization, measures the extent to which governments are implementing recommendations to increase physical activity across all ages and abilities.Data from 194 countries show that overall, progress is slow and that countries need to accelerate the development and implementation of policies to increase levels of physical activity and thereby prevent disease and reduce burden on already overwhelmed health care systems.Less than 50% of countries have a national physical activity policy, of which less than 40% are operationalOnly 30% of countries have national physical activity guidelines for all age groupsWhile nearly all countries report a system for monitoring physical activity in adults, 75% of countries monitor physical activity among adolescents, and less than 30% monitor physical activity in children under 5 yearsIn policy areas that could encourage active and sustainable transport, only just over 40% of countries have road design standards that make walking and cycling safer.The economic burden of physical inactivity is significant and the cost of treating new cases of preventable non-communicable diseases (NCDs) will reach nearly US$ 300 billion by 2030, around US$ 27 billion annually.The report calls for countries to prioritize physical activity as key to improving health and tackling NCDs, integrate physical activity into all relevant policies, and develop tools, guidance and training to improve implementation. 

- – Clare Daly  (1:17)Clinical trial for nicotinamide riboside: Vitamin safely boosts levels of important cell metabolite linked to multiple health benefitsUniversity of Iowa Health Care, October 10, 2022In a clinical trial of nicotinamide riboside (NR), a newly discovered form of Vitamin B3, researchers have shown that the compound is safe for humans and increases levels of a cell metabolite that is critical for cellular energy production and protection against stress and DNA damage.Studies in mice have shown that boosting the levels of this cell metabolite — known as NAD+ — can produce multiple health benefits, including resistance to weight gain, improved control of blood sugar and cholesterol, reduced nerve damage, and longer lifespan. 

- Levels of NAD+ diminish with age, and it has been suggested that loss of this metabolite may play a role in age-related health decline. 

- Because the levels of supplementation in mice that produce beneficial effects are achievable in people, it appears than health benefits of NR will be translatable to humans safely.”Consumption of a bioactive compound from Neem plant could significantly suppress development of prostate cancerNational University of Singapore, September 29, 2022Oral administration of nimbolide, over 12 weeks shows reduction of prostate tumor size by up to 70 per cent and decrease in tumor metastasis by up to 50 per centA team of international researchers led by Associate Professor Gautam Sethi from the Department of Pharmacology at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS) has found that nimbolide, a bioactive terpenoid compound derived from Azadirachta indica or more commonly known as the neem plant or curry leaf common in throughout Indian cuisine, could reduce the size of prostate tumor by up to 70 per cent and suppress its spread or metastasis by half.In this research, we have demonstrated that nimbolide can inhibit tumor cell viability — a cellular process that directly affects the ability of a cell to proliferate, grow, divide, or repair damaged cell components — and induce programmed cell death in prostate cancer cells,” said Assoc Prof Sethi.The researchers observed that upon the 12 weeks of administering nimbolide, the size of prostate cancer tumor was reduced by as much as 70 per cent and its metastasis decreased by about 50 per cent, without exhibiting any significant adverse effects. 

- “We have found that nimbolide can substantially inhibit STAT3 activation and thereby abrogating the growth and metastasis of prostate tumor,” he added.Mindfulness training provides a natural high, study findsUniversity of Utah, October 20, 2022New research from the University of Utah finds that a mindfulness meditation practice can produce a healthy altered state of consciousness in the treatment of individuals with addictive behaviors. 

- The findings come from the largest neuroscience study to date on mindfulness as a treatment for addiction.The study, published in the journal Science Advances, provides new insight into the neurobiological mechanisms by which mindfulness treats addiction. 

- Study findings provide a promising, safe and accessible treatment option for the more than 9 million Americans misusing opioids. 

- Eric Garland is the lead author of the paper and is a distinguished professor and directs the University of Utah’s Center on Mindfulness and Integrative Health Intervention Development.Garland’s study builds on previous research measuring the positive effects of theta waves in the human brain. 

- Participants were randomly placed into either the control group that participated in supportive group psychotherapy or the experimental group taught to incorporate Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) into their daily lives.Participants showed more than twice as much frontal midline theta brain activity following treatment with MORE, whereas those in supportive therapy showed no increase in theta. 

- Garland explained that by achieving “tastes of self-transcendence” through meditation, mindfulness therapy boosted theta waves in the frontal lobes of the brain to help participants gain self-control over their addictive behaviors.Free radicals blamed for toxic buildup in Alzheimer’s brainsRutgers University, October 11, 2022.A study reported in Cell Death & Disease revealed a previously unknown mechanism that may contribute to traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease. 

- While a buildup of the protein amyloid-beta has been hypothesized to be the major driver of Alzheimer’s disease, the study suggests that another protein, after undergoing oxidation by free radicals, could be a causative factor.“Indeed, scientists have known for a long time that during aging or in neurodegenerative disease cells produce free radicals,” explained lead researcher Federico Sesti, who is a professor of neuroscience and cell biology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. 

- “Further, KCBB1 channels may not only contribute to Alzheimer’s but also to other conditions of stress as it was found in a recent study that they are formed following brain trauma.”Study: Maternal, paternal exercise affects metabolic health in offspringOhio State University, October 19, 2022A mouse study by Kristin Stanford, with The Ohio State University College of Medicine at the Wexner Medical Center, provides new ways to determine how maternal and paternal exercise improve metabolic health of offspring.This study used mice to evaluate how their lifestyles—eating fatty foods vs. healthy and exercising vs. not—affected the metabolites of their offspring.Metabolites are substances made or used when the body breaks down food, drugs or chemicals, or its own fat or muscle tissue. 

- This process, called metabolism, makes energy and the materials needed for growth, reproduction and maintaining health. 

- Metabolites can serve as disease markers, particularly for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.“Tissue metabolites contribute to overall metabolism, including glucose or fatty acid metabolism, and thus systemic metabolism. 

- We have previously shown that maternal and paternal exercise improve health of offspring. 

- Tissue and serum metabolites play a fundamental role in the health of an organism, but how parental exercise affects offspring tissue and serum metabolites has not yet been investigated. 

- This new data contributes to how maternal or paternal exercise could improve metabolism in offspring,” Stanford said.This study found that all forms of parental exercise improved whole-body glucose metabolism in offspring as adults, and metabolomics profiling of offspring serum, muscle, and liver reveal that parental exercise results in extensive effects across all classes of metabolites in all of these offspring tissues.Regular consumption of fried food before pregnancy increases risk of developing gestational diabetesKennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, October 10, 2022New research published in Diabetologia (the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes) shows that women who eat fried food regularly before conceiving are at increased risk of developing gestational diabetes during pregnancy.Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a complication that can arise during pregnancy, and is characterised by abnormally high blood glucose during the pregnancy (especially in the final 3 months). 

- Women who have GDM are more likely to later develop full blown type 2 diabetes.The authors included 21,079 singleton pregnancies from 15,027 women in the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II) cohort. 

- This may partly explain why we observed a stronger association of GDM risk with fried foods consumed away from home than fried foods consumed at home.”
Video:Interview with Dr. Rupert Sheldrake (41:21)Stomach cancer cells halted with whole tomato extractsSbarro Institute for Molecular Medicine at Temple University  October 10, 2022The Mediterranean diet has become regarded as highly beneficial to overall health, maintaining ideal weight and a reduced risk of cancer plus many other chronic disease conditions. 

- Then growth hormone secretion will be stimulated which in turn can affect glucose metabolismIncreasing green space could narrow lifespan gap between poorest and richest areasUniversity of Glasgow (Scotland), October 19, 2022Increasing the amount of natural (green and blue) space and private gardens has the potential to narrow the lifespan gap between those living in the most and least deprived areas, suggests research published online in the Journal of Epidemiology of Community Health.Each 10% increase in natural space is linked to a 7% fall in the incidence of early death among the under 65s, the findings indicate.It’s not clear if access to natural space might also be associated with differences in lifespan and protection against an earlier than expected death, so the researchers used the measure of “years of life lost,” or YLL for short, to try and find out.Natural space was defined as: woodland; scattered trees; scrub; marsh; heath; open water (inland or tidal); semi natural grassland; general natural areas, such as grass on sports pitches, roadside verges, and farmland; agriculture; hard bare ground, such as rocks, boulders, and cliffs; and soft bare ground, such as sand, soil, and foreshore.Areas with the highest income deprivation had the lowest average percentage cover of natural space and gardens (58.5%, 49–65%). 

- People living in these areas had the highest levels of ill health.The study found that every 10% increase in natural space cover was associated with a 7% fall in the incidence of premature death.Food for thought: Study finds link between depression and unhealthy dietsMacquarie University, October 18, 2022A Macquarie University study of 169 adults aged 17 to 35 found those eating a Western-style diet were more likely to have lower levels of kynurenic acid (KA)—a small molecule important to a number of bodily functions—and report higher levels of depression than those eating diets rich in fresh fruit and vegetables.Neuroscientist Dr. Edwin Lim and neuropsychologist Dr. Heather Francis published a paper on the findings of the study in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition.“Western-style diets high in fat, sugar and processed foods were already known to increase the risk of depression, but this is the first time a biological link involving the kynurenine pathway has been established,” Lim says.“People from the group eating an unhealthy diet had lower levels of KA and more severe symptoms of depression. 

- One of these important molecules is tryptophan—an essential amino acid that the body can’t make itself, that is found in foods like dairy products, poultry, bananas, oats, nuts and seeds.When tryptophan is broken down, it can produce either serotonin and melatonin—important for our mood and sleep—or it can be processed by the kynurenine pathway, which creates KA and other important metabolites linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.Lim says this is the first time anyone has been able to show that Western-style diet has an effect on the way that tryptophan is metabolized in otherwise healthy young people.“There is, however, a clear relationship between an increased risk of depression and eating an unhealthy diet that is high in fat, sugar and processed foods, giving us all the incentive to eat more fresh vegetables and fruit,” she says.Study finds Mediterranean diet more effective cure for acid reflux than medsFeinstein Institute for Medical Research & New York Medical College, October 8, 2022Sticking to a Mediterranean diet is just as effective at controlling reflux as medicines prescribed to millions of people each year, research suggests.Patients who ate primarily fish, vegetables and whole grains – and drank alkaline-heavy water – reported a greater reduction in their symptoms than those on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the small study found.Patients who ate fish, vegetables and whole grains reported a greater reduction in symptoms than those on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the study foundGastric, or oesophageal, reflux describes the traveling of stomach contents back up into the esophagus — a reversal of the normal flow. 

- People were also told to avoid known triggers of reflux, including coffee, tea, chocolate, fizzy drinks, greasy and fried food, spicy food, fatty food and alcohol.Patients on the plant-based diet also lost weight and needed fewer medicines for other conditions, including high blood pressure and high cholesterol.‘The results we found show we are heading in the right direction to treating reflux without medication.’Shorter sleep in later life linked to higher risk of multiple diseasesUniversity College London, October 19, 2022Getting less than five hours of sleep in mid-to-late life could be linked to an increased risk of developing at least two chronic diseases, finds a new study led by UCL researchers.The research, published in PLOS Medicine, analyzed the impact of sleep duration on the health of more than 7,000 men and women at the ages of 50, 60 and 70, from the Whitehall II cohort study.Researchers examined the relationship between how long each participant slept for, mortality and whether they had been diagnosed with two or more chronic diseases(multimorbidity)—such as heart disease, cancer or diabetes—over the course of 25 years.People who reported getting five hours of sleep or less at age 50 were 20% more likely to have been diagnosed with a chronic disease and 40% more likely to be diagnosed with two or more chronic diseases over 25 years, compared to people who slept for up to seven hours.Additionally, sleeping for five hours or less at the age of 50, 60, and 70 was linked to a 30% to 40% increased risk of multimorbidity when compared with those who slept for up to seven hours.Researchers also found that sleep duration of five hours or less at age 50 was associated with 25% increased risk of mortality over the 25 years of follow-up—which can mainly be explained by the fact that short sleep duration increases the risk of chronic disease(s) that in turn increase the risk of death.“Our findings show that short sleep duration is also associated with multimorbidity.As part of the study, researchers also assessed whether sleeping for a long duration, of nine hours or more, affected health outcomes. 

- There was no clear association between long sleep durations at age 50 and multimorbidity in healthy people.Study finds Mediterranean diet more effective cure for acid reflux than medsFeinstein Institute for Medical Research & New York Medical College, October 8, 2017Sticking to a Mediterranean diet is just as effective at controlling reflux as medicines prescribed to millions of people each year, research suggests.Patients who ate primarily fish, vegetables and whole grains – and drank alkaline-heavy water – reported a greater reduction in their symptoms than those on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the small study found.

- Blood pressure, arterial function, gut microbiome composition and other factors were assessed before and after the treatment period.At the end of the study, augmentation index and pulse wave velocity, which measure arterial stiffness, significantly improved among participants who received aronia in comparison with the placebo group. 

- The aronia-supplemented group also had a significant increase in microbiome species richness and abundance of species that produce butyrate, a compound that has a favorable effect in gut health.The researchers observed associations between plasma and urinary aronia-derived polyphenol metabolites, decreased arterial stiffness and various gut flora species. 

- “To our knowledge, this is the first time these species are shown to correlate with beneficial effects on arterial function,” they announced.“The present findings suggest that daily consumption of aronia berry extract led to improvements in arterial function in healthy middle-aged people, with a concomitant and related increase in potentially health-promoting bacterial taxa,” the authors concluded.Zinc enhances albumin’s protective role against Parkinson’s diseaseUniversity of Science and Technology, October 17, 2022Revealing zinc’s interaction with a critical transport protein underscores the need to study biological pathways under physiologically relevant conditions.Heavy metals in the body have long been thought to induce the aggregation of disease-linked proteins, but a KAUST study shows this is not always the case.It turns out that zinc ions tune the ability of human serum albumin (HSA), an abundant transport protein in the body, to better prevent α-synuclein from aggregating, a process directly linked to Parkinson’s disease.In unrealistically massive quantities, zinc tends to accelerate the aggregation of α-synuclein, a neuronal protein implicated in Parkinson’s disease. 

- In the study, published recently in Environmental Health, higher glyphosate levels were associated with lower birth weight and may also lead to higher neonatal intensive care unit admission risk.This is the second study the researchers have conducted with significant findings. 

- “We need to keep studying these herbicides long term to find out how they could be causing these issues and what we can do to prevent them.”Omega-3 supplements linked to younger biological age in older peopleUniversity of South Australia & University of Newcastle, October 13, 2022Supplements of omega-3s may slow cellular ageing in older people with mild cognitive impairment, according to results of a pilot randomized clinical trialDHA (docosahexaenoic acid) was associated with reduced shortening of telomeres, DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes that shorten as cells replicate and age, report researchers from Australia in Nutrition .The aging and lifespan of normal, healthy cells are linked to the so-called telomerase shortening mechanism, which limits cells to a fixed number of divisions. 

- Previous studies have also reported that telomeres are highly susceptible to oxidative stress.This is not the first time that omega-3s have been linked to reduced telomere shortening, with findings from a study by researchers from the University of California, San Francisco indicating that high blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids may slow cellular ageing in people with coronary heart disease (JAMA, Vol. 

- A relationship exists between self-perceived health and literacy, and draws on data from the international adult literacy and life skills survey (ALL).Self-perceived health can mean feeling pains, physical condition hampering everyday activities, fatigue, or emotional problems which affect social relationships. 

- “Other research shows that self-perceived health is closely related to actual well-being,” explains Lundetræ. 

- “So adults with low literacy skills, as a group, are likely to be in worse physical shape than those who can read well.”A perception of poor health increases among weak readers with age. 

- “So it’s natural that the relationship between weak reading skills and the perception of poor health rises with age. 

- That’s when you usually feel the effects of an unhealthy lifestyle or failing to look after yourself properly.”“Advice on nutrition, healthy diet and physical activity is increasingly communicated through newspaper and magazine articles and on the internet,” Lundetræ explains. 

- It’s conceivable that certain people miss out on important health advice because they read poorly and seldom.” How well people understand such written details could be crucial for how good they are at looking after their own health, Lundetræ observes. 

- Health-related text is often complicated. 

- That makes it difficult to grasp for poor readers.A general improvement in reading skills might accordingly give more people better health and, in the longer terms, have a beneficial effect on the cost of health services. 

- They must be written in a language which is not too technical or which uses too many words, and must communicate clearly and simply.Hair straightening chemicals associated with higher uterine cancer riskNational Institutes of Health, October 17, 2022Women who used chemical hair straightening products were at higher risk for uterine cancer compared to women who did not report using these products, according to a new study from the National Institutes of Health. 

- The researchers found no associations with uterine cancer for other hair products that the women reported using, including hair dyes, bleach, highlights, or perms.The study data includes 33,497 U.S. women ages 35-74 participating in the Sister Study, a study led by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, that seeks to identify risk factors for breast cancer and other health conditions.

- Researchers writing in open access Nutrition Journal pooled the results of 24 studies involving a total of more than 2000 participants, showing that some nutritional and herbal supplements can be effective, without the risk of serious side effects.The research was carried out by Shaheen Lakhan and Karen Vieira from the Global Neuroscience Initiative Foundation, a non-profit charity organization for the advancement of neurological and mental health patient welfare, education, and research, based in Los Angeles, USA. 

- Lakhan said, “Our review and summary of the literature on herbal remedies and dietary supplements for anxiety should aid mental health practitioners in advising their patients and provide insight for future research in this field. 

- Given that more than 60 percent of women report some daily walking, promoting walking as a healthy leisure-time activity could be an effective strategy for increasing physical activity among postmenopausal women,” said Alpa Patel, Ph.D., senior epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society (ACS) in Atlanta, G. “We were pleased to find that without any other recreational activity, just walking an average of one hour per day was associated with lower risk of breast cancer in these women.”“Current guidelines recommend that adults should strive to get at least 2.5 hours per week of moderate-intensity activity, or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity for overall health. 

- Among women who reported walking as their only activity, those who walked for seven hours or more per week had a 14 percent lower risk for breast cancer, compared with those who walked for three hours or less.Selenium may help fight pre-cancer cervical conditionArak University of Medical Sciences (Iran) , October 10, 2022Long-term consumption of selenium supplements may help reverse the progression of the ‘pre-cancer’ condition cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1), say researchers in Iran.Published in the British Journal of Nutrition, the study saw 58 women diagnosed with this low-grade CIN given either a placebo tablet or 200 micrograms of selenium supplements as selenium yeast daily for six months.After six months of supplementation they saw a regression in the condition and other beneficial metabolic effects.This included significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose levels, serum insulin levels and serum TAG levels and increased HDL-cholesterol levels.Cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a term used to describe changes in the squamous cells of the cervix. 

- The children with leukemia were each compared with other children randomly selected from the California birth registry who were matched by factors such as age, gender, ethnicity and maternal race.The study found an increased risk from X-rays for ALL, but not for AML or T-cell leukemia, and there was no association with age at first exposure.Furthermore, there was no increased risk associated with prenatal exposure to X-rays or maternal X-rays occurring before pregnancy.Surfing can prevent suicidal feelings in combat veterans with PTSDLoughborough University (UK) October 11, 2022Surfing can help improve well-being in combat veterans experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder and even avert suicidal feelings, according to a Loughborough University researcher.Nick Caddick said some of the veterans from Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, who took part in his study, revealed that surfing had not only improved their health and quality of life but saved their lives.It is the first time research has been conducted into a ‘Blue Gym’ – the sea – therapy that is becoming increasingly popular in Britain and America and is being seen as an alternative to the traditional medical option which can involve drugs.It is estimated that 6.9 per cent of UK combat soldiers will go on to suffer significant distress as a result of their service. 

- For the men, being active in this environment was an excellent example of ‘exercise is medicine’Nick spent time with them, both in and out of the water, observing how surfing gave them respite from PTSD symptoms like nightmares, flashbacks, severe depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. 

- But he said his research suggested that, if undertaken regularly, surfing was a powerful alternative to medical treatments which the veterans were sceptical about.“The veterans referred to it as a tremendous sense of freedom. 

- | Mark Steyn & Eva Vlaardingerbroek – Dutch Farmers (8:45)New Rule: A Unified Theory of Wokeness | Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO)Folic Acid Supplement Linked With Reduction in Suicide Attempts and Self-HarmUniversity Of Chicago, October 10, 2022Study finds folic acid treatment is associated with decreased risk of suicide attempt. 

- However, an eye-opening study recent conducted at the University of Chicago may change that.The study, published on in JAMA Psychiatry, used data from the health insurance claims of 866,586 patients. 

- It investigated the relationship between folic acid treatment and suicide attempts over a two-year period. 

- “This could potentially save tens of thousands of lives.”To investigate and further confirm the relationship between folic acid and suicide risk, Gibbons and his co-authors did this new study and focused specifically on folic acid, and accounted for many possible confounding factors, including age, sex, mental health diagnoses, other central nervous system drugs, conditions that affect folic acid metabolism, and more. 

- Each month of being prescribed folic acid was associated with an additional 5% decrease in risk of suicide attempt during the 24-month follow-up period of their study.It also occurred to the authors that maybe people who take vitamin supplements, in general, want to improve their health and would thus be less likely to attempt suicide. 

- The researchers say their finding could help improve treatment for esophageal cancer and even provide some insight into how it might be prevented. 

- Pan pointed out that many cancer patients have a zinc deficiency.It’s a significant discovery; esophageal cancer is now the sixth-leading cause of cancer death in humans globally, and the average five-year survival rate for those with the disease is less than 20 percent.Zinc deficiency is a serious problem. 

- Zinc is also important for immune function and proper wound healing.According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), adult men need 11 milligrams per day, while women need 8 milligrams. 

- It’s important not to go overboard, however; the NIH reports that zinc toxicity can cause adverse health effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and nausea.Listen! 

- Before and after hearing the sound clips, the participants filled in questionnaires assessing their mental health and performed cognitive tests.The present study suggests that listening to birdsong reduces anxiety and paranoia in healthy participants. 

- This way, as researcher Alberto Ribes Navarro argues, “we have been able to prove that the expression of proteins required for the proper functioning of insulin (the IRS) decreases in neuroinflammatory situations induced by a high-fat diet.” “With the addition of abscisic acid to the high-fat diet it is possible to recover the expression of these genes, even reaching normal levels”, he adds.With a high-fat diet they noticed alterations to cognitive functions, which were also recovered with the vegetable hormone treatment.Diets High in Processed Fiber May Increase Cancer RiskUniversity Of Toledo, October 13, 2022The study found that men who had high processed fiber intake and high blood bile acid levels had a 40% higher risk of liver cancer.Fiber-enriched foods are often consumed by many individuals to promote weight loss and fend against chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes. 

- Inulin is a refined, plant-based fermentable fiber that is sold in supermarkets as a health-promoting prebiotic. 

- Insoluble fibers pass through the digestive system unchanged.Intriguingly, researchers found high total fiber intake reduced the risk of liver cancer by 29% in those whose serum bile acid levels were in the lowest quartile of their sample.However, in men whose blood bile acid levels placed them in the top quarter of the sample, high fiber intake conferred a 40% increased risk of liver cancer.What kinds of exercise can boost long-term memory?Georgia Institute of Technology October 5, 2022Think that improving your memory is all brain training and omega-3 supplements? 

- However, the findings of the new study – published in the journal Acta Psychologica – demonstrate that a similar memory boost can be achieved in a much shorter period.“Our study indicates that people don’t have to dedicate large amounts of time to give their brain a boost,” says Lisa Weinberg who led the project.As well as looking at aerobic exercise, Weinberg’s team also examined how resistance exercise – weightlifting, push-ups and sit-ups – might affect memory.The team recruited 46 participants (29 women and 17 men), who were randomly assigned into two groups. 

- The participants were asked to try and remember as many of them as they could.Next, the participants were randomized into “active” and “passive” groups and seated at leg extension resistance exercise machines. 

- "What we discovered was when lupus was triggered by crystalline silica, a toxic mineral also known as quartz that's linked to human autoimmunity, DHA blocked the activation of the disease," said Melissa Bates, one of the study's lead authors in MSU's Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition and the Institute of Integrative Toxicology.The preclinical study looked at the effect of DHA on lupus lesions in the lungs and kidneys of female mice that were already genetically predisposed to the disease. 

- "Lupus is considered a genetic disease and is triggered not only by inhaling crystalline silica toxicants, but also by other environmental factors such as sun exposure. 

- Lupus is the body's immune system attacking itself and it can damage any part of the body including skin, joints and organs.Although it's still unknown exactly why DHA is able to prevent the onset of lupus, the researchers said this study provides scientists with a better model for looking at just how much DHA is needed to ward off the environmental trigger of the disease.According to Harkema, the DHA could be changing the way cells, also known as macrophages, react to the silica in the lungs and somehow alter the immune system's response. 

- "It can suppress many of the disease's signaling pathways, which current drugs on the market now try to target and treat. 

- “The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether the intake of vitamin D supplements (in the form of a vitamin D preparation or as part of a multivitamin product) is associated with reduced all-cause and cause-specific mortality including cancer mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and respiratory disease mortality in the large UK Biobank, a nationwide, population-based cohort from the United Kingdom.”The researchers analyzed information from 445,601 UK Biobank participants. 

- Regular vitamin D use was associated with 11% lower risk of dying from cancer and a 29% lower risk of mortality from respiratory disease.“This large study suggests that in the real world, the efficacy of vitamin D supplements in reducing mortality may be at least as good as observed in randomized clinical trials,” the authors concluded.What you eat could contribute to your menstrual crampsNorth American Menopause Society, October 12, 2022Despite the fact that menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea) is the leading cause of school absences for adolescent girls, few girls seek treatment. 

- Learning about different foods that increase and decrease inflammation, which subsequently increase or reduce menstrual pain, revealed that diet is one of the many contributors to health outcomes that is often overlooked. 

- I am hopeful that this research can help those who menstruate reduce the pain they experience and shed light on the importance of holistic treatment options,” says Serah Sannoh, lead author of the poster presentation from Rutgers University.“Since menstrual pain is a leading cause of school absenteeism for adolescent girls, it’s important to explore options that can minimize the pain. 

- Something like diet modification could be a relatively simple solution that could provide substantial relief for them,” said Dr. Stephanie Faubion, NAMS medical director.Free radicals blamed for toxic buildup in Alzheimer’s brainsRutgers University, October 10, 2022.A study reported in Cell Death & Disease revealed a previously unknown mechanism that may contribute to traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease. 

- While a buildup of the protein amyloid-beta has been hypothesized to be the major driver of Alzheimer’s disease, the study suggests that another protein, after undergoing oxidation by free radicals, could be a causative factor. 

- "Indeed, scientists have known for a long time that during aging or in neurodegenerative disease cells produce free radicals," explained lead researcher Federico Sesti, who is a professor of neuroscience and cell biology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. 

- "This paper focuses on a topic that has not drawn significant attention but, nonetheless, has important health implications," says Domenico Grasso, PhD, Editor-in-Chief of Environmental Engineering Science and Provost, University of Delaware.Using more social media increases depression risk for all personality types, study saysUniversity of Arkansas, October 11, 2022Public policy and education researchers found that higher social media exposure may contribute to depression, regardless of personality traits.In their recent study, high neuroticism was associated with an increased risk of developing depression within six months.On the other hand, low agreeableness was associated with a greater depression risk within that period.The study’s authors suggest that interventions should encourage reduced social media use for all personality types, especially high neuroticism, and low agreeableness.Experts have found evidence that suggests that increased social media use (SMU) may increase the risk of developing depression for certain personality characteristics, as the study showed that people low in conscientiousness with high SMU were more likely to perceive social isolation.A new study led by University of Arkansas researchers further explores how personality traits may influence the development of SMU-related depression.

- Few treatment options are currently available.The team of scientists from University of London and Kingston University London used a simple, single-celled amoeba to identify that naringenin regulates the PKD2 protein responsible for polycystic kidney disease and as a result, blocks formation of cysts.To test how this discovery could apply in treatments, the team used a mammalian kidney cell-line, and triggered the formation of cysts in these cells. 

- They were then able to block the formation of the cysts by adding naringenin and saw that when levels of the PKD2 protein were reduced in the kidney cells, so was the block in cyst formation, confirming that the effect was connected.“Indeed, this study provides a good example of how chemicals identified in plants can help us develop new drugs for the treatment of disease,” added Professor Debbie Baines from St George’s, University of London.Medical cannabis treats cancer and boosts the immune system, say scientists after reviewing more than 100 studiesRostock University Medical Center (Germany), October 1, 2022A review of over 100 studies has shown that cannabis really is medicinal.

- This is characterised by factors such as abdominal obesity, inflammation and diabetes, that are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.Stevia contains other compounds, such as phytochemicals, that provide beneficial properties to health.Theses include: diterpenes, labdabos, triterpenes, stigmasterol, tannins, ascorbic acid, alkaloids, steroids, saponins, flavonoids, b-carotene, chromium, cobalt, magnesium, iron, potassium, phosphorus, riboflavin, thiamine, tin, zinc, apigenin, austroinilina, avicularin, b-sitosterol, caffeic acid, campesterol, caryophyllene, centaureidin, chlorogenic acid, chlorophyll, kaempferol, luteolin and quercetin.The authors identify three separate rat or mice studies in which orally administered stevia for a period of between three and nine weeks led to a weight reduction.One study looking for sucrose replacement in beverages found that that satiety levels of SR, aspartame, and saccharose were similar among each other but stevia reduced the glucose and postprandial insulin levels, write the authors.Other human and animal studies identified stevia as beneficial in lowering blood pressure.

- In competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, MG effectively blocked the spike S1 RBD: ACE2 receptor molecular binding, and investigations using the BLItz system and in silico modeling revealed that MG has high affinity for both proteins.Finally, we confirmed that MG inhibits the entry of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus and a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, suggesting that MG might be a promising therapeutic candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 binding to the cell surface during early infection.Positive childhood experiences of blue spaces linked to better adult well-beingSapienza University (Italy) & University of Exeter (UK), October 10, 2022New research based on data from 18 countries concludes that adults with better mental health are more likely to report having spent time playing in and around coastal and inland waters, such as rivers and lakes (also known collectively as blue spaces) as children. 

- The finding was replicated in each of the countries studied.Mounting evidence shows that spending time in and around green spaces such as parks and woodlands in adulthood is associated with stress reduction and better mental health. 

- However, we know far less about the benefits of blue spaces, or the role childhood contact has in these relationships in later life.The research, published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, found that individuals who recalled more childhood blue space experiences tended to place greater intrinsic value on natural settings in general, and to visit them more often as adults – each of which, in turn, were associated with better mental wellbeing in adulthood.Valeria Vitale, Lead author at Sapienza University of Rome, said: “In the context of an increasingly technological and industrialized world, it’s important to understand how childhood nature experiences relate to wellbeing in later life.“Our findings suggest that building familiarity and confidence in and around blue spaces during childhood may stimulate an inherent joy of nature and encourage people to seek out recreational nature experiences, with beneficial consequences for adult mental health.”New survey: 91% of parents say their family is less stressed when they eat togetherAmerican Heart Association & John Hopkins University, October 10, 2022Survey Highlights:91% of parents notice their family is less stressed when they share family meals together.65% of surveyed adults say they are at least somewhat stressed, and more than a quarter (27%) are very or extremely stressed.84% of adults wish they could share a meal together more often.Overall, respondents reported eating alone about half of the time.Stress reduction, connecting with other people and taking time to slow down are identified as top benefits of mealtime.Of the 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide surveyed in September 2022 for the American Heart Association’s Healthy for GoodTM movement by Wakefield Research, the vast majority (84%) say they wish they could share a meal more often with loved ones, and nearly all parents report lower levels of stress among their family when they regularly connect over a meal.“Sharing meals with others is a great way to reduces stress, boost self-esteem and improve social connection, particularly for kids,” said Erin Michos, M.D, M.H.S, American Heart Association volunteer, associate director of preventive cardiology at Johns Hopkins . 

- “Chronic, constant stress can also increase your lifetime risk of heart disease and stroke, so it is important for people to find ways to reduce and manage stress as much as possible, as soon as possible.“Connecting with friends, family, coworkers and neighbors benefits people beyond stress relief. 

- Overall, respondents reported eating alone about half of the time.Study says zinc can halt the growth of cancer cellsUniversity of Texas at Arlington, September 28, 2022Zinc supplements can significantly inhibit the proliferation of esophageal cancer cells, according to a new study co-authored by a University of Texas at Arlington researcher.Previous studies had shown that zinc is essential for maintaining human health and protects the esophagus from cancer. 

- It can boost attention, awareness, and emotional health – faculties that decline with dementia.French participants assigned to an 18-month course did better than those given English lessons instead to keep their brains busy.“Meditation was superior to non-native language training on changing a global composite score and two of its subscores reflecting attention regulation and socio-emotional capacities,” says corresponding author Dr. Gael Chetelat from Caen-Normandy University in a statement, according to SWNS.“The attention regulation subscore increased after meditation only,” Dr. Chetelat tells SWNS. 

- Additionally, eight recipes were introduced to the participants using quinoa substitutions.At the beginning of the study most of the participants had an overweight profile, and hypertension, 45% had high blood lipids, and 33% had one or more close family members with disease. 

- Dietary proteins also enhance the building of lean muscle during weight loss which also helps to expend more energy and improve the overall body composition.Mediterranean diet improves immunotherapy response rates and progression-free survival in advanced melanoma, new study suggestsEating a Mediterranean diet, rich in fibre, mono-unsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols, has been associated with improved immunotherapy response rates and progression-free survival in advanced melanoma patients.University Medical Center Groningen (Netherlands), October 9, 2022Eating a Mediterranean diet, rich in fibre, mono-unsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols, has been associated with improved immunotherapy response rates and progression-free survival in advanced melanoma patients, a new study has found.1Experts anticipate that the diet will play an important role in the success of immunotherapy and trials are being expanded to investigate outcomes for different tumour types, including digestive cancers.A Mediterranean diet, containing mono-and polyunsaturated fats from olive oil, nuts and fish, polyphenols and fibre from vegetables, fruit, and wholegrains, was significantly associated with an improved response to immunotherapy drugs called Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs). 

- In contrast, red and processed meat was associated with a higher probability of immune-related side effects.Music practice can sharpen the brainUniversity of St Andrews (Scotland) October 1, 2022A new study by researchers at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland concludes that people who practice playing musical instruments have sharper brains because they pick up mistakes in their performance and fix them more quickly than other people.Writing about their work in a recent issue of the journal Neuropsychologia, psychologist Doctor Ines Jentzsch and colleagues suggest playing music may help guard against mental decline, either through age or disease.“Our study shows that even moderate levels of musical activity can benefit brain functioning.” For their study, the researchers compared the mental performance of musicians versus non-musicians as they challenged them to complete simple conflict tasks.There were 36 young adult participants in total, divided into four groups of 8 to 10, according to the number of accumulated hours of practicing a musical instrument over their lifetime (from “high,” over 5,000 hours, through “intermediate,” 2,000 to 5,000 hours and “low,” between 200 and 2,000 hours, to “no,” under 200 hours).The researchers tested each participant’s mental ability in a single session that lasted about 2 hours. 

- During the session, they measured the participant’s reaction times to the simple mental tasks and also took various physiological measurements.Their results show that the amount of musical practice was positively linked to response speed – the more-practiced musicians responded faster than those with little or no musical training, with no loss in accuracy.“This result suggests that higher levels of musical training might result in more efficient information processing in general […] and confirms earlier reports indicating a positive link between mental speed and musical ability,” write the authors.However, what this study particularly highlights is that more hours of musical practice were also linked with “better engagement of cognitive control processes,” which came through in more efficient error and conflict detection, and reduced levels of post-error interference and post-conflict adjustments.In other words, the more practice hours musicians had accumulated, the faster their reaction times in completing mental challenges, the better they were able to recognize and correct mistakes, and the less likely they were to go back and adjust their responses when they made mistakes.“The research suggests that musical activity could be used as an effective intervention to slow, stop or even reverse age- or illness-related decline in mental functioning.”3 Weeks Of Vitamin C Supplements Reduces Inflammation In Cystic Fibrosis PatientsOregon State University, October 6, 2022Cystic fibrosis, being the aggressive disease that it is, often presents new clinical obstacles tied to treatment. 

- Now, a new study by Oregon State University researchers may help improve patient outcomes, revealing that CF patients who take vitamin C supplements can help increase their uptake of vitamin E, which reduces inflammation.“Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that is associated with increased inflammation, and like many inflammatory diseases, it comes with a large amount of oxidative stress,” says Maret Traber of OSU’s Linus Pauling Institute in a university release.Traber also notes that CF patients have difficulty absorbing fat, limiting their body’s ability to use fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin E. This generally means that this patient population has to take in more fat than an average person to break even. 

- This is the first study to show a direct causative link in an animal model between obesity and risk of this deadly cancer.Cancer of the pancreas (scientifically known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or PaCa) is one of the most deadly forms of the disease in humans.

- These may have specific effects on metabolism, causing organ damage or disease. 

- The analysis showed that the methylation of 28 DNA segments changed a number of important metabolic processes.In the relevant DNA regions there were also already known disease-related genes: for example, the TXNIP gene that regulates glucose metabolism and is associated with the development of diabetes mellitus. 

- The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between exposure to fluoridated water and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) prevalence among children and adolescents in the United States.Methods: Data on ADHD prevalence among 4-17 year olds collected in 2003, 2007 and 2011 as part of the National Survey of Children’s Health, and state water fluoridation prevalence from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collected between 1992 and 2008 were utilized.Results: State prevalence of artificial water fluoridation in 1992 significantly positively predicted state prevalence of ADHD in 2003, 2007 and 2011, even after controlling for socioeconomic status. 

- Professor Sucharit Bhakdi, M.D – 10:00Study links omega-3s to improved brain structure, cognition at midlifeUniversity of Texas Health Science Center, October 5, 2022Eating cold-water fish and other sources of omega-3 fatty acids may preserve brain health and enhance cognition in middle age, new evidence indicates.Having at least some omega-3s in red blood cells was associated with better brain structure and cognitive function among healthy study volunteers in their 40s and 50s, according to research published in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.“Studies have looked at this association in older populations. 

- Researchers also studied the effect of omega-3 red blood cell concentrations in volunteers who carried APOE4, a genetic variation linked to higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.The study of 2,183 dementia- and stroke-free participants found that:Higher omega-3 index was associated with larger hippocampal volumes. 

- The hippocampus, a structure in the brain, plays a major role in learning and memory.Consuming more omega-3s was associated with better abstract reasoning, or the ability to understand complex concepts using logical thinking.APOE4 carriers with a higher omega-3 index had less small-vessel disease. 

- The APOE4 gene is associated with cardiovascular disease and vascular dementia.“Omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA are key micronutrients that enhance and protect the brain,” said study coauthor Debora Melo van Lent, PhD, postdoctoral research fellow at the Biggs Institute. 

- More studies in this age group are needed.”Multiple health benefits of b-type procyanidin-rich foods like chocolate and apples consumed in right amountsShibaura Institute of Technology (Japan), October 5, 2022B-type procyanidins, made of catechin oligomers, are a class of polyphenols found abundantly in foods like cocoa, apples, grape seeds, and red wine. 

- Their article has been published in Frontiers of Nutrition .The researchers noted that a single oral administration of an optimal dose of cocoa flavanol temporarily increased the blood pressure and heart rate in rats. 

- These participants were able to tame their negative emotions just as well as participants who were naturally mindful.“Our findings not only demonstrate that meditation improves emotional health, but that people can acquire these benefits regardless of their ‘natural’ ability to be mindful,” said Yanli Lin, an MSU graduate student and lead investigator of the study. 

- Interestingly, the people who viewed the photos “mindfully” showed no better ability to keep their negative emotions in check.This suggests that for non-meditators, the emotional benefits of mindfulness might be better achieved through meditation, rather than “forcing it” as a state of mind, said Moser, MSU associate professor of clinical psychology and co-author of the study.A mother’s ultra-processed food intake may be linked to obesity risk in her childrenMassachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, October 5, 2022A mother’s consumption of ultra-processed foods appears to be linked to an increased risk of overweight or obesity in her offspring, irrespective of other lifestyle risk factors, suggests a U.S. study published by The BMJ today.The researchers that mothers might benefit from limiting their intake of ultra-processed foods, that dietary guidelines should be refined, and financial and social barriers removed to improve nutrition for women of childbearing age and reduce childhood obesity.Researchers drew on data for 19,958 children born to 14,553 mothers (45% boys, aged 7-17 years at study enrollment) from the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II) and the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS I and II) in the United States.The results show that a mother’s ultra-processed food consumption was associated with an increased risk of overweight or obesity in her offspring. 

- Each group participated for 6 weeks and continued to self-report their experiences for 72 days after the treatment. 

- The reishi mushroom group experienced pain reduction by up to 30%, which is significant.They also reported getting better sleep, were happier and gained aerobic endurance and body flexibility.Time-restricted eating improves health of firefightersSalk Institute, October 3, 2022In collaboration with the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department, scientists from the Salk Institute and UC San Diego Health conducted a clinical trial and found that time-restricted eating improved measures of health and well-being in firefighters. 

- The lifestyle intervention only required the firefighters to eat during a 10-hour window and did not involve skipping meals.The new findings, published in Cell Metabolism may also have implications for shift workers, such as military personnel; health care, food service, and transportation professionals; telecommunications staff; and new parents, whose schedules often mimic shift work when caring for a new baby.“Doctors and researchers are always thinking about the magic pill that can cure or reduce disease. 

- Disruptions to these cycles, which can occur with shift work, can impact health, leading to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.In this clinical trial, 150 firefighters from the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department used the myCircadianClock app on their phones to track their eating for three months. 

- Both groups were encouraged to follow a Mediterranean diet, which is known to have health benefits. 

- The study included both individuals who were healthy and those who were overweight or who had health conditions such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, and/or blood glucose.The researchers found that time-restricted eating within a 10-hour eating window was feasible without adverse effects and helped the firefighters significantly decrease their VLDL (“bad”) cholesterol size by 1.34 nanometers (small VLDL is less likely to block arteries), improve their mental health, and reduce their alcohol intake by roughly three drinks per week. 

- The researchers concluded that time-restricted eating may provide even greater benefit for those at risk for cardiometabolic disease and other chronic diseases.

- Graham Colditz, of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and colleagues found that girls aged 9 to 15 who ate peanut butter and nuts twice a week were 39% less likely to develop benign breast disease by the age of 30 than girls who did not.Benign breast disease includes lumps or tender spots that turn out to be fibrous tissue and/or cysts, as well as other conditions like hyperplasia, an overgrowth of the cells that line the ducts in the glandular breast tissue. 

- Although benign breast disease is not cancerous, it can raise the risk of developing breast cancer later in life.For their study, he and his colleagues looked at health data on over 9,000 American schoolgirls recruited to The Growing Up Today Study. 

- The data also included reports from the girls between when they were 18 to 30 years old, that indicated whether they had ever been diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed benign breast disease.When they compared the two sets of data, the researchers found that participants who had eaten peanut butter or nuts twice a week were 39% less likely than peers who never ate those foods to receive a diagnosis for benign breast disease.The data suggest pulse foods – soy and other beans and lentils – and corn may also be linked to reduced risk of benign breast disease, but because they did not feature as much in the diets of these girls, the evidence was not so strong.And they concluded that “consumption of vegetable protein, fat, peanut butter, or nuts by older girls may help reduce their risk of BBD [benign breast disease] as young women.”Pine bark extracts may help curb age-related muscle loss; StudyD’Annunzio University (Italy), September 28, 2022Supplements containing the French maritime pine bark extract Pycnogenol may help stabilize muscle loss, support muscular function, and boosts daily muscle endurance, says a new study.Data from a study with 64 healthy seniors aged 70-78 indicated that 150 mg per day of Pycnogenol may improve muscle function and endurance in a range of everyday activities, from carrying items to climbing stairs and walking.Results published in Minerva Ortopedica e Traumatologica also indicated that supplementation with the pine bark was associated with a reduction in oxidative stress of 14%. 

- Oxidative stress is reportedly a common measurement of sarcopenia which prevents the body from normal detoxifying and repair.“Supplementation with Pycnogenol – suppressing the excess in oxidative stress and controlling muscular pain and fatigue – possibly in association with some specific protein and vitamins supplementation, may produce faster muscular replacement and muscular remodeling improving physical functions and fitness. 

- Strength declines as well, at a rate of 1.5% per year beginning at 50 years and accelerating to 3% after the age of 60.Results showed that the pine bark group experienced greater muscular function and endurance in daily tasks such as carrying items (4-5 lbs) (71% improvement versus 23% in the control group), climbing stairs (52 % improvement versus 20% in the control ground) and distance walked (38% improvement versus 17% in the control group).Supplementation with Pycnogenol was also associated with reduced proteinuria – the presence of protein in urine which, with normal kidney function, can indicate waste from muscle erosion – by 40%.In addition, individuals who took the pine bark extract supplements demonstrated improved general fitness scores by more than 46% in comparison with the control group.Study links prenatal phthalate exposure to reduced childhood lung functionBarcelona Institute for Global Health, October 3, 2022A study led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) has found that exposure to phthalates in the womb is associated with reduced lung function during childhood. 

- Phthalates act as endocrine disruptors and have been associated with numerous developmental and reproductive health problems.“Research has consistently found that gestational phthalate exposure is associated with increased risk of childhood asthma, but the evidence on its possible association with lung function is scarce and unclear,” explained ISGlobal researcher Magda Bosch de Basea, lead author of the study.The study included 641 mother-child pairs from the INMA Project birth cohorts in Sabadell and Gipuzkoa. 

- Maintaining a healthy blood pressure level looks to protect thinking skills, study authors say.“Our findings suggest that high blood pressure causes faster cognitive decline, and that taking hypertension medication slows the pace of that decline,” says lead study author Deborah Levine, M.D., M.P.H., director of the University of Michigan’s Cognitive Health Services Research Program and a professor of internal medicine at the U-M’s academic medical center, in a media release.Researchers examined changes in the thinking and memory abilities among a group of adults (18+) who took part in six long-term studies conducted over the past five decades.

- Capsaicin in chili peppers may be what protects health, Qi says. 

- It reduces risk of obesity, offers antibacterial properties, and helps protect against diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other conditions. 

- Thus, larger trials are needed, including an investigation of whether the observed effects of a weighted blanket on melatonin are sustained over longer periods,” says senior author Christian Benedict, Associate Professor of Pharmacology at the Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences at Uppsala University.Clinical Trial: Vegetable Extract may Treat Autism Better than DrugsHarvard Medical School, September 30, 2022A recent clinical trial has shown that one vegetable extract may have astounding positive effects on those with autism – broccoli extract.Along with an extensive Autism Spectrum Disease research database at GMI, there is evidence suggesting that broccoli extract (along with avoiding heavy metals, minimizing glyphosate exposure, and eradicating the diet of gluten) shows promise in improving ASD.The active ingredient in broccoli that seems to help is called sulforaphane, a molecule found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts.A groundbreaking study published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA titled, “Sulforaphane treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD),” found that a broccoli sprout extract significantly improved the behavior of boys and men (those who most often suffer from autism). 

- Sulforaphane was selected, in part, because its physiological effects are well characterized and ideal for those with ASD:“Dietary sulforaphane, of recognized low toxicity, was selected for its capacity to reverse abnormalities that have been associated with ASD, including oxidative stress and lower antioxidant capacity, depressed glutathione synthesis, reduced mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, increased lipid peroxidation, and neuroinflammmation.”The placebo-controlled, randomized pilot study of 44 males, ages 13-27, showed that after 18 weeks of treatment with a sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout extract, 46% had noticeable improvements in social interactions and 42% has improvements in verbal communication. 

- More than half of all participants also showed a decrease in irritability, hyperactivity, and repetitive movements.Of note, once treatment with broccoli extract stopped, most of the behaviors associated with autism returned.The dosing schedule was determined by body weight:· 100 lbs or less: one capsule containing 50 µmol (232 mg) of sulforaphane-rich broccoli extract was given daily· 101–199 lbs, 100 µmol (two capsules of 232 mg each) of sulforaphane-rich broccoli extract was given daily· More than 200 lbs: 150 µmol (three capsules of 232 mg each) of sulforaphane-rich broccoli extract was given dailySocial media use linked to developing depression regardless of personalityUniversity of Arkansas, October 3, 2022Researchers in public policy and education recently found that young adults who use more social media are significantly more likely to develop depression within six months, regardless of personality type.Published in the Journal of Affective Disorders Reports, the study, “Associations between social media use, personality structure, and development of depression,” was co-authored by Renae Merrill, a doctoral student in the Public Policy Program at the University of Arkansas.This new study found strong and linear associations of depression across all personality traits.”Among the study’s findings was that people with high agreeableness were 49% less likely to become depressed than people with low agreeableness. 

- “Connecting to people virtually may increase the risk of miscommunication or misperception that leads to relationship difficulties and potential risk for developing mental health problems.”“People have innate emotional needs for social connection and understanding,” Merrill added. 

- Despite our differences, we have the ability to create a culture of empathy and kindness.”Which grains you eat can impact your risk of getting heart disease earlierIsfahan University of Medical Sciences (Iran), October 3, 2022In one of the first studies to examine the relationship between different types of grain intake and premature coronary artery disease in the Middle East, researchers found a higher intake of refined grain was associated with an increased risk of premature coronary artery disease in an Iranian population, while eating whole grains was associated with reduced risk.According to the researchers, previous epidemiological studies have reported an association between different types of grain intake with the risk of coronary artery disease. 

- The current study evaluated the association between refined and whole grains consumption and risk of PCAD in an Iranian population.Premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) refers to atherosclerotic narrowing of coronary arteries in males under 55 years old or in females under 65 years old. 

- It is often asymptomatic early in the course of the disease but may lead to chest pain (angina) and/or heart attack with progressive development of narrowing (stenosis) or plaque rupture of the arterial wall. 

- The ACC/American Heart Association Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease recommends a diet that emphasizes the intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains and fish to decrease heart disease risk factors.The study recruited 2099 individuals with PCAD from hospitals with catheterization labs in different cities and ethnicities throughout Iran who underwent coronary angiography (women aged ≤ 70 and men ≤ 60). 

- The findings suggest aromatic turmerone could be a future drug candidate for treating neurological disorders, such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.The study looked at the effects of aromatic (ar-) turmerone on endogenous neutral stem cells (NSC), which are stem cells found within adult brains. 

- The other compound is curcumin, which is well known for its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties.Study finds mind-body practices lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetesUniversity of Southern California School of Medicine, September 30, 2022Mind-body practices such as yoga and meditation are increasingly popular tools for promoting health and combating diseases, including type 2 diabetes. 

- The authors noted that a 1% reduction is particularly notable because metformin, the most prescribed diabetes drug, reduces hemoglobin A1c in people with type 2 diabetes by 1.1% on average.The research suggests that mind-body practices could be used as a both as a complementary nonpharmacological treatment for people with type 2 diabetes and possibly as a preventive measure as well.Compound in Celery Found to Destroy 86% of Lung Cancer CellsGuangdong Pharmaceutical University (China),   September 28th, 2022Celery ihas been found to be extremely effective at killing ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, breast, liver, and lung cancer cells. 

- It is still not definitive through the scientists research, however, if the apigenin alone does the work of killing cancerous cells or if they work in cooperation with other compounds found in celeryFurthering the link, other research found: “Apigenin widely inhibits cell proliferation of various lung cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and the combination treatment of apigenin and antitumor drugs is very effective in human lung cancer cells, and Nrf2-ARE pathway may contribute to the mechanism.”And another study’s abstract focusing on the broader impact of fruit and vegetable intake on cancer concluded:“In particular, high intake of Chinese cabbage (OR = 0.53), chives (OR = 0 .54), carrots (OR = 0.51) and celery (OR = 0.40) was inversely associated with lung cancer. 

- The irregular pumping of blood can lead to blood clots, which may travel to the brain and cause stroke.The researchers evaluated data from more than 5,000 adults collected over several years in the Framingham Heart Study, including echocardiograms, medical history and self-reported alcohol intake. 

- Every additional drink per day also was associated with a statistically significant 0.16 millimeter enlargement of the left atrium, highlighting a possible site of physical damage caused by drinkingGinger effective for muscle pain reliefUniversity of Georgia,  Sep 29, 2022A new study has suggested that daily doses of raw or heat-treated ginger are effective for relieving muscle pain following strenuous exercise.Some research has shown that ginger may have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties similar to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 

- Seventy-four students were divided in three groups given either raw ginger, heated ginger or placebo.The authors hypothesized that pain ratings after exercise would be lower in the ginger group compared to placebo subjects.Results from the subjects’ responses data showed that both raw and heat-treated ginger lowered muscle pain intensity after eccentric exercise by 25 and 23 per cent, respectively. 

- Heat treating ginger, therefore, did not increase the analgesic benefit.Whether ground, instant or decaffeinated, coffee drinking associated with longer lifeBaker Heart and Diabetes Research Institute (Australia), September 28 2022.Regardless of the type of coffee consumed, people who drink coffee may live longer, as indicated by research findings reported in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.“In this large, observational study, ground, instant and decaffeinated coffee were associated with equivalent reductions in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and death from cardiovascular disease or any cause,” senior author Peter Kistler, PhD, stated.The study included 449,563 men and women enrolled in the UK Biobank, which recruited UK residents from 2006 to 2010 and collected data concerning dietary intake, including coffee consumed, and other factors. 

- Individuals included in the current investigation did not have cardiovascular disease or heart arrhythmias at the beginning of the study.During an average follow-up of 12.5 years, 27,809 deaths occurred. 

- Drinking any type of coffee was also associated with a reduced chance of developing cardiovascular disease, and 2 to 3 cups was again associated with the most protection. 

- “It is likely that the non-caffeinated compounds were responsible for the positive relationships observed between coffee drinking, cardiovascular disease and survival. 

- “They had greater inhibitory control, working memory and overall executive function.”Toddlers who got daily physical activity also did significantly better on tests of working memory than those who didn’t, the researchers found.How rosemary essential oil can improve memory by 75 percentNorthumbria University (UK),In a British study, researchers found that sniffing the essential oil of rosemary improved memory by a remarkable 75 percent – making it a possible treatment for memory problems.The study, conducted by psychologists at Northumbria University in Newcastle, involved 66 people. 

- ”To that end, Kuman contends that energy healing could be especially useful for disease prevention, by addressing energy imbalances before they lead to illness. 

- Kuman also notes that the practice of acupuncture may offer similar benefits to Reiki, particularly regarding disease prevention.Low-calorie sugar substitute consumption during adolescence appears to impair memory later in lifeUniversity of Southern California, September 29, 2022A high-sugar diet early in life has been shown to harm brain function, but what about low-calorie sugar substitutes? 

- A new study reveals they may take a heavy toll on the developing brain and gut.In a study published in the journal JCI Insight, scientists at USC show that adolescent rats that consumed the low-calorie sweetenerssaccharin, ACE-K and stevia exhibited long-term impairments in memory.The findings align with those from earlier studies in which the researchers show that adolescent rats that consume sugar suffer lingering memory impairment.Consuming low-calorie sweeteners also affected metabolic signaling in the body, which can lead to diabetes and other metabolism-related diseases.Rats that consumed low-calorie sweeteners as adolescents were less willing to work for sugar as adults, but they consumed more sugar if it was freely available, another factor that might affect the likelihood of developing metabolic disease.While most studies of low-calorie sweeteners focus on one substance and use amounts far exceeding the norm, the researchers made sure the study was in line with real-life conditions for people — Sweeteners tested include saccharin, acesulfame potassium (ACE-K) and stevia—which are commonly used in sweetened foods.In the end, rats consuming sweetener were less likely to remember an object or the path through the maze than those that drank only plain water.The scientists also found other effects among the rats after they consumed sweeteners.They had fewer receptors on their tongues that detect sweet taste.The biological mechanism in their intestines that transports glucose into the blood was altered.Their brains had changed, specifically in regions associated with memory control and reward-motivated behavior.Study finds folic acid treatment is associated with decreased risk of suicide attemptsUniversity of Chicago, September 28, 2022Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the US, with more than 45,000 people dying by suicide in 2020.The study, published in JAMA Psychiatry used data from the health insurance claims of 866,586 patients and looked at the relationship between folic acidtreatment and suicide attempts over a two-year period. 

- Surprisingly, folic acid was associated with a decreased risk of suicide attempt, along with drugs expected to be associated with risk of suicide, like antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics.To investigate and further confirm the relationship between folic acid and suicide risk, Gibbons and his co-authors did this new study and focused specifically on folic acid, and accounted for many possible confounding factors, including age, sex, mental health diagnoses, other central nervous system drugs, conditions that affect folic acid metabolism, and more.They even found that the longer a person took folic acid, the lower their risk of suicide attempt tended to be.

- This can either prevent metabolic syndrome, or aid in treating diabetes.The boost in energy production also helps to enhance athletic performance and recovery.Kawaziri shared the results of a 2016 study on the effects of black ginger extract intake on physical strength, skin condition, post-exercise fatigue, and general fatigue.Subjects who had been given the extract reported an increase in strength, and being less fatigued overall and after exercise.Brains and brawnKawaziri said this was important for the elderly as well, since the extract is believed to minimise muscle loss. 

- He added that the extract could play a part in “preventing poor blood circulation” and lowering blood pressure.Furthermore, he said the extract could help to enhance and maintain cognitive function, delaying or perhaps even preventing diseases like Alzheimer’s.Higher levels of fluoride in pregnant woman linked to lower intelligence in their childrenUniversity of TorontoFluoride in the urine of pregnant women shows a correlation with lower measures of intelligence in their children, according to University of Toronto researchers who conducted the first study of its kind and size to examine fluoride exposure and multiple states of neurodevelopment.“Our study shows that the growing fetal nervous system may be adversely affected by higher levels of fluoride exposure,” said Dr. Howard Hu, the study’s principal investigator and professor of environmental health, epidemiology and global health at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health. 

- “It also suggests that the prenatal nervous system may be more sensitive to fluoride compared to that of school-aged children.”Tap water and dental products have been fluoridated in communities in Canada and the United States (as well as milk and table salt in some other countries) by varying amounts for more than 60 years to prevent cavities and improve bone health. 

- Skeletal fluorosis – excessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones – is much less common and only observed at levels of fluoride in the water that are more than five to 10 times higher than those recommended.“Relatively little is known, with confidence, about fluoride’s impact on neurodevelopment,” said Hu, whose research team included experts from U of T, National Institute of Public Health of Mexico, University of Michigan, McGill University, Indiana University, Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Harvard School of Public Health.The study, “Prenatal Fluoride Exposure and Cognitive Outcomes in Children at 4 and 6-12 Years of Age in Mexico,” published today in Environmental Health Perspectives, analyzed data from 287 mother-child pairs in Mexico City that were part of the Early Life Exposures in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) project, which recruited pregnant women from 1994 to 2005 and has continued to follow the women and their children ever since.The research team analyzed urine samples that had been taken from mothers during pregnancy and from their children between six and 12 years of age to reconstruct personal measures of fluoride exposure for both mother and child.“This is significant because previous studies estimated exposures based on neighbourhood measurements of drinking water fluoride levels, which are indirect and much less precise measures of exposure. 

- However, in Dr. Hu’s opinion, the findings do not provide enough information to suggest there is no safe level of fluoride exposure.“The potential risks associated with fluoride should be further studied, particularly among vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children, and more research on fluoride’s impact on the developing brain is clearly needed.”Polyphenol blend may boost post-exercise recovery: RCTUniversity of Murcia (Spain), and the University of Montpellier (France)Daily supplementation with a blend of extracts from mangosteen, elderberry, and pomegranate may delay muscle soreness and help manage post-exercise recovery, says a new study.Consumption of Fytexia’s polyphenol-rich ingredient branded TensLess was associated with a 28% reduction in the perception of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), compared with a placebo group, according to results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study.Biomarkers of muscle damage were also reduced, in correlation with the decreases in DOMS, reported scientists from Fytexia (France), Catholic University of Murcia (Spain), and the University of Montpellier (France) in the journal Phytotherapy Research .“This prospective study highlights the beneficial, both acute and sub-chronic effects of the supplementation with TensLess, a polyphenol-rich extract-based food supplement, on adverse symptoms associated with DOMS, namely eccentric exercise-related markers of muscle impairment,” they wrote.Study detailsThe researchers recruited 13 recreationally active athletes (men and women) to participate in their study. 

- All of the study participants performed an eccentric exercise protocol on day one of the study, and DOMS and biomarkers of muscle damage were monitored for four more days. 

- This was then followed by a three-week “washout” period before they were crossed over to the other group for five more days.The results showed that TensLess supplementation provided a significant 33% decrease in DOMS perception as early as the first 24 hours following physical exercise, compared to placebo. 

- In addition to this acute benefit, a 28% reduction in DOMS perception was reported compared to the placebo group for the full duration of the study.These effects were correlated with a lower levels of muscle damage-associated biomarkers, specifically creatine kinase, creatinine and myoglobin during the 4 days post-workout, added the researchers.Taken together, these positive results clearly indicate that post-exercise supplementation with TensLess may preserve myocytes and reduce soreness following eccentric exercise-induced damages, and, accordingly, significantly shorten muscle recovery.Study supports efficacy of hyaluronan for wrinkle reductionToho University Ohashi Medical Center (Japan)Twelve weeks of supplementation with hyaluronan – also known as hyaluronic acid – may improve the “luster” of the skin and reduce wrinkles, says a new study from Japan.Data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 60 adults indicated that 120 milligrams per day of Kewpie’s hyaluronan ingredients Hyabest (A) and Hyabest (S) LF-P also led to improvements in skin suppleness.“This study showed that the oral ingestion of the [molecular weight] 2 k or 300 k [hyaluronic acid] for 12 weeks suppresses wrinkles and improves the skin’s luster and suppleness in people aged 59 years or less who were healthy Japanese men and women over 22 years old. 

- From the above, [hyaluronic acid] consumption is expected to be used as a method to maintain healthy skin,” wrote researchers from Kewpie Corporation and the Toho University Ohashi Medical Center in Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology .Kewpie Corp funded the study.HA and skinThe skin contains about 50% of the body’s hyaluronan (HA), a component present in every connective tissue. 

- Degradation of HA and collagen is reported to be a cause of wrinkles, with many ingredient suppliers exploring the potential of supplementation to improve skin health from within.Scientists from Kewpie authored a review i published in the Nutrition Journal, which concluded: “The reduction of HA in the skin by intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as aging and ultraviolet radiation, smoking and air pollutants induce dryness in the skin. 

- However, only the 300 k (Hyabest (S) LF-P) group showed significantly diminished wrinkles compared with the placebo group.Exercise can make cells healthier, promoting longer life, study findsUniversity of VirginiaWhether it’s running, walking, cycling, swimming or rowing, it’s been well-known since ancient times that doing some form of aerobic exercise is essential to good health and well-being. 

- “And exercise capacity, mainly determined by muscle size and function, is the best predictor of mortality in the general population.”Yan and colleagues have completed a study in mice that, for the first time, shows that just one bout of moderate-to-intense exercise acts as a “stress test” on mitochondria in muscles. 

- They discovered that this “stress test” induced by aerobic exercise triggers a process called mitophagy, where the muscle disposes of the damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria, making the muscle healthier. 

- Yan compares exercise-induced mitophagy to a state vehicle inspection that removes damaged cars from the streets.“Aerobic exercise removes damaged mitochondria in skeletal muscle,” Yan said. 

- We clean up the clunkers, now the city, the cell, is full of healthy, functional cars.”How Exercise Removes Mitochondria ‘Clunkers’For this study, Yan and colleagues assessed the skeletal muscle of a mouse model where they had added a mitochondrial reporter gene called “pMitoTimer.” The mitochondria fluoresce green when they are healthy and turn red when damaged and broken down by the cell’s waste-disposal system, the lysosomes.The mice ran on a small treadmill for 90 minutes and Yan’s team observed mitochondrial stress (signs of “state inspection”) and some mitophagy (towing of the clunkers) at six hours after exercise. 

- Yan explained that exercise in these mice also stimulated a kinase called AMPK, which in turn switched on another kinase, Ulk1. 

- This device for making vitamin D is ideally suited for patients with fat malabsorption syndromes including inflammatory bowel disease and gastric bypass surgery.The research shows that LEDs could be used for treating patients that are vitamin D deficient.

- In a recent study, researchers from The Salk Institute for Biological Studies discovered a potential natural treatment for Alzheimer’s in the form of a medicinal herb found in California.In their study published in the journal Redox Biology, they found that yerba santa (Eriodictyon californicum), a plant native to California, contains an active compound called sterubin that could be used to treat people with Alzheimer’s. 

- Yerba santa, which is the Spanish for “holy herb,” is highly regarded as a medicine for respiratory diseases, bruising, fever, headaches, infections, and pain.For the current study, the researchers first examined 400 plant extracts with known medicinal properties for their ability to prevent oxytosis – a type of cell death that occurs in Alzheimer’s disease – in mouse hippocampal nerve cells.The researchers found that sterubin exhibited the greatest protective effect against inflammation and other triggers of brain cell death. 

- Iron accumulation can result in a type of nerve cell damage that accompanies aging and occurs in neurodegenerative problems.“Not only did sterubin turn out to be much more active than the other flavonoids in Yerba santa in our assays, it appears as good as, if not better than, other flavonoids we have studied,” said Pamela Maher, the corresponding author of the study.Vitamin B may reduce risk of strokeZhengzhou University (China)  September 23, 2022Researchers have uncovered evidence that suggests vitamin B supplements could help to reduce the risk of stroke, according to a study published in the journal Neurology.Vitamin B supplements are said to be beneficial for many health issues, including stress, anxiety, depression, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and heart disease.However, according to Xu Yuming of Zhengzhou University in Zhengzhou, China, previous studies have conflicting findings regarding the use of vitamin B supplements and stroke or heart attack.In order to determine the role of vitamin B supplements in the risk of stroke, Prof. Yuming and colleagues analyzed 14 randomized clinical trials involving a total of 54,913 participants  All studies compared use of vitamin B supplements with a placebo, or a very low dosage of the vitamin. 

- Low levels of these important neurotransmitters can be detrimental to health.Subsequent to injecting lab rats with MSG, researchers injected ginger root extract for 30 more days and were able to completely reverse the neurotransmitter depletion and brain damage that MSG caused. 

- Anyone suffering from a disease or immunity issue that would contribute to a weakened blood-brain barrier is then much more susceptible to the chemical seeping into his or her brain and doing damage. 

- Studies have effectively linked MSG consumption to several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.Men with anxiety are more likely to die of cancer, study saysCambridge University’s Institute of Public Health, September 20, 2022Men over 40 who are plagued with generalized anxiety disorder are more than twice as likely to die of cancer than are men who do not have the mental affliction, new research finds. 

- Among men in the cohort, 1.8 percent did.Whatever the relationship, says the study’s lead author, the new findings identify extremely anxious men as a population whose mental and physical health should be closely tracked.“Society may need to consider anxiety as a warning signal for poor health,” said study lead author Olivia Remes of Cambridge University’s Institute of Public Health. 

- “With this study, we show that anxiety is more than just a personality trait,” but rather, a disorder linked to real and serious health risks.Out of Over 400 Compounds Analyzed, Red Grapes and Blueberries Are Tops In Boosting Immunity – So Effective They Work As Well As DrugsLinus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University, September 18, 2022Pterostilbene, an antioxidant produced by plants has been shown to exhibit exceptional properties in fighting infections, cancer, hypertriglycerides, as well as the ability to reverse cognitive decline. 

- Both of these compounds, which are called stilbenoids, worked in synergy with vitamin D and had a significant impact in raising the expression of the human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, or CAMP gene, that is involved in immune function.The research was published in Molecular Nutrition and Food Research, in studies supported by the National Institutes of Health. 

- These molecules battle cell and DNA damage involved in cancer, heart disease, diabetes and perhaps also brain degeneration. 

- It’s actually found in the skin of red grapes along with other nutrients, such as minerals manganese and potassium and vitamins K, C and B1.Stilbenoids are compounds produced by plants to fight infections, and in human biology appear to affect some of the signaling pathways that allow vitamin D to do its job, researchers said. 

- It appears that combining these compounds with vitamin D has considerably more biological impact than any of them would separately.Fungus in humans identified for first time as key factor in Crohn’s diseaseCase Western Reserve University, September 22, 2022A Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine-led team of international researchers has for the first time identified a fungus as a key factor in the development of Crohn’s disease. 

- The groundbreaking findings, published in mBio, could lead to potential new treatments and ultimately, cures for the debilitating inflammatory bowel disease, which causes severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue.Mycology at Case Western Reserve and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center “Essentially, patients with Crohn’s have abnormal immune responses to these bacteria, which inhabit the intestines of all people. 

- Our study adds significant new information to understanding why some people develop Crohn’s disease. 

- Equally important, it can result in a new generation of treatments, including medications and probiotics, which hold the potential for making qualitative and quantitative differences in the lives of people suffering from Crohn’s.”The researchers assessed the mycobiome and bacteriome of patients with Crohn’s disease and their Crohn’s-free first degree relatives in nine families in northern France and Belgium, and in Crohn’s-free individuals from four families living in the same geographic area. 

- The researchers found strong fungal-bacterial interactions in those with Crohn’s disease: two bacteria (Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens) and one fungus (Candida tropicalis) moved in lock step. 

- Additionally, test-tube research by the Ghannoum-led team found that the three work together (with the E. coli cells fusing to the fungal cells and S. marcescens forming a bridge connecting the microbes) to produce a biofilm — a thin, slimy layer of microorganisms found in the body that adheres to, among other sites, a portion of the intestines — which can prompt inflammation that results in the symptoms of Crohn’s disease.This is first time any fungus has been linked to Crohn’s in humans; previously it was only found in mice with the disease.

- The news comes from Xi’an, People’s Republic of China, and shows great promise for those suffering from mental impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and other debilitating cognitive conditions.The study abstract concludes:“Our results provide new insights into the pharmacological actions of rutin and suggest that rutin has multi-targeted therapeutical potential on cognitive deficits associated with conditions with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion such as vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.”Rutin is a biologically active flavonoid found in the following foods:Buckwheat – Possibly the best source of rutin, and much better than boiled oats, uncooked buckwheat leaf flower offers about 675 mg in a 1.1 cup serving. 

- The study is published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.Hypertension, also known as chronic high blood pressure, can lead to a wide variety of health problems, from loss of vision to strokes and heart attacks. 

- Typically, patients are directed to modify their diet and to exercise more. 

- They also note that it is similar to changes in many patients who begin an aerobic exercise regimen, such as walking, cycling or running. 

- They suggest such training could be used by patients of all ages who are unable to exercise to lower their blood pressure.How To Maintain Peak Brain Health: Scientists Say It Comes Down To These 3 FactorsNorwegian University of Science and Technology, September 23, 2022What’s the best way to maintain peak brain health as we age? 

- There are countless studies detailing ways to prevent cognitive decline, so scientists in Norway sought to simplify the science of managing strong brain health to three recommendations.This report is something of a summation covering modern science’s current understanding of how best to cultivate robust brain health. 

- The team at NTNU cite 101 references to prior articles in this latest theoretical perspective paper.“Three factors stand out if you want to keep your brain at its best,” Prof. Sigmundsson adds.The three identified keys to strong brain health are:Physical exerciseSocial activityStrong, passionate interests and hobbiesIt’s common knowledge that spending all day on the couch isn’t healthy for the body, but physical activity is also key to brain health. 

- Physical exercise, relationships and passion help to develop and maintain the basic structures of our brain as we get older,” Prof. Sigmundsson concludes.Calcium supplements may support a healthy colon: Harvard studyHarvard School of Public Health, September 18, 2022Supplements of calcium or non-dairy products fortified with the mineral may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, according to meta-analysis of prospective observational studies by researchers at Harvard School of Public Health.For every 300 mg increase in calcium from supplements was associated with a 9% reduction in risk, wrote NaNa Keum and her co-authors in the International Journal of Cancer .Every 300 mg increase in total calcium was associated with a similar reduction in risk (8%), they added.“Our findings have several important clinical and public health implications,” they explained. 

- “First, according to the 2003 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey in the U.S., median total calcium intake of adults aged over 50 years was approximately 650 mg/day for no calcium-supplement users and 1,000 mg/day for calcium-supplement users.“As the benefit of calcium intake on CRC is expected to continue beyond 1,000 mg/day, not only non-supplement users but also supplement users may further reduce their CRC risk through additional calcium intake.”“Second, while dairy products, especially milk, are the major sources of calcium in many countries, they are a substantial source of calories and contain potentially harmful factors such as saturated fat, hormones, and casein proteins. 

- Here are some additional benefits confirmed in 2014 alone:Age-Related Respiratory Problems: A 2014 study from the journal of Human Kinetics found that a 3 month yoga intervention in 36 elderly women (average age 63.1) significantly improved pulmonary (respiratory) function.Age-Related Brain Cognitive Decline: A review in the Journals of Gerontology, involving a two month Hatha yoga intervention in the elderly (average age 62.0) resulted in significant improvements in “executive function measures of working memory capacity and efficiency of mental set shifting and flexibility compared with their stretching-strengthening counterparts.”Age-Related Hormone Insufficiency: A study published in Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine found that a 3 month yogic intervention in men (average age 42.8) and women (average age 44.75) resulted in improvements in the level of growth hormone and DHEAS, two essential hormones that drop off precipitously as we age.Age-Related Sleep Problems: Astudy published in Alternatives Therapies in Health and Medicine found a 12 week yogic intervention (yoga 2x a week) resulted in significant improvements in the quality of sleep in older individuals (average age 60).Age-Related Depression: From the Chinese Journal of Nursing found that not only did yoga improve sleep as found in the study above but also significantly reduced the depressive symptoms of elderly participants…after 6 months. 

- These children attained even greater improvements in several tests, including faster reading already after three months of receiving fatty acid supplements.Mango could help maintain gut bacteria at risk from high-fat dietsOklahoma State University, SEPTEMBER 21, 2022Mango consumption could help prevent the loss of beneficial gut bacteria caused by a high fat diet, according to research on mice.The findings, published in the Journal of Nutrition , appears to reveal for the first time the positive impact of mango on gut microbiota.In the study, 60 male mice were assigned to one of four dietary treatment groups for 12 weeks - control (with 10% of calories from fat), high fat (with 60% calories from fat), or high fat with 1% or 10% mango. 

- All high-fat diets had similar macronutrient, calcium, phosphorus, and fiber content.“We investigated the effects of freeze-dried mango pulp combined with an high-fat diet on the cecal microbial population and its relation to body composition, lipids, glucose parameters, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and gut inflammatory markers in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity,” the study reports.The high-fat dietary treatment with 10% mango (equivalent to 1½ cups of fresh mango pieces) was found to be the most effective in preventing the loss of beneficial bacteria from a high-fat diet without decreasing body weight or fat accumulation.Specifically, mango supplementation regulated gut bacteria in favor of Bifidobacteria and Akkermansia and enhanced short-chain fatty acid (SFCA) production. 

- The study is believed to be the largest randomized trial so far to examine the effect of yoga on physical and psychological health and quality of life among people with arthritis.The study recruited 75 people with either knee osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. 

- Improvements in those who completed yoga was still apparent nine months later.Stevia Kills Lyme Disease Pathogen Better Than Antibiotics (Preclinical Study)University of New Haven, September 21, 2022A promising new preclinical study has revealed that whole stevia leaf extract possesses exceptional antibiotic activity against the exceedingly difficult to treat pathogen Borrelia Burgdorferi known to cause Lyme disease. 

- "At present, the CDC acknowledges that at least 300,000 are infected with Lyme disease, annually, with the conventional standard of care relying on antibiotics that are not only toxic but increasingly coming under scrutiny for addressing only surface aspects of the infection, often leaving antibiotic-resistance Lyme disease deep within the system to continue to cause harm.The new study was published in the European Journal of Microbiology & Immunology and conducted by researchers from the Department of Biology and Environmental Science, University of New Haven, West Haven, CT.The researchers directly compared an alcohol extract of a whole stevia leaf product commonly found on the U.S. retail market to conventional antibiotics, and assessed their respective abilities to kill the various forms of Borrelia burgdorferi, including so called "persister" forms.The researchers explored Stevia's potential effectiveness against B. burgdorferi cultures, comparing it to three common antibiotics sometimes used to treat Lyme's disease: doxycycline, cefoperazone, daptomycin, as well as their combination.The study results were summarized as follows:     Our results demonstrated that Stevia had significant effect in eliminating B. burgdorferi spirochetes and persisters. 

- Stevia, on the other hand, reduced the biofilm mass on both tested surfaces (plastic and collagen) by about 40%.Green soy extract could prevent cognitive dysfunction: Mouse dataUniversity of Shizuoka (Japan), September 19, 2022Intake of green soybean extract could help reverse cognitive dysfunction and its associated accumulation of beta-amyloid proteins in the brain, say researchers.The accumulation of beta-amyloid proteins has long been linked to the development of brain stunting conditions including Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia.Writing in the Journal of Functional Foods, the team revealed that brain functions were ‘significantly better-preserved’ in aged mice fed green soybean than age-matched control mice with or without yellow soybean feeding.An increased expression of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (Ptgds) and a significant reduction in the amyloid precursor protein Aplp1 was reported by the team, led by Keiko Unno from the University of Shizuoka in Japan.“Furthermore, the amount of beta-amyloid 40 and 42 was reduced in the insoluble fraction of cerebral cortex,” the team noted.In the current study, the isoflavones found to be present in soybean extracts were mostly the glycosides genstin and daidzin. 

- Furthermore, the contents of saponin and carotene in green soybean were found to be slightly higher in the green than in yellow, however the contents of other components were not different between green and yellow soybeans.JAMA study links low vitamin D levels to ‘profound’ and ‘rapid’ cognitive declineRutgers University & University of California Davis, September 15, 2022Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency may have “substantial” accelerating effects on cognitive decline in the elderly, says a new study from UC Davis and Rutgers University.Low levels of the sunshine vitamin were associated with a three times faster rate of cognitive decline than those with adequate vitamin D levels, according to findings published in JAMA Neurology .The low vitamin D levels were associated with impaired performance, particularly in domains such as memory loss that are associated with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, added the researchers.The researchers said their findings amplify the importance of identifying vitamin D insufficiency among the elderly, particularly high-risk groups such as African-Americans and Hispanics, who are less able to absorb the nutrient from its most plentiful source: sunshine. 

- Among those groups and other darker-skinned individuals, low vitamin D should be considered a risk factor for dementia, they added.Dr Miller and his co-workers analyzed data from 382 racially and ethnically diverse men and women (mean age of 76) in Northern California participating in longitudinal research at the Alzheimer’s Disease Center in Sacramento.

- “Although pain scores in the blackcurrant nectar group returned to baseline a day earlier than the placebo group, there were no significant differences observed between groups at any time point after exercise.The study included 16 college students randomly assigned to consumer either the blackcurrant nectar beverage (CurrantC provided by CropPharms from Staatsburg, NY) or placebo twice a day for eight days. 

- On day 4 the participants performed a bout of knee extension exercises, and blood samples taken 24, 48, and 96 hours after the exercise.Results showed that ORAC levels in the blood significantly decreased in the placebo group, while no significant decreases from the baseline values were observed in the blackcurrant group. 

- In addition, significant differences between the groups were observed for IL-6 levels 24 hours after exercise, while significant differences were observed in creatine kinase activity between the groups after 48 and 96 hours..How does what we eat affect our health span and longevity? 

- It’s a complex, dynamic systemColumbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, September 21, 2022How does what we eat affect how we age? 

- The answer to this relatively concise question is unavoidably complex, according to a new study at the Butler Columbia Aging Center at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. 

- The findings are published online in the journal BMC Biology.While most analyses had been concerned with the effects of a single nutrient on a single outcome, a conventional, unidimensional approach to understanding the effects of diet on health and aging no longer provides us with the full picture: A healthy diet must be considered based on the balance of ensembles of nutrients, rather than by optimizing a series of nutrients one at a time. 

- The effects of diet used the geometric framework for nutrition, applied to macronutrients and 19 micronutrients/nutrient subclasses. 

- Simpler analytical approaches are insufficient to capture such associations.Mediterranean diet could play a key role in preventing cognitive declineBrigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard University, September 20, 2022Individuals of minoritized ethnic or racial groups are often underrepresented in research, thus hindering the understanding of risk factors and the efficacy of treatments for diseases in these minoritized groups.A recent study published in the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia found that the levels of six plasma metabolites were associated with lower cognitive function across all racial/ethnic groups, and the levels of most of these blood metabolites were associated with adherence to a Mediterranean diet.Speaking to Medical News Today, the study’s corresponding author Dr. Tamar Sofer, a professor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital at Harvard University, said:“We identified a few metabolites (small molecules) in blood that their levels are correlated with cognitive function, and they are all related to diet.Characterizing metabolites associated with cognitive function can help researchers understand the mechanisms underlying the development of dementia. 

- Moreover, blood metabolites can be easily measured and could serve as biomarkers for cognitive function.A previous study involving older Puerto Rican individuals showed that the levels of 13 blood metabolites were associated with global cognitive function, which is a composite measure of multiple cognitive abilities.Metabolite levels are influenced by the interplay between genetics, health status, and environmental factors, including diet, other lifestyle factors, and socioeconomic factors, which may differ among and even within ethnic/racial groups.The meta-analysis showed that six blood metabolites were associated with lower cognitive function across all ethnic/racial groups. 

- ), and blood metabolite levels.They found that adhering to a Mediterranean diet or its component food groups was correlated with several blood metabolites assessed in the study.Notably, the strongest association was observed between beta-cryptoxanthin and fruit intake participants.Beta-cryptoxanthin is a carotenoid with antioxidant properties found in fruits and vegetables, and beta-cryptoxanthin levels are associated with a lower risk of insulin resistance and liver dysfunction.“[T]his study is a step in the right direction in relation to examining the role of diet and the body’s metabolism for brain health. 

- It provides suggestive evidence that adherence to a good diet such as the Mediterranean style diet may be beneficial for brain health over a wide age range.”Indigo Rose Tomatoes Contain An Antioxidant That Fights Diabetes, Cancer and Neurodegenerative DiseasesOregon State University, September 15, 2022Not only do dark tomatoes turn heads, but they are also healthier than normal red varieties, according to plant scientists.

- The study is also the first to show that catching up on sleep doesn’t reverse the effects of sleep disruption.“This study begins to identify the biological mechanisms that link sleep and immunological health over the long-term. 

- This is important because it is yet another key observation that sleep reduces inflammation and, conversely, that sleep interruption increases inflammation,” says lead author Filip Swirski, Ph.D., Director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute at Icahn Mount Sinai.“This work emphasizes the importance of adults consistently sleeping seven to eight hours a day to help prevent inflammation and disease, especially for those with underlying medical conditions.”A team of investigators analyzed 14 healthy adults who regularly sleep eight hours a night. 

- A notable finding from the mouse group was that even after sleep recovery, the immune stem cells retained this rewiring structure, and they continued to produce additional white blood cells, making the mice susceptible to inflammation and disease.“Our findings suggest that sleep recovery is not able to fully reverse the effects of poor-quality sleep. 

- This molecular imprint can cause the cells to respond in inappropriate ways leading to inflammation and disease,” says co-lead investigator Cameron McAlpine, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at Icahn Mount Sinai. 

- It was additionally revealed that ANP32A deficiency was associated with osteopenia and a neurologic disease known as cerebellar ataxia in mice and that NAC helped with these conditions.“Aging, a key risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis, is associated with elevated oxidative damage of DNA, proteins, and lipids, and accumulating evidence indicates that oxidative stress is a major physiological inducer of aging,” the authors write. 

- Thus, ANP32A can be considered as a key coordinator of oxidative stress and aging in joints.”“Our findings indicate that modulating ANP32A signaling could help manage oxidative stress in cartilage, brain, and bone with therapeutic implications for osteoarthritis, neurological disease, and osteoporosis,” they conclude.Consuming Soy Peptide May Reduce Colon Cancer MetastasisUniversity of Illinois, September 18, 2022After a recent University of Illinois study showed that injection of the soy peptide lunasin dramatically reduced colon cancer metastasis in mice, the researchers were eager to see how making lunasin part of the animals’ daily diet would affect the spread of the disease.“In this new study, we find that giving lunasin orally at 20 mg/kg of body weight reduced the number of metastatic tumors by 94 percent — we went from 18 tumors to only one. 

- Globally, this represents a small, but meaningful, 1.5-point gain between 1990 and 2018, researchers from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University report today in the journal Nature Food.The study, one of the most comprehensive estimates yet of global dietary quality—and the first to include findings among children as well as adults—highlights the challenges worldwide to encourage healthy eating. 

- Although global gains were modest, there was notable variation by country, with nutritious options becoming more popular in the United States, Vietnam, China, and Iran, and less so in Tanzania, Nigeria, and Japan.“Intake of legumes/nuts and non-starchy vegetables increased over time, but overall improvements in dietary quality were offset by increased intake of unhealthy components such as red/processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and sodium,” says lead author Victoria Miller, a visiting scientist from McMaster University in Canada who started this study as a postdoctoral scholar with Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean for Policy and Jean Mayer Professor of Nutrition at the Friedman School, and senior author on the paper.Miller and colleagues addressed this gap by measuring global, regional, and national eating patterns among adults and children across 185 countries based on data from over 1,100 surveys from the Global Dietary Database, a large, collaborative compilation of data on food and nutrient consumption levels worldwide.

- Researchers there have shown that a breathing-based meditation practice called Sudarshan Kriya Yoga can be an effective treatment for PTSD.Standard treatment interventions for PTSD offer mixed results. 

- Each subject’s mental health was measured via a survey asking about symptoms including anxiety, depression, loneliness, and overall mental wellbeing. 

- Consequently, researchers theorize that the increased inferior frontal cortex activity among cognitively strong older individuals may be an avenue for older minds to compensate during mentally tougher tasks.Drinking plenty of tea may reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, finds study in over a million adultsWuhan University of Science and Technology (China), September 17, 2022A systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 cohort studies involving more than 1 million adults from eight countries finds that moderate consumption of black, green or Oolong tea is linked to a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.The findings, being presented at this year’s European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting in Stockholm, Sweden suggest that drinking at least four cups of tea a day is associated with a 17% lower risk of T2D over an average period of 10 years.While it’s long been known that regularly drinking tea may be beneficial for health because of the various antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic compounds tea contains, less clear has been the relationship between tea drinking and the risk of T2D.

- The effects of exercise are much more nuanced, as specific intensities of exercise over a long period of time are associated with different aspects of memory and mental health, according to a new Dartmouth study. 

- The findings are published in Scientific Reports and provide insight into how exercise could be optimized.“Mental health and memory are central to nearly everything we do in our everyday lives,” says lead author Jeremy Manning, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth. 

- “Our study is trying to build a foundation for understanding how different intensities of physical exercise affect different aspects of mental and cognitive health.”The researchers asked 113 Fitbit users to perform a series of memory tests, answer some questions about their mental health, and share their fitness data from the previous year. 

- They expected that more active individuals would have better memory performance and mental health, but the results were more nuanced. 

- People who tended to exercise at low intensities performed better at some memory tasks while those who exercised at a high intensities did better on other memory tasks. 

- Sedentary participants who seldom exercised tended to perform worse on the spatial memory tasks.The researchers also identified connections between participants’ mental health and their memory performance. 

- Participants who reported higher levels of stress tended to perform worse on the associative memory tasks.Positive psychological well-being can improve overall heart healthNorthwestern University, September 10, 2022Maintaining positive thoughts and feelings through intervention programs can help patients achieve better overall outcomes when it comes to their cardiovascular health, according to a review paper published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.“We addressed how social environment, psychological well-being and the effectiveness of intervention strategies can help strengthen a patient’s outlook,” said Darwin R. Labarthe, MD, MPH, Ph.D., professor of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and the review’s lead author. 

- “We focused on whether psychological well-being can be consistently related with a reduced risk of heart disease.”In this review, the authors looked at a growing body of research to examine whether psychological well-being might lead to reduced risk of heart disease. 

- Prospective studies have shown a positive relationship between optimism (one facet of psychological well-being) and heart disease, including a study showing older women in the highest quartile of optimism had a 38 percent reduced risk of heart disease mortality. 

- Additional studies since 2012 have associated a perceived higher purpose in life with lower odds of having a stroke.Optimistic patients sustained healthier diets by consuming more fruits and vegetables, and less processed meats and sweets, leading patients to maintain a healthy BMI.The review authors found that psychological well-being influenced heart health through biological processes, health behaviors and psychosocial resources.Having a strong network of social support also gives patients confidence about their future health and helps them act readily on medical advice, engage in problem solving and take active preventive measures. 

- A likely link is that favorable social environment, known to influence heart disease risk, has also been shown to predict psychological well-being.Milk thistle protects against COPD caused by secondhand smokeSichuan University, (China), September 11, 2022According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 15.7 million people suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – a serious respiratory condition which can cause scarring of the lungs, narrowing of the airway and extreme difficulty breathing. 

- Groundbreaking new research suggests that milk thistle extracts may not only prevent COPD but, help to treat it.In a study published in the journal Inflammation, researchers exposed mice to the equivalent of 1.5 packs of cigarettes a day for four weeks, creating drastic increases in peribronchial inflammation, thickening of airway walls and airway obstruction.The team found that pretreating the mice with silymarin – the active component of milk thistle – an hour before exposure dramatically decreased inflammatory changes, and cut production of pro-inflammatory chemicals such as TNF-alpha and interleukin.Encouragingly, silymarin also helped safeguard levels of superoxide dismutase, an important disease-fighting antioxidant produced in the body.A year later, the same team of researchers took another, closer look at the workings of milk thistle. 

- They did this by exposing these breast cancer cells to the extract for 48 hours.In addition, they examined the effect of astragulus extract on phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, a primary intracellular signaling pathway that contributes to cell proliferation, growth, migration, metabolism, and apoptosis.The results of the study showed that the treatment of astragulus exhibited anti-proliferative activity on breast cancer cells. 

- “But, until the supplement is tested for safety and commercialized, which we hope will happen after further testing and clinical trials, women should continue consuming a healthy diet with fresh fruits and vegetables.”CBD shows health benefits in estrogen-deficient mice that model postmenopauseRutgers University, September 14, 2022A Rutgers study points to cannabidiol (CBD), a major component of hemp and medical marijuana used to treat conditions such as chronic pain, inflammation, migraines, epilepsy, autoimmune diseases, depression, and anxiety, as a possible treatment for postmenopausal women whose ovaries no longer make estrogen.In a study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology, scientists reported that when estrogen-deficient mice were fed CBD, a non-intoxicating compound extracted from hemp, they showed marked improvement in several areas. 

- “There is much anecdotal evidence of CBD’s health benefits for menopausal and postmenopausal women, but our study is the first to investigate some of the claims in an established preclinical model of postmenopause.”Over 18 weeks, researchers fed the estrogen-deficient mice a steady diet of either tiny, CBD-laced peanut butter balls or peanut butter balls without CBD. 

- However, in mice that ingested CBD, these conditions were significantly improved.Mediterranean diet and depression among older individualsHarokopio University (Greece), September 9, 2022According to news originating from Athens, Greece,research stated, “In Europe, depression is one of the most frequent mental disorders across all age groups, but particularly in people aged 65 years and over, and higher depressive symptoms have been reported among individuals with chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes and heart disease).”Research from Harokopio University stated, “To evaluate the role of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) in depression in a sample of older people living in the Mediterranean basin. 

- In addition, daily tea drinking was also related to the absence of depression [(OR, 95% CI): 0.51, 0.40 – 0.65].”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Greater adherence to the MedDiet and daily tea drinking seem to have a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms in older adults.”High cholesterol leads to long-term liver scarring and immune cell dysfunction in lab studyUniversity of Southern California, September 15, 2022There’s a long-established link between a high-fat, high-sugar diet and fatty liver disease, which can lead to life-threatening conditions such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. 

- Now, new research from the Keck School of Medicine of USC adds some detail and dimension to this picture.The lab study, published in Frontiers in Immunology, is the first-ever to focus on how different amounts of cholesterol as part of a diet high in fat and sugar affect fatty liver disease progression. 

- Modeling the disease in mice, the investigators demonstrated that high cholesterol intake can make fatty liver disease worse—driving inflammation and scarring—and that, importantly, scar tissuecan persist even after switching to a diet low in cholesterol. 

- The findings also indicated that a high-cholesterol diet can create long-lasting dysfunction in a specific population of immune cells previously shown to play a role in fatty liver disease.“We saw that you may have a high-fat and high-sugar diet, but when you add high cholesterol to that, it will accelerate the process that causes inflammation in your liver,” said corresponding author Ana Maretti-Mira, Ph.D., an assistant research professor of medicine at USC. 

- “People focus on high cholesterol as a risk for heart disease, but we showed that your liver may also be affected, causing inflammation, scarring and, potentially, cirrhosis.”High cholesterol makes fatty liver disease worseThe researchers fed mice a high-fat, high-sugar diet shown to cause a form of advanced fatty liver disease similar to human illness.The mice were split into three groups that received different amounts of cholesterol in their food for 20 weeks—midlife for the animals. 

- The low-cholesterol group received one-quarter the cholesterol compared to medium; the high-cholesterol group received 25 times more than the low-cholesterol group.After 20 weeks, the livers of mice from all three groups showed accumulation of fat, a benign feature of fatty liver disease, but the high-cholesterol group had more advanced disease, with increased inflammation and scar tissue.For the following 10 weeks, mice from all three groups received low cholesterol as part of a diet that remained high in fat and sugar. 

- (1:23)Sam Bailey & Jessic Rose Part 1 (22:33)Gary Null Speaking Out at the NYS Assembly Hearing  (25:00)Higher omega-3 levels linked to better sleepUniversity of British Columbia, September 14 2022.Having higher blood concentrations of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) was found to be associated with a reduction in excessive sleep in an analysis reported in 2022 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Sleep duration of over 9 hours per night has been correlated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and premature mortality from all causes.The analysis included 21,653 participants in 12 studies for whom information was available concerning sleep duration and/or difficulty falling asleep and blood levels of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA, DHA, ALA and, when available, DPA, and the omega-6 fatty acids AA and LA.When men and women whose fatty acid levels were among the lowest 20% of participants were compared to those whose levels were among the top 20%, individuals whose DHA intake was highest had a 22% lower risk of excessive sleep. 

- The authors noted that DHA’s role in regulating melatonin production helps regulate sleep.Twice-daily nasal irrigation reduces COVID-related illness, deathMedical College of Georgia at Augusta University, September 13, 2022Starting twice daily flushing of the mucus-lined nasal cavity with a mild saline solution soon after testing positive for COVID-19 can significantly reduce hospitalization and death, investigators report.They say the technique that can be used at home by mixing a half teaspoon each of salt and baking soda in a cup of boiled or distilled water then putting it into a sinus rinse bottle is a safe, effective and inexpensive way to reduce the risk of severe illness and death from coronavirus infection that could have a vital public health impact.“By giving extra hydration to your sinuses, it makes them function better.“We found an 8.5-fold reduction in hospitalizations and no fatalities compared to our controls,” says senior author Dr. Richard Schwartz, chair of the MCG Department of Emergency Medicine. 

- Saline appears to inhibit the virus’ ability to essentially make two cuts in itself, called furin cleavage, so it can better fit into an ACE2 receptor once it spots one.Participants self-administered nasal irrigation using either povidone-iodine, that brown antiseptic that gets painted on your body before surgery, or sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, which is often used as a cleanser, mixed with water that had the same salt concentration normally found in the body.Those who completed nasal irrigation twice daily reported quicker resolution of symptoms regardless of which of two common antiseptics they were adding to the saline water.Eating more spicy foods decreases your risk of early death by 14%Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, September 7, 2022According to an international team of researchers led by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, eating spicy foods may be the key to longevity. 

- While a variety of spicy foods are excellent, one in particular caught their attention.It was noted that consumption of fresh chili pepper, compared to other spicy foods, was most effective in providing people with a lower risk of dying from cancer, ischemic heart disease and diabetes. 

- It’s explained that fresh chili pepper’s combination of powerful ingredients are responsible for such health-boosting benefits. 

- (1)“Compared with non-fresh spicy foods such as dried chilli pepper, chilli sauce or chilli oil,” says Lu Qi, associate professor at Harvard School of Public Health, “fresh chilli pepper is richer in bioactive ingredients, including capsaicin, vitamin C, and other nutrients such as vitamin A, K, and B6 and potassium.”(1)To conduct the study, the experts from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences assessed nearly 490,000 participants.After a follow-up that averaged approximately seven years, 20,224 deaths were noted. 

- Understanding what is happening in children’s brains when they meditate is important because the developing brain is wired differently from the adult brain.Pace as important as 10,000 steps for health, finds new researchUniversity of Sydney and University of South Denmark, September 13, 2022Two studies, published in JAMA Internal Medicine and JAMA Neurology, monitored 78,500 adults with wearable trackers—making these the largest studies to objectively track step count in relation to health outcomes.The researchers from the University of Sydney, Australia and University of Southern Denmark found lowered risk of dementia, heart disease, cancer and death are associated with achieving 10,000 steps a day. 

- However, a faster stepping pace like a power walk showed benefits above and beyond the number of steps achieved.“The take-home message here is that for protective health benefits people could not only ideally aim for 10,000 steps a day but also aim to walk faster,” said co-lead author Dr. Matthew Ahmadi, Research Fellow at the University of Sydney’s Charles Perkins Centre and Faculty of Medicine and Health.Key points:Every 2,000 steps lowered risk of premature death incrementally by 8 to 11 percent, up to approximately 10,000 steps a day.Similar associations were seen for cardiovascular disease and cancer incidence.A higher number of steps per day was associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia9,800 steps was the optimal dose linked to lower risk of dementia by 50 percent, however risk was reduced by 25 percent at as low as 3,800 steps a dayFeed a virus, starve a bacterial infection?Yale University, September 8, 2022A new study puts some old folk wisdom to “feed a cold and starve a fever” to the test. 

- In mouse models of disease, Yale researchers looked at the effects of providing nutrients during infection and found opposing effects depending on whether the infections were bacterial or viral.Mice with bacterial infections that were fed died, while those with viral infections who were fed lived.“We were surprised at how profound the effects of feeding were, both positive and negative,” says senior author Ruslan Medzhitov, David W. Wallace Professor of Immunobiology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Yale School of Medicine.In the first series of experiments, the investigators infected mice with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, which commonly causes food poisoning.

- The study excluded people who consumed high levels of quercetin in their normal diets.Older adults with regular activity routines are happier and do better on cognitive tests, study findsUniversity of Pittsburgh, September 12, 2022Older adults who consistently get up early and remain active throughout the day are happier and perform better on cognitive tests than those with irregular activity patterns, according to a new study led by University of Pittsburgh researchers.The findings, published online in JAMA Psychiatry, suggest that patterns of activity—not just activity intensity—are important for healthy aging and mental health.“There’s something about getting going early, staying active all day and following the same routine each day that seems to be protecting older adults,” said lead author Stephen Smagula, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at Pitt. 

- “What’s exciting about these findings is that activity patterns are under voluntary control, which means that making intentional changes to one’s daily routine could improve health and wellness.”To learn more about daily activity patterns in U.S.-based older adults and identify links with mental health and cognition, Smagula and his team recruited 1,800 senior citizens aged over 65. 

- Participants wore accelerometers—movement-detecting devices often found in smartphones and exercise trackers—on their wrists for seven days to measure activity, and they completed questionnaires to assess depression symptoms and cognitive function.The analysis showed that 37.6% of participants rose early in the morning, stayed active throughout the day and had consistent daily routines.Another group comprising 32.6% of participants similarly had consistent daily patterns but the participants were active for an average of just 13.4 hours each day because they rose later in the morning or settled down earlier in the evening. 

- “It’s a simple message that has the potential to make a real contribution to public health.”After twelve weeks, Parretti and her team measured weight loss between the two groups – finding that participants who were instructed to consume 500 ml of water 30 min before main meals lost 1.3 kg more than the comparator group.According to the findings, 27% of those in the preloading intervention group lost more than 5% of their body weight during the 12 week trial, while only 5% in the comparator group lost the same amount.Exercise hormone halts Parkinson’s disease symptoms in mouse studyJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine, September 12, 2022Researchers from Johns Hopkins Medicine and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston have shown that a hormone secreted into the blood during endurance, or aerobic, exercise reduces levels of a protein linked to Parkinson’s disease and halts movement problems in mice.If confirmed in additional laboratory research and clinical trials, the researchers’ study in mice engineered to have Parkinson’s disease symptoms could pave the way for a Parkinson’s disease therapy based on the hormone irisin.In the past decade, other laboratories have found that exercise elevates levels of irisin, and there is interest in looking into the connection between irisin and Alzheimer’s disease as well as Parkinson’s disease.In the laboratory model, the researchers found that irisin prevented the accumulation of alpha synuclein clumps and its associated brain cell death.Additional studies of brain cells among the mice given irisin showed that the exercise hormone lowered levels of Parkinson’s disease-related alpha synuclein between 50% and 80%. 

- The research team demonstrated that irisin also speeds up the transport and degradation of alpha synuclein via fluid-filled sacs called lysosomes in brain cells.Common antidepressant may change brainWake Forest Baptist Medical Center, September 4, 2022A commonly prescribed antidepressant may alter brain structures in depressed and non-depressed individuals in very different ways, according to new research at Wake Forest Baptist MedicalCenter.The study – conducted in nonhuman primates with brain structures and functions similar to those of humans – found that the antidepressant sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) marketed as Zoloft, significantly increased the volume of one brain region in depressed subjects but decreased the volume of two brain areas in non-depressed subjects.In the study, 41 middle-aged female monkeys were fed a diet formulated to replicate that consumed by many Americans for 18 months, during which time depressive behavior in the animals was recorded. 

- This treatment regimen is analogous to a human taking an antidepressant for approximately five years.MRI images taken at the end of the treatment phase revealed that in depressed subjects the drug significantly increased the volume of one region of the brain, the anterior cingulate cortex, while decreasing the volume of this same region and the hippocampus in non-depressed subjects. 

- A new study adds evidence that meal timing may affect mental health, including levels of depression- and anxiety-related mood. 

- Investigators from Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham health care system, designed a study that simulated night work and then tested the effects of daytime and nighttime eating versus daytime eating only. 

- Results are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.“Our findings provide evidence for the timing of food intake as a novel strategy to potentially minimize mood vulnerability in individuals experiencing circadian misalignment, such as people engaged in shift work, experiencing jet lag, or suffering from circadian rhythm disorders,” said co-corresponding author Frank A. J. L. Scheer, Ph.D., Director of the Medical Chronobiology Program in the Brigham’s Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders.The team found that meal timing significantly affected the participants’ mood levels. 

- Participants with a greater degree of circadian misalignment experienced more depression- and anxiety-like mood.“Meal timing is emerging as an important aspect of nutrition that may influence physical health,” said Chellappa. 

- “But the causal role of the timing of food intake on mental health remains to be tested. 

- Future studies are required to establish if changes in meal timing can help individuals experiencing depressive and anxiety/anxiety-related disorders.”

- In addition to her clinical practice Kat has been active in medical activism to improve our broken healthcare system. 

- Kat is an active member in several medical and civic organizations including the American Academy of Physicians and Surgeons and the American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians. 

- She is on the Steering Committee of World Council for Health, a global network of over 130 organizations in 40 countries taking a lead in addressing the failures of government health ministries failures in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. 

- ahe has testified in various health committees in the USA and internationally, including giving testimony at the FDA against the scientific rationale to vaccinate children with the Covid vaccines and boosters. 

- The results of the study appear in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.“Population studies have consistently supported a protective role of nuts against cardiometabolic disorders such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and we know that inflammation is a key process in the development of these diseases,” said corresponding author Ying Bao, MD, ScD, an epidemiologist in BWH’s Channing Division of Network Medicine. 

- In the current study, the research team performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Nurses’ Health Study, which includes more than 120,000 female registered nurses, and from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, which includes more than 50,000 male health professionals. 

- They measured three well-established biomarkers of inflammation: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2).After adjusting for age, medical history, lifestyle and other variables, they found that participants who had consumed five or more servings of nuts per week had lower levels of CRP and IL6 than those who never or almost never ate nuts. 

- Researchers have not yet determined which of these components, or if the combination of all of them, may offer protection against inflammation, but Bao and her colleagues are interested in exploring this further through clinical trials that would regulate and monitor diet.“Much remains unknown about how our diet influences inflammation and, in turn, our risk of disease,” said Bao. 

- “But our study supports an overall healthful role for nuts in the diet and suggests reducing inflammation as a potential mechanism that may help explain the benefits of nuts on cardiometabolic diseases.”Blueberry extract could help fight gum disease and reduce antibiotic useLaval University (Quebec), September 2, 2022Gum disease is a common condition among adults that occurs when bacteria form biofilms or plaques on teeth, and consequently the gums become inflamed. 

- But recently, researchers have started looking at natural antibacterial compounds to treat gum disease. 

- It also blocked a molecular pathway involved in inflammation, a key part of gum disease. 

- In the modern world in which we live, in order to curb obesity it may make sense for dietary guidelines to advise eating less meat, as well as eating less sugar,” he says.Study suggests possible link between artificial sweeteners and heart diseaseFrench National Institute for Health and Medical Research, September 7, 2022A large study of French adults published by The BMJ today suggests a potential direct association between higher artificial sweetener consumption and increased cardiovascular disease risk, including heart attack and stroke.The findings indicate that these food additives, consumed daily by millions of people and present in thousands of foods and drinks, should not be considered a healthy and safe alternative to sugar, in line with the current position of several health agencies.Artificial sweeteners are widely used as no- or low-calorie alternatives to sugar. 

- They represent a $7.2 billion (£5900m; €7000m) global market and are found in thousands of products worldwide, particularly ultra-processed foods such as artificially sweetened drinks, some snacks, and low calorie ready meals.Several studies have linked consumption of artificial sweeteners or artificially sweetened beverages (ASB) to weight gain, high blood pressure, and inflammation.To investigate this further, a team of researchers at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) and colleagues drew on data for 103,388 participants (average age 42 years; 80% female) of the web-based NutriNet-Santé study, launched in France in 2009 to investigate relations between nutrition and health.Dietary intakes and consumption of artificial sweeteners were assessed by repeated 24-hour dietary records and a range of potentially influential health, lifestyle, and sociodemographic factors were taken into account.A total of 37% of participants consumed artificial sweeteners, with an average intake of 42.46 mg/day, which corresponds to approximately one individual packet of table top sweetener or 100 mL of diet soda.The researchers found that total artificial sweetener intake was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (absolute rate 346 per 100,000 person years in higher consumers and 314 per 100,000 person years in non-consumers).Artificial sweeteners were more particularly associated with cerebrovascular disease risk (absolute rates 195 and 150 per 100,000 person-years in higher and non-consumers, respectively).Aspartame intake was associated with increased risk of cerebrovascular events (186 and 151 per 100,000 person-years in higher and non-consumers, respectively), while acesulfame potassium and sucralose were associated with increased coronary heart disease risk (acesulfame potassium: 167 and 164 per 100,000 person-years; sucralose: 271 and 161 per 100,000 person-years in higher and non-consumers, respectively).Your soap and toothpaste could be messing with your microbiomeUniversity of Chicago, September 2, 2022Antimicrobial chemicals found in common household products could be wreaking havoc with people’s guts, according to a research paper out this week in the journal Science.Triclosan is an antibacterial compound used in soaps, detergent and toothpaste, as well as toys and plastics. 

- )Now, there are growing concerns about the possible negative effects of the chemical on human health and the environment. 

- The chemical has also been found in more than half of freshwater streams in the US.Disturbing the human microbiome has been “linked to a wide array of diseases and metabolic disorders, including obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and behavioral and metabolic disorders,” wrote the paper’s authors, Alyson L Yee and Jack A Gilbert.Yee and Gilbert also suggested that exposure to triclosan could be even more detrimental to the health of developing fetuses and newborns than to adults. 

- The research, appearing in the ACS journal Environmental Science & Technology, is the first epidemiological study on non-work-related exposure to phthalates to provide evidence for the possible link among a general population.Out of concern over the potential health effects of phthalates, the U.S. has banned six of these substances from use in certain products made for young children. 

- But many are still included as ingredients in paints, medical tubes, vinyl flooring, soaps, shampoos and other items. 

- Research on phthalates has shown that long-term exposure to low levels of some of these compounds harms lab animals’ health and can increase their risk for pregnancy loss. 

- “The butyric acid regulates immune function in the gut, suppresses chronic inflammation and may also help to cause cancer cells to self-destruct.”Boosting physical activity and curbing sitting time are highly likely to lower breast cancer riskBreast Cancer Association Consortium (UK), September 6, 2022Boosting physical activity levels and curbing sitting time are highly likely to lower breast cancer risk, finds research designed to strengthen proof of causation and published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.The findings were generally consistent across all types and stages of the disease, reveals the Mendelian randomization study, prompting the researchers to recommend a stronger focus on exercise as a way of warding off breast cancer.Mendelian randomization is a technique that uses genetic variants as proxies for a particular risk factor—in this case lifelong physical activity levels/sedentary behavior—to obtain genetic evidence in support of a causal relationship.Observational studies show that physical inactivity and sedentary behavior are linked to higher breast cancer risk, but proving they cause breast cancer is another matter.The researchers included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry: 69, 838 of them had tumors that had spread locally (invasive); 6667 had tumors that hadn’t yet done so (in situ); and a comparison group of 54,452 women didn’t have breast cancer.Researchers estimated overall breast cancer risk, according to whether the women had or hadn’t gone through the menopause; and by cancer type (positive for estrogen or progesterone, or HER-2, or positive/negative for all 3 hormones), stage (size and extent of tumor spread), and grade (degree of tumor cell abnormality).These case-control groups comprised: 23,999 pre/peri-menopausal women with invasive breast cancer and 17,686 women without; 45,839 postmenopausal women with breast cancer and 36,766 without.Analysis of the data showed that a higher overall level of genetically predicted physical activity was associated with a 41% lower risk of invasive breast cancer, and this was largely irrespective of menopausal status, tumor type, stage, or grade.Similarly, genetically predicted vigorous physical activity on 3 or more days of the week was associated with a 38% lower risk of breast cancer, compared with no self-reported vigorous activity. 

- Our concept of neuroplasticity must be extended, because mental activity seems to induce learning effects similar to active stimulation and physical training,” Dinse suggests.Elderberry extract may improve obesity inflammationUniversity of Connecticut , September 1, 2022Black elderberry extract may improve obesity-related metabolic disturbances like triglyceride (TAG) levels, inflammation and insulin resistance, research in mice finds.The researchers from the University of Connecticut in the US said dietary anthocyanins had been shown to reduce inflammation in animal models and to improve obesity-related complications – and black elderberry (Sambucus nigra) was one of the richest sources of these types of flavonoids.“Overall, black elderberry extract appeared to attenuate systemic inflammation and insulin resistance that occurs with diet-induced obesity in this mouse model, but further research is warranted on black elderberry consumption and effects in humans,” they wrote in the British Journal of Nutrition.Mice were fed either a low-fat diet, high-fat lard-based diet, a high-fat diet with 0.25% of the extract or a high-fat with 1.25% of the extract for a period of 16 weeks.The black elderberry extracts amounted to an anthocyanin dose of 20–40 mg per kg of body weight for the 0.25% group and 100–200 mg for the 1.25% group.After 16 weeks both extract groups had significantly lower liver weights, serum TAG and serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 – a serum marker linked to cardiovascular disease and diabetes – compared to the group given the high fat diet alone.Liver weights were about 13% lower in both extract groups compared to the group given the high fat diet alone.“Obese individuals have shortened life expectancies; however, they do not typically die of obesity itself but rather obesity-related comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and certain types of cancers,” they said.They said inflammation as a result of adipose fat and excessive accumulation of ectopic lipid in tissues was thought to be a key underlying cause of these obesity-related comorbidities, meaning methods that target and lower inflammation could be effective at preventing obesity-related conditions.First Ground Breaking Study Shows How Rhodiola Rosea Protects People From Viral InfectionsAppalachian State University August 26, 2022Also known as arctic root or golden root, Rhodiola Rosea has already been clinically shown to stimulate serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine activity, and support healthy neurotransmitter balance, but human trials have now shown the the herb protects against viral infection.A 2002 review in HerbalGram, the journal of the American Botanical Council, reported that numerous studies of rhodiola in both humans and animals have indicated that it helps prevent fatigue, stress, and the damaging effects of oxygen deprivation. 

- The reviewers considered studies that all had study designs rated as moderate to good quality, and the analysis of their combined data concluded that rhodiola might have beneficial effects on physical performance, mental performance, and certain mental health conditions.Nieman’s study “Rhodiola rosea exerts antiviral activity in athletes following a competitive marathon race,” which was published July 31 in Frontiers in Nutrition, is the first to show anti-viral activity.In his study, 48 marathon runners participating in the 2012 Thunder Road Marathon in Charlotte were randomly divided into two groups that ingested either 600 milligrams of Rhodiola rosea or a placebo for a month before the race. 

- This is the finding of a recent study by the Lise Meitner Group for Environmental Neuroscience at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, published in Molecular Psychiatry.Living in a city is a well-known risk factor for developing a mental disorder, while living close to nature is largely beneficial for mental health and the brain. 

- The results of the study revealed that activity in the amygdala decreased after the walk in nature, suggesting that nature elicits beneficial effects on brain regions related to stress.“The results support the previously assumed positive relationship between nature and brain health, but this is the first study to prove the causal link. 

- This contributes to the understanding of how our physical living environment affects brain and mental health. 

- Even a short exposure to nature decreases amygdala activity, suggesting that a walk in nature could serve as a preventive measure against developing mental health problems and buffering the potentially disadvantageous impact of the city on the brain. 

- "Considering that abdominal arterial aneurysms are caused by inflammation and the degradation of elastin components in the arterial wall, we thought drinking green tea may show promise for treatment. 

- "The results confirmed that EGCG blocked AAA progression in the rat model by preserving the aortic thickness and elastin content through regeneration of elastin.“Regular green tea consumption might be advantageous for patients with a small AAA or as a prophylactic strategy for AAA,” the team suggested.Lower potassium intake linked to premature mortality riskUniversity of California at Irvine, September 2 2022.A study reported on August 26, 2022, in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found a higher risk of dying during a median 5.8 to 7.8-year follow-up period in association with a lower intake of potassium. 

- leading to malignant arrhythmias and mortality.”The investigation included 37,893 continuous participants in the National Health and Nutrition Education Survey (NHANES, 1999–2014) whose potassium intake was calculated from 24-hour dietary recall interviews. 

- “Further studies are needed to elucidate pathways linking potassium intake and co-existing dietary factors with survival in populations with and without chronic kidney disease.”People who lack compassion for the environment are also less emotional in generalUniversity of Michigan, September 2, 2022People who respond less emotionally to images of damage to the environment are also less emotional and empathic in general, according to a new University of Michigan study.Differences in political ideology can limit policy adjustments that address climate change. 

- "Given that our sense of risk and decisions are strongly guided by emotions, more impassive people are less inclined to dedicate resources to this slowly building crisis," she said.Amino acid supplements may boost vascular endothelial function in older adults: StudyUniversity of Alabama, August 28, 2022A combination of HMB (a metabolite of leucine), glutamine and arginine may improve vascular function and blood flow in older people, says a new study.Scientists from the University of Alabama report that a supplement containing HMB (beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate), glutamine and arginine (Juven by Abbott Nutrition) increased flow-mediated dilation (FMD - a measure of blood flow and vascular health) by 27%, whereas no changes were observed in the placebo group.However, the researchers did not observe any changes to markers of inflammation, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)“Our results indicate that 6 months of dietary supplementation with HMB, glutamine and arginine had a positive impact on vascular endothelial function in older adults,” wrote the researchers, led by Dr Amy Ellis in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition . 

- “These results are clinically relevant because reduced endothelial-dependent vasodilation is a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseasesBreak A Sweat For Your Brain: Exercise Protects Aging SynapsesUniversity of California at San Francisco, September 2, 2022Scientists at UC San Francisco have found that the brains of physically active elderly adults contain more of a specific type of protein known to enhance the connections between neurons and help maintain healthy cognition. 

- Blood samples collected before and after treatment were evaluated for red blood cell EPA and DHA, the Omega-3 Index and other factors.Omega-3 values increased in both the EPA/DHA and EPA only groups, while the placebo group showed little change. 

- Social functioning as evaluated by a general health survey significantly improved with EPA/DHA supplementation and showed a tendency toward improvement in the high EPA group. 

- "Generally, we think of the function of omega-3s as preventative rather than as treatment. 

- If used as treatment, the dose must be fairly high (4 grams is a typical 'drug' dose) and blood levels must be measured.”Groundbreaking Study Shows Fasting Can Slow Aging, Rebuild Immune SystemUniversity of Southern California, August 28, 2022Cutting-edge research reveals that occasionally adopting a diet that mimics the effects of fasting may provide dramatic health benefits.“Fasting flips a regenerative switch essentially regenerating the entire immune system. 

- “It’s not a typical diet because it isn’t something you need to stay on.”“If the results remain as positive as the current ones, I believe this FMD will represent the first safe and effective intervention to promote positive changes associated with longevity and health span, which can be recommended by a physician,” Longo told USC News.

- The goal of this study was to determine if ARHL could be reduced in a rat model by administering a combination of antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E acting as free radical scavengers along with Mg, a known powerful cochlear vasodilator (ACEMg). 

- "According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "These findings indicate that oral ACEMg may provide an effective adjuvant therapeutic intervention for the treatment of ARHL, delaying the progression of hearing impairment associated with age. 

- "Scientists use 'sleep age' to infer long-term healthStanford University, September 1, 2022Sleep age is a projected age that correlates to one's health based on their quality of sleep. 

- Their goal was to develop a system that assigns one's sleep age and, using machine learning, identifies the variations in sleep most closely linked to mortality.I spoke with Mignot, who has studied sleep for 30 years, about why sleep age is important, how it's calculated and what the study's findings imply about our health.Why study sleep age?When you sleep, you're disconnected from sensory inputs—you're, ideally, not being bothered by the noisy external world or bright lights.During sleep, it's not just the brain that's going through an automatic program, but heart rate and breathing also change, and variations in these can be early predictors of a health disturbance. 

- For example, about five or 10 years before other symptoms appear in Parkinson's disease patients, a specific sleep disturbance occurs during which the patient violently acts out dreams, shouts or punches into a wall.What was the most important finding from the study?Our main finding was that sleep fragmentation—when people wake up multiple times throughout the night for less than a minute without remembering it—was the strongest predictor of mortality. 

- This is different from a person realizing they were waking up, which happens during sleep disorders such as insomnia.Determining why sleep fragmentation is so detrimental to health is something we plan to study in the future.Can we measure our own sleep age? 

- A Marker of Shedding?Why You Should Have FaithPlandemic – IndoctrinationGreen tea compound shows promise for treating rheumatoid arthritisWashington State University August 25, 2022A compound found in green tea could be an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, according to the results of a new study.Green tea being poured into a cup] EGCG – a compound found in green tea – could help treat rheumatoid arthritis, new research suggests. 

- In the journal Arthritis and Rheumatology, researchers from Washington State University (WSU) in Spokane reveal how the compound – called epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) – reduced ankle swelling in a mouse model of the disease. 

- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease that affects the joints of the body, most commonly the joints of the hands, feet, wrists, elbows knees and ankles. 

- EGCG targets key signaling protein to reduce RA inflammation EGCG is a chemical compound that belongs to a class of flavanols known as catechins.After giving EGCG to mouse models of RA for 10 days, the team noticed that treatment with the compound led to a significant reduction in ankle swelling. 

- What is more, the team says that EGCG reduced inflammation in RA without interfering with other cellular functions – unlike some current medications for the disease. 

- According to Ahmed, their study suggests the green tea compound may be highly effective against RA.Antioxidant-rich pomegranate juice may aid blood sugar management for diabetics: Human dataJordan University of Science and Technology, August 20, 2022Daily consumption of pomegranate juice may help control blood sugar levels in type-2 diabetics, as well as improving the function of beta cells in the pancreas, say data from a human trial.Scientists from the Jordan University of Science and Technology report that pomegranate juice at a dose of 1.5 mL per kg of body weight (or 105 mL for a 70 kg human) was associated with reductions in fasting glucose levels in type-2 diabetics.“Studying the effects of pomegranate consumption (in a juice form) on the reduction of blood glucose levels in type-2 diabetes patients could lead to a dietary approach to control this disease,” they added. 

- “Since there are many herbs and fruits that are easily available and of value in controlling this disease, this study may contribute to a better understanding and improved management of type 2 diabetes by the individual.”To investigate this, they recruited 85 people with type-2 diabetes and assigned them to receive 1.5 mL of the juice per kg of body weight. 

- However, this result was an average for the whole cohort and about 20% of the participants did not experience this benefit.Going with the flow: Study shows canals and rivers help boost your moodKing’s College London, August 31, 2022Researchers report that the combination of blue and green space with wildlife, has a greater impact on well-being than spending time in an environment that is characterized by only green space.The researchers used Urban Mind, a smartphone-based app, to collect thousands of real time audits about participants’ location and mental well-being.Results from this first of its kind study showed positive associations between visits to canals and rivers and mental well-being, as well as a positive experience for feelings of safety and social inclusion relative to all other types of environments (such as indoors, or outside in an urban environment, or near green spaces).Andrea Mechelli, Professor of Early Intervention in Mental Health, King’s College London, said, “Canals and rivers contain not only water but also an abundance of trees and plants, which means their capacity to improve mental well-being is likely to be due to the multiple benefits associated with both green and blue spaces. 

- Taken collectively, these findings provide an evidence base for what we thought about water and well-being and support the proposal that visits to canals and rivers could become part of social prescribing schemes, playing a role in supporting mental health.”The study found that visiting canals and rivers was associated with a greater improvement in mental well-being, and this relationship was still present when accounting for individual variation due to age, gender, education, ethnicity, and a diagnosis of a mental health condition. 

- People also reported continued improvements in their mental well-being for up to 24 hours after the visit had taken place.”The powerful mix of blue, green and wildlife-rich space shows that although built for industry, repurposed canals are actually amongst our most important places of health and well-being in our towns and cities.Men, people over 65 sleep better when they have access to natureUniversity of Illinois College of Agricultural, August 24, 2022Men and persons age 65 and older who have access to natural surroundings, whether it’s the green space of a nearby park or a sandy beach and an ocean view, report sleeping better, according to a new University of Illinois study published in Preventive Medicine.In the study, Grigsby-Toussaint worked with both U of I researchers and scientists from the New York University School of Medicine. 

- And males and females 65 and over found nature to be a potent sleep aid, she added.Grigsby-Toussaint noted that living near green landscapes is associated with higher levels of physical activity and that exercise in turn predicts beneficial sleep patterns.But men appeared to benefit much more from their natural surroundings. 

- They did not find the same association in women.“We started out thinking that colorectal cancer could be the cancer most impacted by diet compared to other cancer types,” said Lu Wang, the study’s lead author and a postdoctoral fellow at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts. 

- “We found an inverse association between ultra-processed dairy foods like yogurt and colorectal cancer risk among women,” said co-senior author Fang Fang Zhang, a cancer epidemiologist and interim chair of the Division of Nutrition Epidemiology and Data Science at the Friedman School.Overall, there was not a link between ultra-processed food consumption and colorectal cancer risk among women. 

- It’s possible that the composition of the ultra-processed foods consumed by women could be different than that from men.“Foods like yogurt can potentially counteract the harmful impacts of other types of ultra-processed foods in women,” Zhang said.8 Benefits of Pine Bark Extract for Your BrainGreenMedInfo, August 31, 2022Our brains can be harmed by many factors such as disease, stress from the environment, physical injuries or natural aging but pine bark extract may be one key to a healthier brainPine bark extract (PE), trade name Pycnogenol (pronounced “pig-nah-gen-all”), has many beneficial properties such as being anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective. 

- [i]In a study of gerbils, pine bark extract was administered at 100 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) once a day for seven days before the brain was submitted to a brain ischemic injury.The PE treatment markedly inhibited the death of neurons in the brain, significantly decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines — interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor α — and showed a strong activation effect on anti-inflammatory cytokines of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 13 (IL-13).

- “The magnesium depletion score (MDS) index was recently proposed as a method of measuring magnesium shortage that took into consideration the pathophysiological factors influencing the kidneys’ reabsorption capability and was proven to be more sensitive and reliable than other clinical predictors of magnesium,” Chen and associates wrote.The study utilized data obtained from 4,308 men and women enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2018. 

- A high amount of magnesium intake was associated with a reduced risk of diabetic retinopathy when the magnesium depletion score was at a middle level or lower.“Our research indicates that magnesium deficiency predicts a higher risk of diabetic retinopathy in diabetic individuals and that magnesium supplementation may reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy,” they concluded.Exercise Outweighs Genetics When It Comes To Longer LifeUniversity of California at San Diego, August 26, 2022If living into your 90s seems to run in the family, don’t just assume that means you will too. 

- Our genetics make us who we are, but new research from the University of California, San Diego finds exercise trumps genes when it comes to promoting a longer life.You don’t need a medical degree to know that forgoing physical activity in favor of stagnation isn’t the wisest choice for your health and longevity. 

- In 2012, as part of the Women’s Health Initiative Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health study (OPACH), study authors began keeping track of the physical activity habits among 5,446 older U.S. women (ages 63 or older). 

- Importantly, this observed connection between exercise and a longer life remained consistent even among women determined to have different levels of genetic predisposition for longevity.“Our study showed that, even if you aren’t likely to live long based on your genes, you can still extend your lifespan by engaging in positive lifestyle behaviors such as regular exercise and sitting less,” explains senior study author Aladdin H. Shadyab, Ph.D., assistant professor at the Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science at UC San Diego. 

- “Conversely, even if your genes predispose you to a long life, remaining physically active is still important to achieve longevity.”Guarana found to have higher antioxidant potential than green teaUniversity of São Paulo's Public Health School (Brazil), August 25, 2022The millions of people who consume green tea all over the world benefit from the catechins it contains. 

- Catechins are a class of chemical compounds with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, among other healthy ingredients.Researchers at the University of São Paulo's Public Health School (FSP-USP) have discovered that guarana (Paullinia cupana) is a worthy competitor, at least as far as catechins are concerned: the seeds of the tropical shrub, used in fizzy drinks that are among the most popular in Brazil, as well as in over-the-counter supplements, contain more than ten times the amount of catechins found in green tea.A clinical trial with healthy human volunteers has demonstrated that guarana is a rich source of catechins, which, when properly absorbed, reduce the oxidative stress associated with the development of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders, as well as diabetes, cancer, inflammation and premature aging due to cell death, among other conditions harmful to health and wellbeing.The month-long study was conducted in two stages. 

- After selecting volunteers who were healthy but slightly overweight and with a moderately elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, the researchers measured baseline parameters on the first day and evaluated the same items again on day 15 after a the implementation of a controlled diet. 

- When oxidized, however, LDL causes atherosclerosis and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. 

- "Moreover, she went on, the guarana catechins strengthened the cells' native anti-oxidant enzymes, especially glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, which combine to convert superoxide into peroxide and finally into water, protecting cells from the oxidative damage caused by their own metabolism of outside factors.The tests showed increased glutathione peroxidase and catalase activity both shortly after guarana ingestion and on the following day.Study links caesareans and cardiovascular riskJames Cook University (New Zealand), August 25, 2022A new Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health study has found Australian children who were born via cesarean section (C-section) have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity, and it's sparked a call to limit the increasingly popular practice"C-section births have risen across the world with a disproportionately higher rate in developed countries. 

- In Australia, the C-section birth rate has increased from 18.5% in 1990 to 36% in 2019 and nearly half of Australian babies are projected to be cesarean born by 2045," said Dr. Begum.She said the study found a relationship between C-section births and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in children. 

- This altered microbial ecosystem hampers the 'gut-brain axis' and releases some pathogenic toxins that cause metabolic damage," said Dr. Begum.She said it was also possible the fetal stress from physiological or pharmacological induction of labor during a C-section could also have an effect.Black tea drinkers live longerNational Institutes of Health, August 29 2022.The Annals of Internal Medicine reported a lower risk of dying from any cause during a median follow-up period of 11.2 years among men and women who regularly drank black tea in comparison with those who did not consume the beverage.The study included 498,03 participants in the UK Biobank, a prospective study of people residing in the United Kingdom. 

- Tea intake was associated with decreased risks of death from cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease and stroke.“In this study of nearly 500,000 participants in the UK Biobank where black tea drinking was common, higher tea intake was associated with modestly lower risk for all-cause mortality and mortality from all cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and stroke, with lower risks seen for drinking 2 or more cups per day,” Maki Inoue-Choi, PhD, and colleagues at the NIH concluded. 

- The researchers assessed how the mothers' nutrition affected epigenetic changes (or DNA methylation) of IGF2, a gene involved in fetal development and the brain development of areas implicated in ADHD - the cerebellum and hippocampus. 

- Notably, DNA methylation of IGF2 had previously been found in children of mothers who were exposed to famine in the Netherlands during World War II.The researchers from King's and Bristol found that poor prenatal nutrition, comprising high fat and sugar diets of processed food and confectionary, was associated with higher IGF2 methylation in children with early onset conduct problems and those with low conduct problems.Higher IGF2 methylation was also associated with higher ADHD symptoms between the ages of 7 and 13, but only for children who showed an early onset of conduct problems.Dr Edward Barker from King's College London said: 'Our finding that poor prenatal nutrition was associated with higher IGF2 methylation highlights the critical importance of a healthy diet during pregnancy.

- Patients with hypertension treated with acupuncture experienced drops in their blood pressure that lasted up to a month and a half, researchers with the Susan Samueli Center for Integrative Medicine have found.Their work is the first to scientifically confirm that this ancient Chinese practice is beneficial in treating mild to moderate hypertension, and it indicates that regular use could help people control their blood pressure and lessen their risk of stroke and heart disease.“This clinical study is the culmination of more than a decade of bench research in this area,” said Dr. John Longhurst, a University of California, Irvine cardiologist and former director of the Samueli Center. 

- “By using Western scientific rigor to validate an ancient Eastern therapy, we feel we have integrated Chinese and Western medicine and provided a beneficial guideline for treating a disease that affects millions in the U.S.”Longhurst and his UCI colleagues Dr. Peng Li and Stephanie Tjen-A-Looi conducted tests on 65 hypertensive patients who were not receiving any hypertension medication. 

- In addition, the electroacupuncture decreased aldosterone (22 percent), a hormone that regulates electrolytes.No consequential blood pressure changes were found in the group of 32 who received electroacupuncture at other acupoints along the forearm and lower leg.Although the blood pressure reductions in the first cohort were relatively small – mostly in the 4-to-13-mmHg range – the researchers noted that they were clinically meaningful and that the technique could be especially useful in treating systolic hypertension in patients over 60.“Because electroacupuncture decreases both peak and average systolic blood pressure over 24 hours, this therapy may decrease the risk for stroke, peripheral artery disease, heart failure and myocardial infarction in hypertensive patients,” Longhurst said.Vitamin C may encourage blood cancer stem cells to dieNew York University Langone Health. 

- This is the finding of a study led by researchers from Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Health, and published online in the journal Cell.Certain genetic changes are known to reduce the ability of an enzyme called TET2 to encourage stem cells to become mature blood cells, which eventually die, in many patients with certain kinds of leukemia, say the authors. 

- The new study found that vitamin C activated TET2 function in mice engineered to be deficient in the enzyme.“We’re excited by the prospect that high-dose vitamin C might become a safe treatment for blood diseases caused by TET2-deficient leukemia stem cells, most likely in combination with other targeted therapies,” says corresponding study author Benjamin G. Neel, MD, PhD, professor in the Department of Medicine and director of the Perlmutter Cancer Center.Changes in the genetic code (mutations) that reduce TET2 function are found in 10 percent of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 30 percent of those with a form of pre-leukemia called myelodysplastic syndrome, and in nearly 50 percent of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. 

- By promoting DNA demethylation, high-dose vitamin C treatment induced stem cells to mature, and also suppressed the growth of leukemia cancer stem cells from human patients implanted in mice.“Interestingly, we also found that vitamin C treatment had an effect on leukemic stem cells that resembled damage to their DNA,” says first study author Luisa Cimmino, PhD, an assistant professor in the Department of Pathology at NYU Langone Health. 

- The results also suggest that vitamin C might drive leukemic stem cells without TET2 mutations toward death, says Cimmino, given that it turns up any TET2 activity normally in place.“Our team is working to systematically identify genetic changes that contribute to risk for leukemia in significant groups of patients,” says corresponding author Iannis Aifantis, PhD, professor and chair of the Department of Pathology at NYU Langone Health. 

- “This study adds the targeting of abnormal TET2-driven DNA demethylation to our list of potential new treatment approaches.”Burnt out? 

- Rhodiola rosea supplements may help, says new studyWein University Medical School (Austria), 18-Aug-2022Daily supplements containing Rhodiola rosea extract may improve the symptoms of burnout, suggests data from the first trial to examine the effects of the botanical extract on this modern day condition.Results of the open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial provide “an encouraging basis” for future clinical trials to study if R. rosea extract can indeed help people suffering from burnout, which is reported to be an increasing burden to people and economies in the Western world.“Most of the outcome variables assessed in this trial demonstrated relevant improvement over time with considerable changes already being detectable after the first week of R. rosea administration,” wrote Siegfried Kasper from the Medical University of Vienna in Austria and Angelika Dienel from Dr Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co. in Germany in Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment .Despite being the first to specifically examine the effects of R. rosea in burnout, the results are in-line with previously reported benefits of the root extract, which is primary used for stress, mental and physical fatigue, depression, and to boost energy.Study detailsFor the new study, Kasper and Dienel recruited 118 men and women aged between 30 and 60 suffering from symptoms of burnout. 

- Participants who received a placebo experienced no significant changes in these areas.“The primary finding in the present study was that oral supplementation of resveratrol for 12 weeks decreased CAVI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,” authors Haruki Imamura, MD, and colleagues at Toho University Sakura Medical Center in Japan write. 

- “However, a large-scale cohort study is required to validate the present findings.”Research reveals how physical exercise protects the heartThrough experiments with rats and cells, a study shows that aerobic training reactivates system that helps rid heart cells of dysfunctional mitochondria.University of São Paulo (Brazil), August 18, 2022Regular exercise is considered an important form of treatment for heart failure, a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs.The benefits of exercise range from prevention of cachexia -severe loss of weight and muscle mass- and control of arterial blood pressure to improved cardiac function, postponing a degenerative process that causes progressive heart cell death. 

- About 70% of heart failure patients die from the condition within five years.A study by the University of São Paulo (USP) in Brazil, published recently in the journal Autophagy, helps to elucidate part of the mechanism whereby aerobic exercise protects the sick heart.“Basically, we discovered that aerobic training facilitates the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria from heart cells,” said Julio Cesar Batista Ferreira, a professor at the Biomedical Science Institute (ICB-USP) and principal investigator for the project which was supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Mitochondria are the organelles in charge of providing energy to cells. 

- “The removal of dysfunctional mitochondria increases the supply of ATP [adenosine triphosphate, the molecule that stores energy for the cell] and reduces the production of toxic molecules, such as oxygen free radicals and reactive aldehydes, an excess of which damages the cell structure,” he added.In a previous study, published in PLOS ONE, the group showed through experiments with rats that aerobic training reactivates the proteasome, an intracellular complex responsible for cleansing cells of damaged proteins.The results also showed that proteasome activity in the heart of a patient with heart failure decreases by more than 50% and that, as a result, highly reactive proteins build up in the cytoplasm, where they interact with other structures and cause heart cell death.Dietary management of OCD: Study links metabolism and vitamin D status to disease severityOrdu University (Turkey), August 20, 2022One carbon metabolism that includes vitamin B12 and homocysteine, plus vitamin D deficiency could all play a role in the onset of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), research suggests.The study, published in Psychiatry Research, investigated whether vitamin B12, homocysteine folic acid and vitamin D play a role in the cause (aetiology) of childhood OCD.Led by Erman Esnafoğlu from Ordu University, Turkey, the team noted that one carbon metabolism – which includes vitamin B12 and homocysteine – has been investigated in many psychiatric disorders, while vitamin D has also been considered to contribute in a variety of psychiatric disorders in recent years.“To the best of our knowledge the role of one carbon mechanism and vitamin D deficiency in children and adolescents with OCD has not yet been investigated,” wrote the Turkish team. 

- “For this reason we aimed to investigate serum vitamin B12, folic acid homocysteine and vitamin D levels in children and adolescents in this study.”Esnafoğlu and colleagues reported that lower levels of vitamin B12 and higher levels of homocysteine in were found in OCD patients – suggesting that one carbon metabolism plays a role in the onset of the condition.Furthermore, the team found that low vitamin D levels were linked to OCD, and that vitamin D status in patients had a negative correlation with disease severity.“This study has demonstrated that there is a significant decrease in vitamin B12 and vitamin D and a significant increase in homocysteine in children and adolescents with OCD,” said the team – noting that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for development of OCD.“The findings of this study demonstrated that vitamin B12 and vitamin D levels were significantly lower in patients compared to healthy controls, whereas homocysteine was higher in the patient group,” noted Esnafoğlu and colleagues. 

- Strawberries could help reduce harmful inflammation in the colonUniversity of Massachusetts, August 20, 202Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a set of painful conditions that can cause severe diarrhea and fatigue. 

- But now researchers report that a simple dietary intervention could mitigate colonic inflammation and improve gut health. 

- You may want to reconsider based on a new study that explored whether individuals who consume higher amounts of ultra-processed food have more adverse mental health symptoms.Researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Schmidt College of Medicine and collaborators explored a nationally representative sample of the United States population to determine if individuals who consume high amounts of ultra-processed foods report significantly more adverse mental health symptoms including depression, anxiety and mentally unhealthy days. 

- They measured mild depression, number of mental unhealthy days and number of anxious days in 10,359 adults 18 and older from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.Results of the study, published in the journal Public Health Nutrition, showed that individuals who consumed the most ultra-processed foods as compared with those who consumed the least amount had statistically significant increases in the adverse mental health symptoms of mild depression, "mentally unhealthy days" and "anxious days." 

- Findings from this study are generalizable to the entire U.S. as well as other Western countries with similar ultra-processed food intakes.Many types of leisure time activities may lower risk of death for older adultsNational Cancer Institute, August 25, 2022Older adults who participate weekly in many different types of leisure time activities, such as walking for exercise, jogging, swimming laps, or playing tennis, may have a lower risk of death from any cause, as well as death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, according to a new study led by researchers at the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.The findings suggest that it's important for older adults to engage in leisure time activities that they enjoy and can sustain, because many types of these activities may lower the risk of death, the authors wrote.Using data from 272,550 adults between the ages of 59 and 82 who had completed questionnaires about their leisure-time activities as part of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, the researchers looked at whether participating in equivalent amounts of seven different exercise and recreational activities—including running, cycling, swimming, other aerobic exercise, racquet sports, golf, and walking for exercise—was associated with lowered risk of death.The researchers found that achieving the recommended amount of physical activity per week through any combination of these activities was associated with a 13% lower risk of death from any cause compared with no participation in these activities. 

- Even people who did some recreational activity, though less than the recommended amount, had a 5% reduction in risk of death than those who did not participate in any of the activities studied.These activities were also associated with a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer. 

- Playing racquet sports was associated with the greatest reduction in risk of cardiovascular deaths (27% reduction), while running was associated with the greatest reduction in risk of cancer deaths (19% reduction).Avocado may resist the effects of leukemiaUniversity of Waterloo (Canada), August 19, 2022One of the many health benefits avocados offer is their ability to ward off cancer. 

- Approximately 90 percent of people with this type of cancer die within five years of diagnosis.In the in vitro study, Canadian researcher Paul Spagnuolo found that avocatin B fights AML by targeting leukemia stem cells – which are the root of the disease – without harming healthy, non-cancerous cells. 

- Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles conducted a review of studies on the potential health benefits of avocados and looked at evidence that specific avocado extracts can inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells and oral cancer cells. 

- They found that the active compounds in avocados make them potentially beneficial for preventing cancer.News addiction is linked to not only poor mental well-being but physical health too, new studyTexas Tech University, August 25, 2022People with an obsessive urge to constantly check the news are more likely to suffer from stress, anxiety, and physical ill health, finds a new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Health Communication.For many people, reading bad news can make us feel temporarily powerless and distressed.

- The mean age was 67.1 years.Intervention: Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 groups:Omega-3 fatty acid (1,000 mg/day; 460 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 380 mg docosahexaenoic acid) and vitamin D supplementation (2,000 IU/day)Omega-3 fatty acid (1,000 mg/day) and placeboVitamin D supplementation (2,000 IU/day) and placeboPlaceboKey FindingsIn older adults, supplementing with daily vitamin D (2,000 IU) for 5 years decreased the incidence of autoimmune disease by 22%. 

- Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation alone decreased incidence of autoimmune disease by 15% but was not statistically significant. 

- Omega-3 supplementation alone did appear to be more beneficial for prevention of autoimmune disease onset in those with a positive family history and also appeared to have more impact in the later years of the study.It does appear that vitamin D supplementation, with or without omega-3 supplementation, decreases the incidence of new-onset autoimmune disease in people aged more than 55 years. 

- The study did an excellent job ensuring regimen adherence with the use of biomarkers.Bitter Orange: Another Tool to Improve SleepAhvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences (Iran), August 13, 2022To determine whether inhalation of Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) daily over 4 weeks would improve the sleep of postmenopausal women. 

- Inclusion criteria were the ability to read and write, cessation of menses for 12 months or more, 5 or more on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire, no medical or mental disorder, available medical records, no alcohol, and no stressful events in the 6 months prior.Intervention: Participants placed 2 drops of oil on their forearm and inhaled the aroma from a distance of 30 cm away with normal breathing for 5 minutes twice daily (10 am and 10 pm). 

- The treatment group received 10% Citrus aurantium oil (mixed in odorless almond oil diluted with propylene glycol), while the control group received odorless almond oil, which was also diluted with propylene glycol. 

- It was found that the natural mixture was far more effective at soothing down coughs and throat irritation than the commercial preparation.This sparked other studies on the subject, and scientists came to the conclusion that the reason that pineapple juice is so effective for taming a cough is the presence of bromelain, an enzyme that has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which allow it to reduce irritation of the throat and thus relieve even persistent coughing.Also helpful is the fact that pineapple contains high amounts of vitamin C (another power antioxidant) as well as a wealth of vitamin A and minerals like magnesium, manganese and potassium, all of which help boost the immune system and make it easier for the body to fight off infections that cause coughs in the first place
DR. IRVING KIRSCH ON 60 MINUTES PROVING PLACEBOS WORK AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGSQatar: Killer Heat Cripples WorkersIndia on Fire: Dealing with the heatwave crisisHigher vitamin C levels associated with lower mortality risk during 16-year periodChinese Academy of Medical Sciences, August 20 2022A study reported in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health has uncovered an association between higher plasma vitamin C levels and a lower risk of mortality during more than 16 years of follow-up.The study included 473 men and 475 women between the ages of 53 and 84.Among subjects whose plasma vitamin C concentrations were among the top 25%, the adjusted risk of dying from any cause during follow-up was 25% lower than the risk experienced by subjects whose vitamin C levels were among the lowest quarter. 

- Those whose plasma vitamin C levels were among the highest 25% had an adjusted risk of dying from cancer or stroke that was 28% lower and a risk of dying from heart disease that was 35% lower than subjects whose levels were lowest.When subjects with low vitamin C levels (defined as 28 micromoles per liter or below) and normal levels (greater than 28 micromoles per liter) were compared, a normal level was associated with a 23% lower risk of premature mortality and a 38% lower risk of dying from heart disease, in comparison with low levels.As a possible reason for their findings, Shao-Ming Wang and colleagues note that oxidative stress is lowered by vitamin C. Oxidative stress can promote endothelial dysfunction that underlies heart disease by increasing inflammation and lipid peroxidation and decreasing nitric oxide availability. 

- Oxidative stress also causes DNA damage associated with cancer.Pomegranate-cocoa blend helps improve aging men’s symptomsShetty Hospital (India), August 19 2022.A study published  in the International Journal of Medical Science found benefits for supplementing with a combination of extracts of Punica granatum (pomegranate) fruit rind and Theobroma cocoa seed extracts in middle-aged men.Previous research that investigated the effects of a blend of extracts of pomegranate fruit rind and cocoa seed in young men resulted in increases in serum and free testosterone levels as well as muscle strength and size. 

- All participants were assigned to a program consisting of 30 minutes of walking per day for 5 days per week.At the end of the 7-week period, both doses of pomegranate-cocoa extracts were associated with significant improvement in aging males’ symptom scores, free and total testosterone levels, strength and perceived stress compared to the beginning of the study and to the placebo group.The authors concluded that pomegranate-cocoa “is a well-tolerated, safe, and effective nutraceutical blend that boosts sexual function, testosterone level, and psychological and general well-being in aging males.”Placebo effect demonstrates healing power of the mindHarvard Medical School, August 13, 2022Experts at Harvard Medical School advocate that the placebo effect be received with more positivity, rather than viewed as a deceptive or inaccurate measure designed to test health. 

- The university’s literature says that there is “evidence that some of the placebo effect is a favorable reaction to care and attention from people who patients believe can help ease their suffering and distress.” It goes on to say that the placebo effect “may be an integral part of good medical care and an ally that should be embraced by doctors and patients alike.”This paves the way for potential changes in how health is handled and, furthermore, reinforces the strength of the human mind to bring about healing and desired outcomes, health or otherwise.Awake within a dream: Lucid dreamers show greater insight in waking lifeUniversity of Lincoln (UK), August 12, 2022People who are aware they are asleep when they are dreaming have better than average problem-solving abilities, new research has discovered.Experts from the University of Lincoln, UK, say that those who experience ‘lucid dreaming’ — a phenomena where someone who is asleep can recognise that they are dreaming — can solve problems in the waking world better than those who remain unaware of the dream until they wake up.It is thought some people are able to do this because of a higher level of insight, meaning their brains detect they are in a dream because events would not make sense otherwise.This cognitive ability translates to the waking world when it comes to finding the solution to a problem by spotting hidden connections or inconsistencies, researchers say.The research by Dr Patrick Bourke, Senior Lecturer at the Lincoln School of Psychology, is the first empirical study demonstrating the relationship between lucid dreaming and insight.The study examined 68 participants aged between 18 and 25 who had experienced different levels of lucid dreaming, from never to several times a month. 

- Each problem consisted of three words and a solution word.Results showed that frequent lucid dreamers solved 25 per cent more of the insight problems than the non-lucid dreamers.The role of dietary coconut for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s diseaseCurtin University (Australia), August 12, 2022According to news reporting originating in Bentley, Australia, research stated, “Coconut oil, derived from the coconut fruit, has been recognised historically as containing high levels of saturated fat; however, closer scrutiny suggests that coconut should be regarded more favourably.”The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Curtin University, “Unlike most other dietary fats that are high in long-chain fatty acids, coconut oil comprises medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA). 

- Ketone bodies are an important alternative energy source in the brain, and may be beneficial to people developing or already with memory impairment, as in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 

- It is rich in dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals; however, notably, evidence is mounting to support the concept that coconut may be beneficial in the treatment of obesity, dyslipidaemia, elevated LDL, insulin resistance and hypertension – these are the risk factors for CVD and type 2 diabetes, and also for AD.

- Those whose plasma vitamin C levels were among the highest 25% had an adjusted risk of dying from cancer or stroke that was 28% lower and a risk of dying from heart disease that was 35% lower than subjects whose levels were lowest.When subjects with low vitamin C levels (defined as 28 micromoles per liter or below) and normal levels (greater than 28 micromoles per liter) were compared, a normal level was associated with a 23% lower risk of premature mortality and a 38% lower risk of dying from heart disease, in comparison with low levels.As a possible reason for their findings, Shao-Ming Wang and colleagues note that oxidative stress is lowered by vitamin C. Oxidative stress can promote endothelial dysfunction that underlies heart disease by increasing inflammation and lipid peroxidation and decreasing nitric oxide availability. 

- Oxidative stress also causes DNA damage associated with cancer.Pomegranate-cocoa blend helps improve aging men’s symptomsShetty Hospital (India), August 19 2022.A study published in the International Journal of Medical Science found benefits for supplementing with a combination of extracts of Punica granatum (pomegranate) fruit rind and Theobroma cocoa seed extracts in middle-aged men.Previous research that investigated the effects of a blend of extracts of pomegranate fruit rind and cocoa seed in young men resulted in increases in serum and free testosterone levels as well as muscle strength and size. 

- All participants were assigned to a program consisting of 30 minutes of walking per day for 5 days per week.At the end of the 7-week period, both doses of pomegranate-cocoa extracts were associated with significant improvement in aging males’ symptom scores, free and total testosterone levels, strength and perceived stress compared to the beginning of the study and to the placebo group.The authors concluded that pomegranate-cocoa “is a well-tolerated, safe, and effective nutraceutical blend that boosts sexual function, testosterone level, and psychological and general well-being in aging males.”Placebo effect demonstrates healing power of the mindHarvard Medical School, August 13, 2022Experts at Harvard Medical School advocate that the placebo effect be received with more positivity, rather than viewed as a deceptive or inaccurate measure designed to test health. 

- The university’s literature says that there is “evidence that some of the placebo effect is a favorable reaction to care and attention from people who patients believe can help ease their suffering and distress.” It goes on to say that the placebo effect “may be an integral part of good medical care and an ally that should be embraced by doctors and patients alike.”This paves the way for potential changes in how health is handled and, furthermore, reinforces the strength of the human mind to bring about healing and desired outcomes, health or otherwise.Awake within a dream: Lucid dreamers show greater insight in waking lifeUniversity of Lincoln (UK), August 12, 2022People who are aware they are asleep when they are dreaming have better than average problem-solving abilities, new research has discovered.Experts from the University of Lincoln, UK, say that those who experience ‘lucid dreaming’ — a phenomena where someone who is asleep can recognise that they are dreaming — can solve problems in the waking world better than those who remain unaware of the dream until they wake up.It is thought some people are able to do this because of a higher level of insight, meaning their brains detect they are in a dream because events would not make sense otherwise.This cognitive ability translates to the waking world when it comes to finding the solution to a problem by spotting hidden connections or inconsistencies, researchers say.The research by Dr Patrick Bourke, Senior Lecturer at the Lincoln School of Psychology, is the first empirical study demonstrating the relationship between lucid dreaming and insight.The study examined 68 participants aged between 18 and 25 who had experienced different levels of lucid dreaming, from never to several times a month. 

- Each problem consisted of three words and a solution word.Results showed that frequent lucid dreamers solved 25 per cent more of the insight problems than the non-lucid dreamers.The role of dietary coconut for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s diseaseCurtin University (Australia), August 12, 2022According to news reporting originating in Bentley, Australia, research stated, “Coconut oil, derived from the coconut fruit, has been recognised historically as containing high levels of saturated fat; however, closer scrutiny suggests that coconut should be regarded more favourably.”The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Curtin University, “Unlike most other dietary fats that are high in long-chain fatty acids, coconut oil comprises medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA). 

- Ketone bodies are an important alternative energy source in the brain, and may be beneficial to people developing or already with memory impairment, as in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 

- It is rich in dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals; however, notably, evidence is mounting to support the concept that coconut may be beneficial in the treatment of obesity, dyslipidaemia, elevated LDL, insulin resistance and hypertension – these are the risk factors for CVD and type 2 diabetes, and also for AD. 

- In addition, phenolic compounds and hormones (cytokinins) found in coconut may assist in preventing the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide, potentially inhibiting a key step in the pathogenesis of AD.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “The purpose of the present review was to explore the literature related to coconut, outlining the known mechanistic physiology, and to discuss the potential role of coconut supplementation as a therapeutic option in the prevention and management of AD.”Cold sores virus, cardiovascular damage linked in studyBrighton and Sussex Medical School, August 14, 2022A herpes virus similar to the one that causes cold sores has been linked to immune cells that can damage cardiovascular tissue, according to a study.Researchers at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School in England found that a relevant number of a specific type of immune cells arise when infection with cytomegalovirus is present.

- These were associated with improvements in muscle strength, gait speed, exercise capacity, waist circumference and blood pressure.The improvements in oxidative stress, glutathione levels and mitochondrial function in the muscle tissue of older humans taking GlyNAC were similar to the improvements in organs such as the heart, liver and kidneys of aged mice supplemented with GlyNAC as reported in the researchers’ recent publication. 

- “Collectively these exciting new discoveries hold great promise for improving our mitochondrial and general health as we age,” Sekhar said.A second vital benefit offered by supplementing GlyNAC is that it also helps protect the body from an important problem called oxidative stress. 

- GlyNAC supplementation corrects glutathione deficiency and lowers oxidative stress in older humans back to youthful levels, thereby solving both problems.“One of the intriguing questions from this trial is why so many improvements occur toward promoting health. 

- Glycine and cysteine are both very important for cellular health on their own, and GlyNAC provides both. 

- Glycine and cysteine are building blocks to form glutathione, which also has health benefits. 

- We believe that the improvements in this trial and in our previous studies are the result of the combined effects of glycine and NAC and glutathione, and we refer to this combination as the ‘Power of 3,'” said Sekhar.GlyNAC supplementation improved muscle strength in the upper and lower extremity and a trend toward increased exercise capacity. 

- “These findings could have additional implications for improving the health of older humans, especially in terms of being able to be more physically active,” said Sekhar.High-fructose corn syrup consumption in adolescence impairs learning and memoryUniversity of Southern California, August 12, 2022Because most corn in America is genetically modified to kill corn “pests,” no human on Earth should be eating it, especially every day. 

- In many ways this region is a canary in the coal mine, as it is particularly sensitive to insult by various environmental factors, including eating foods that are high in saturated fat and processed sugar.”Music More Effective Than Drugs At Releasing Brain’s PainkillersMcGill University (Montreal), August 11, 2022400 published scientific papers have proven the old adage that “music is medicine.” Neurochemical benefits of music can improve the body’s immune system, reduce anxiety levels and help regulate mood in ways that drugs have difficulty competing.“We’ve found compelling evidence that musical interventions can play a health care role in settings ranging from operating rooms to family clinics,” says Prof. Levitin of McGill University’s Psychology Department. 

- They succeeded in isolating four areas where music can help:Reward, motivation, and pleasure (to help with eating disorders, as an example)Stress and arousal (to help reduce anxiety)Immunity (to strengthen the body’s immune system and slow-down age related decline)Social affiliation (to assist in trust building and social bonding)The researchers connected these areas with four primary neuro-chemical systems:Dopamine and opioidsCortisol (and related hormones)Serotonin (and related hormones)Oxytocin“We know music facilitates active neurochemical processes in a symphony of opioids which pharmaceutical intervention has been unable to match,” said Dr. Francis Chandra commenting on the study.Calcium & magnesium reduce risk of metabolic syndrome: 9000-strong studyCase Western Reserve University, August 14, 2022Calcium and magnesium may reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome – but men need above and beyond recommended levels for this effect, say researchers.The researchers from the Case Western Reserve University in the US used 9,148 adults to test the theory that higher dietary intakes of calcium and magnesium decreased the risk of metabolic syndrome.Using 24-hour recalls as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study, they found women who met the US recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for both magnesium (310–320 mg per day) and calcium (1000–1200 mg per day) saw the greatest decrease in risk of metabolic syndrome. 

- However, when these intakes were increased to over 386 mg for magnesium and over 1224 mg per day for calcium, the odds of metabolic syndrome for the men was lowered.“The underlying mechanisms driving the differences we and others have observed by sex are not well understood and warrant additional mechanistic studies,” the researchers wrote.The study measured serum triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and glucose levels as markers of the conditionTreadmill exercise shown to improve Parkinson’s symptoms in miceRush University Medical Center, August 18, 2022Regular treadmill exercise helped improve Parkinson’s disease symptoms in mice in a recent study by researchers at RUSH University Medical Center. 

- The results of the study were recently published in the Cell Reports.“We’re very excited about the results,” said Kalipada Pahan, Ph.D., Floyd A. Davis, MD, Endowed Chair in Neurology and professor of neurological sciences, biochemistry, pharmacology at the RUSH University Medical Center. 

- “Our hope is that we can use this as a jumping off point for furthering our ability to help Parkinson’s patients manage their symptoms.”In the study, scientists found positive results in using regular treadmill exercise to stop the spread of the α-synuclein protein and reverse biochemical, cellular, and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with Parkinson’s disease in the absence of any drugs. 

- The mice in the trial ran on a treadmill consistently in 30-minute intervals for six days a week, over the course of two months.The findings are key in the ongoing research of Parkinson’s, but Pahan and his team were quick to note that while treadmill exercise is something that can be easily available and accessible, some patients with Parkinson’s might not be able to run on a treadmill daily.“Once patients are diagnosed with these neurodegenerative disorders, there are no drugs available for halting the disease progression,” Pahan said. 

- Now in a new study, people who read a book for about 30 minutes a day were found to live approximately 2 years longer than those who didn’t read at all.In previous research, curling up with a good book has been shown to improve people’s social skills by improving their ability to read the thoughts and feelings of others.Researchers at the University of Sussex in England found that reading was “the most effective way to overcome stress” – even better than listening to music, having a cup of tea, or going for a walk.Reading has also been proven to be a great way to keep the mind sharp, and may reduce mental decline by 32%, helping to prevent Alzheimer’s disease.For the new study, researchers from Yale University analyzed data on 3,635 people age 50 and older. 

- This was after accounting for the participants’ age, race, self-reported health, depression, employment, and marital status.Compared with those who didn’t read books, those who read for more than 3.5 hours a week were 23% less likely to die overall.

- (next)Researchers discover how DDT exposure contributes to Alzheimer’s disease riskFlorida International University and Rutgers University, August 17, 2022A new study led by researchers from Florida International University and Rutgers reveals a mechanism linking the pesticide DDT to Alzheimer’s disease. 

- Published in Environmental Health Perspectives, the study shows how the persistent environmental pollutant DDT causes increased amounts of toxic amyloid beta, which form the characteristic amyloid plaques found in the brains of those with Alzheimer’s disease. 

- According to Jason Richardson, professor at FIU’s Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work and corresponding author, the study further demonstrates that DDT is an environmental risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.”The vast majority of research on the disease has been on genetics—and genetics are very important—but the genes that actually cause the disease are very rare,” Richardson says.

- Chan School of Public Health and published in the American Journal of Cardiology. 

- The study revealed that people who used seven grams or more (at least half a tablespoon) of olive oil as a dressing or with bread had a reduced risk of dying from Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, heart disease or respiratory disease compared to those who rarely or never consumed olive oil. 

- Findings also showed that replacing 10 grams a day (about 3/4 tablespoons ) of butter, margarine, mayo or dairy fat with the same amount of olive oil was linked to an impressive eight to 34 percent lower risk of disease-related death. 

- For the study, the researchers analyzed data from 60,582 healthy adult women and 31,801 healthy adult men from the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. 

- (next)Cutting 1 gram from daily salt intake could ward off nearly 9 million cases of stroke/heart diseaseBritish Medical Journal, August 16, 2022A modest cut of just 1 gram in daily salt intake could ward off nearly 9 million cases of heart disease and strokes and save 4 million lives by 2030, suggest the estimates of a modeling study published in the open access journal BMJ Nutrition Prevention & Health. 

- High salt intake drives up blood pressure and therefore the risk of cardiovascular disease, which accounts for 40% of all deaths in China every year. 

- The researchers set out to estimate the health gains that could be achieved by reducing salt intake across the nation, with the aim of helping to inform the development of a doable salt reduction program.Given that, on average, adults in China consume 11 g/day of salt, reducing this by 1 g/day should lower average systolic blood pressure by about 1.2 mmHg. 

- And if this reduction were achieved in a year and sustained, some 9 million cases of heart disease and stroke could be prevented by 2030—4 million of them fatal. 

- Constantly high levels increase one’s risk of various serious diseases including but not limited to Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and various autoimmune conditions.

- NADH is a critical factor in hundreds of metabolic processes, including healthy cell turnover (antiaging), converting food into energy and maintaining the integrity of DNA,[ix] an important factor in disease prevention.NADH has been studied extensively as a therapeutic for CFS, including a study comparing oral NADH with conventional therapy consisting of nutritional supplements and psychological therapy for a period of 24 months. 

- Subjects were randomized to receive either 10 milligrams (mg) of NADH or placebo for a four-week period, followed by a four-week “washout” period, after which subjects were switched to the alternate treatment for a final four-week period.Within this cohort of 26 subjects, eight patients, or 31%, responded favorably to NADH compared to just 8% (two patients) of the placebo group, with no severe adverse reactions related to treatment. 

- The Myelophil extract was given to the treatment cohort in either low- or high-dose groups of 3 or 6 grams of Myelophil daily. 

- A control group was provided with a placebo and all groups were monitored for four weeks.Patients were surveyed for symptom severity and blood antibody arrays were taken to measure inflammatory cytokines, an important marker of disease symptoms.

- The new stark warnings come in a review published in Nutrition Journal, which analysed the impact that the modern Western diet has on immune function and risk of ill-health related to poor immunity and inflammation. 

- "While today's modern diet may provide beneficial protection from micro- and macronutrient deficiencies, our over abundance of calories and the macronutrients that compose our diet may all lead to increased inflammation, reduced control of infection, increased rates of cancer, and increased risk for allergic and auto-inflammatory disease," warned Myles in his review.

- The treatment resulted in a reduced tumor burden and extended the lifespans of the mice by more than 30 percent. 

- The treatment was even more effective when combined with celecoxib, a COX-2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug already approved for treating some forms of arthritis and pain.“Our data suggest that individuals at high risk of developing recurrent intestinal tumors may benefit from chronic TRPV1 activation,” said Raz. 

- “We have provided proof-of-principle.”How Tart Cherries Reduce Inflammation and Oxidative StressNorthumbria University (UK),  August 4, 2022Michigan researchers had previously shown that a cherry-enriched diet not only reduced overall body inflammation, but also reduced inflammation at key sites (belly fat, heart) known to affect heart disease risk in the obese.This study offers further promise that foods rich in antioxidants, such as cherries, could potentially reduce inflammation and have the potential to lower disease risk.”Two daily doses of the tart cherry concentrate was associated with significantly lower levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), compared to placebo, according to findings published in Nutrients. 

- Despite both groups demonstrating a similar drop off in performance and no differences in time trial performance, the results show that both oxidative stress and inflammatory responses were attenuated with Montmorency cherry concentrate supplementation versus placebo.” ”With millions of Americans looking for ways to naturally manage pain, it’s promising that tart cherries can help, without the possible side effects often associated with arthritis medications,” said Kerry Kuehl, M.D, Dr.PH., M.S., Oregon Health & Science University, principal study investigator. 

- “In this case we have cherries, another potent, natural antioxidant proving to be as, if not more effective than pain medications because of the ability for sustained long-term use without side effects in common anti-inflammatory drugs.Tart cherries have also been shown to contain naturally high levels of melatonin, a key compound in the human sleep-and-wake cycle, and new research in the European Journal of Nutrition confirms that melatonin from tart cherries is absorbed by humans. 

- even observed that the Montmorency variety, in particular, contains about six times more melatonin than the Balaton variety.Uncovering the links between diet, gut health and immunityUniversity of Sydney, August 5, 2022A preclinical study from the University of Sydney has found a high-protein diet can change the microbiota of the gut, triggering an immune response. 

- Researchers say the study takes us a step closer to understanding the way diet impacts gut health and immunity.“The focus of our work is on how the gut microbiota—the trillions of bacteria that inhabit the gut—affects the immune system,” said Associate Professor Laurence Macia from the University’s Charles Perkins Center and Faculty of Medicine and Health.Traditionally, however, scientists have focused on the role of dietary fiber in maintaining a healthy gut.In this first-of-its-kind study, published in Nature Communications, the team from the Charles Perkins Center used sophisticated modeling to explore the impact of 10 diets with a different makeup of macronutrients—protein, fats and carbohydrate in mice.Mice fed a high protein diet increased their production of bacterial extracellular vesicles, complex cargo containing bacterial information such as DNA and protein. 

- In essence, we discovered a new way of communication between the gut bacteria and the host which was mediated by protein,” said Associate Professor Macia.While it is too early to say if this research might translate in humans, the researchers say activation of the immune system can prove either good or bad news.“By increasing antibodies in the gut you may see strong protection against potential pathogens, for example salmonella, but on the downside, an activated immune system could mean you are at increased risk of colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease, or autoimmune conditions like Crohn’s,” said lead author and post-doctoral researcher Jian Tan.The results appear consistent with the population impacts of modern-day diets, with the Western world seeing lower rates of gastrointestinal infection but higher rates of chronic disease.Southern-style diet ‘increases death risk’ in kidney disease patientsUniversity of Alabama  1 August 2022New research published in the National Kidney Foundation’s American Journal of Kidney Diseases suggests that eating a “Southern-style diet” is linked with higher death rates in kidney disease patients.Investigating the influence of diet on kidney disease patients, the researchers studied  3,972 participants with stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease who had not started dialysis.

- In fact, some research reports a three-fold higher risk of suicide between midnight and 6:00 am compared to any other time of day.A study in 2020 concluded that nocturnal wakefulness is a suicide risk factor, “possibly through misalignment of circadian rhythms.”Social Isolation, Loneliness Raise Risk Of Death From Heart Attack Or Stroke By Nearly A ThirdUniversity of California, San Diego, August 9, 2022Loneliness increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by almost a third, according to new research. 

- Socially isolated individuals are about 30 percent more likely to suffer a stroke or heart attack — death from either.Scientists at the University of California, San Diego also identified a lack of information on interventions that may boost the health of vulnerable individuals. 

- The findings are based on data pooled from studies across the world over the past 40 years.“Over four decades of research has clearly demonstrated social isolation and loneliness are both associated with adverse health outcomes,” says lead author Dr. 

- Crystal Wiley Cené, a professor of clinical medicine and chief administrative officer for health equity, diversity and inclusion at the school, in a statement. 

- “Given the prevalence of social disconnectedness across the U.S., the public health impact is quite significant.”Risk increases with age due to life factors, such as widowhood and retirement. 

- The study finds social isolation and and loneliness increase the risk of death from heart disease or stroke by 29 and 32 percent, respectively.People with heart disease who were socially isolated had a two to threefold increase in death during a six-year follow-up study. 

- Social isolation during childhood can even lead to cardiovascular disease in adulthood, increasing the risk of obesity, high blood pressure and raised blood glucose levels.Mushrooms of the Far East hold promise for the anti-cancer therapyFar Eastern Federal University (Russia) & University of Lausanne (France), August 3, 2022Mushrooms from the Far East area contain the natural chemical compounds, which could be used for the design of the novel drugs with highly specific anti-tumor activities and low-toxicity.

- Lifting Weights Beats Out Cycling, Swimming For Vegans Wanting Stronger BonesPerfectionism Linked To Burnout At Work, School And Sports, Research Finds Mindfulness Therapy Better Than AntidepressantsAstonishing effects of grapes, remarkable potential for health benefitsWestern New England University, August 8, 2022Recent studies released by Dr. John Pezzuto and his team from Western New England University show “astonishing” effects of grape consumption and “remarkable” impacts on health and on lifespans.Published in the journal Foods, one study showed that adding grapes in an amount equal to just under two cups of grapes per day to a high-fat diet, typically consumed in western countries, yielded reductions in fatty liver and extended lifespans. 

- Acknowledging that it is not an exact science to translate years of lifespan from a mouse to a human, Pezzuto said that his best estimate is the change observed in the study would correspond to an additional 4-5 years in the life of a human.Another study by Dr. Pezzuto and his team published in the journal Antioxidants, reported that grape consumption altered gene expression in the brain and had positive effects on behavior and cognition that were impaired by a high-fat diet.Frequent nut consumption associated with less inflammationBrigham and Women’s Hospital, August 1, 2022In a study of more than 5,000 people, investigators from Brigham and Women’s Hospital have found that greater intake of nuts was associated with lower levels of biomarkers of inflammation, a finding that may help explain the health benefits of nuts. 

- The results of the study appear in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.“Population studies have consistently supported a protective role of nuts against cardiometabolic disorders such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and we know that inflammation is a key process in the development of these diseases,” said corresponding author Ying Bao, MD, ScD, an epidemiologist in BWH’s Channing Division of Network Medicine. 

- “Our new work suggests that nuts may exert their beneficial effects in part by reducing systemic inflammation.”In the current study, the research team performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Nurses’ Health Study, which includes more than 120,000 female registered nurses, and from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, which includes more than 50,000 male health professionals. 

- They measured three well-established biomarkers of inflammation: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2).After adjusting for age, medical history, lifestyle and other variables, they found that participants who had consumed five or more servings of nuts per week had lower levels of CRP and IL6 than those who never or almost never ate nuts. 

- The model enabled the researchers to calculate and compare the emptying rate and the release of a dissolved active pharmaceutical ingredient into the duodenum for a variety of physiological situations.Lifting Weights Beats Out Cycling, Swimming For Vegans Wanting Stronger BonesMedical University of Vienna (Austria), August 2, 2022When it comes to bone health, a new study finds people on a plant-based diet should grab the dumbbells. 

- Researchers in Austria have found that lifting weights is the best form of exercise for vegans – trumping cycling and swimming.The team found that vegans who do resistance training once a week – such as machine-work, free weights, or bodyweight resistance – have stronger bones than plant-based eaters who do other forms of exercise.The new study, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, found vegans who did resistance training had similar bone structure to omnivores — people who eat both meat and vegetables.For at least five years, authors followed 43 men and women on a plant-based diet and 45 men and women who eat meat as well.“Our study showed resistance training offsets diminished bone structure in vegan people when compared to omnivores.”Perfectionism linked to burnout at work, school and sports, research findsYork St. John University (UK), July 31, 2022Concerns about perfectionism can sabotage success at work, school or on the playing field, leading to stress, burnout and potential health problems, according to new research published by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology.In the first meta-analysis of the relationship between perfectionism and burnout, researchers analyzed the findings from 43 previous studies conducted over the past 20 years.

- This induced the development and progression of fatty liver disease to NASH.Importantly, the researchers found that supplementing the diet in the preclinical models with vitamin B12 and folic acid increased the levels of syntaxin 17 in the liver and restored its role in autophagy. 

- It also slowed NASH progression and reversed liver inflammation and fibrosis.Decreased acetyl-L-carnitine levels associated with depressionStanford University, July 30 2022.An article that in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported a link between low levels of acetyl-L-carnitine and a greater risk of depression.Acting on the findings of animal research conducted by lead author Carla Nasca, PhD, the researchers recruited men and women between the ages of 20 and 70 years who had been admitted to Weill Cornell Medicine or Mount Sinai School of Medicine for treatment of acute depression. 

- Acetyl-L-carnitine levels were lowest among depressed patients who had severe symptoms, a history of treatment resistance, or early onset disease. 

- And those who tended towards high levels of neuroticism were likely to benefit the most from in-person interactions.Eating more plant protein associated with lower risk of deathMassachusetts General Hospital & Harvard Medical School, July 31, 2022Eating more protein from plant sources was associated with a lower risk of death and eating more protein from animals was associated with a higher risk of death, especially among adults with at least one unhealthy behavior such as smoking, drinking and being overweight or sedentary, according to an article published online by JAMA Internal Medicine.Mingyang Song, M.D., Sc.D., of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, and coauthors used data from two large U.S. studies that had repeated measures of diet through food questionnaires and up to 32 years of follow-up. 

- Median protein intake, measured as a percentage of calories, was 14 percent for animal protein and 4 percent for plant protein.The authors report:After adjusting for major lifestyle and dietary risk factors, every 10 percent increment of animal protein from total calories was associated with a 2 percent higher risk of death from all causes and an 8 percent increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease death.In contrast, eating more plant protein was associated with a 10 percent lower risk of death from all causes for every 3 percent increment of total calories and a 12 percent lower risk of cardiovascular death.Increased mortality associated with eating more animal protein was more pronounced among study participants who were obese and those who drank alcohol heavily.The association between eating more plant protein and lower mortality was stronger among study participants who smoked, drank at least 14 grams of alcohol a day, were overweight or obese, were physically inactive or were younger than 65 or older than 80.Substituting 3 percent of calories from animal protein with plant protein was associated with a lower risk of death from all causes: 34 percent for replacing processed red meat, 12 percent for replacing unprocessed red meat and 19 percent for replacing eggs.Heat therapy boosts mitochondrial function in musclesBrigham Young University, August 2, 2022A new study finds that long-term heat therapy may increase mitochondrial function in the muscles. 

- The discovery could lead to new treatments for people with chronic illness or disease. 

- The study–the first of its kind in humans–is published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.Mitochondria, the “energy centers” of the cells, are essential for maintaining good health. 

- Exercise has been shown to create new mitochondria and improve function of existing mitochondria. 

- However, some people with chronic illnesses are not able to exercise long enough–previous research suggests close to two hours daily–to reap the benefits. 

- Rodent studies have suggested that heat exposure may also induce the production of more mitochondria.Researchers from Brigham Young University in Utah studied 20 adult volunteers who had not participated in regular exercise in the three months prior to the study. 

- The researchers based the six-day trial of heat on the minimum amount of exercise needed to measure changes in muscle, or about two hours each day. 

- They designed the treatment to mimic the effects of muscle heating that occurs during exercise. 

- The researchers looked at mitochondria content in the muscles on the first day of therapy and 24 hours after the last treatment.Mitochondrial function increased by an average of 28 percent in the heated legs after the heat treatment. 

- )Now, there are growing concerns about the possible negative effects of the chemical on human health and the environment. 

- The chemical has also been found in more than half of freshwater streams in the US.The latest research paper, written by academics from the University of Chicago, focused on the lesser-known effects of triclosan exposure on the bacteria in people’s guts.Disturbing the human microbiome has been “linked to a wide array of diseases and metabolic disorders, including obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and behavioral and metabolic disorders,” wrote the paper’s authors, Alyson L Yee and Jack A Gilbert.To test the chemical’s effect in humans, researchers from Stanford and Cornell universities gave seven volunteers triclosan-containing products, such as toothpaste and liquid soap, to use for four months. 

- The volunteers were compared with a second group who first used the non-triclosan products, then changed to those containing triclosan.The results showed that more triclosan was found in the urine of all the participants during the periods when they were using triclosan-containing products.Yee and Gilbert also suggested that exposure to triclosan could be even more detrimental to the health of developing fetuses and newborns than to adults.

- Relaxation reduces stress and lowers cortisol levels, which is often linked to a multitude of diseases, and so these findings could be particularly significant to public health professionals.The research, carried out in woodland settings across four seasons, also found that smells evoked memories related to childhood activities. 

- Exciting, though, is that these results further suggest that keeping active, and eating and sleeping well during periods of high stress are particularly important to attenuate the accelerated aging of our immune cells," said Puterman.Zinc plus antioxidants: A cost-effective solution to macular degeneration?University of Washington and University College London, July 30, 2022A formula supplement containing anti-oxidants plus zinc appears to be cost-effective in slowing the progression of the ‘wet’ form of the most common degenerative eye disease, finds a new study in British Journal of Ophthalmology.The cost savings and effectiveness of the supplement in advanced (category 4) cases of neovascular (wet-form) Age Related Macular Degeneration (nAMD) are such that their use should be considered in public health policy, recommend the multi-centre study team on behalf of the UK Electronic Medical Record (EMR) AMD Research Team. 

- Category 4 individuals who already had nAMD in one eye, showed a cost saving of nearly €3250 (£3000) per patient over the lifetime of treatment, compared to those not given supplements. 

- The Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) formula supplements also increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.16.“AREDS supplements are a dominant cost-effective intervention for category 4 AREDS patients, as they are both less expensive than standard care and more effective, and therefore should be considered for public funding,” wrote lead researcher Dr. Adnan Tufail.The study examined the use of AREDS formulation 1 and formulation 2 supplements. 

- Consequently, the researchers advocate the use of supplements to reduce the necessity for ranibizumab injections, which is the standard NHS treatment for AMD.Passive exercise offers same brain health benefits as active movements, study findsUniversity of Western Ontario, August 4, 2022A new study by kinesiology graduate students from Western has found passive exercise leads to increased cerebral blood flow and improved executive function, providing the same cognitive benefits as active exercise.Published in Psychophysiology, the study is the first to look at whether there would be benefits to brain health during passive exercise where a person's limbs are moved via an external force—in this case, cycle pedals pushed by a mechanically driven flywheel.During a 20-minute session with healthy young adults, the team found an improvement in executive function of the same magnitude for both the passive and the active exercise conditions, without an increase in heart rate or diastolic blood pressure.Executive function is a higher-order cognitive ability that allows people to make plans and supports the activities of daily living. 

- People who have mild cognitive impairments, such as people experiencing symptoms of early-stage Alzheimer's, can find their executive function negatively affected.Previous research has documented that active exercise, where a person activates their muscles of their own volition, can increase blood flow to the brain and improve executive function. 

- Passive exercise also increases blood flow to the brain, but this is significantly less documented.During passive exercise, a person's limbs move and their muscle receptors are being stretched. 

- This increase in cerebral blood flow, while significantly less than with active exercise, produced executive function improvements of a similar magnitude—an exciting result for the researchers. 

- If done regularly, the increase in blood flow to the brain and resultant improvement in executive function will, optimistically, become a compounding effect that has a significant impact on cognitive health and executive function," Heath explained.

- In the study period, 3,413 participants died, including 1,217 whose deaths were related to cardiovascular disease. 

- In this population, 24 percent of the participants reported running as part of their leisure-time exercise.Compared with non-runners, the runners had a 30 percent lower risk of death from all causes and a 45 percent lower risk of death from heart disease or stroke. 

- Also, to reduce mortality risk at a population level from a public health perspective, the authors concluded that promoting running is as important as preventing smoking, obesity or hypertension. 

- Benefits were also the same regardless of sex, age, body mass index, health conditions, smoking status or alcohol use.The study showed that participants who ran less than 51 minutes, fewer than 6 miles, slower than 6 miles per hour, or only one to two times per week had a lower risk of dying compared to those who did not run.

- This is the first study to show long-term benefits of mother-child reminiscing for emerging adult development.What the Amish can teach us about health and happinessUniversity of Tennessee, July 29, 2022Often viewed as outcasts by mainstream society, the Amish may seem downright bizarre to the average American. 

- The Amish rarely experience disorders like cancer or cardiovascular disease, seemingly able to bypass illness altogether. 

- What's their secret?One of the most striking aspects of the Amish is how they lead their lives, free from modern inventions like electricity, telephones, cars and the myriad of gadgets most of us consider so essential for our productivity and happiness.This high level of daily physical activity helps to keep their obesity rates low and cardiovascular health in top form. 

- Through traditional gender roles, each person has a valued part to play within the community.The study published in Scientific Research discovered that mental health is enhanced by the structure of Amish society. 

- They also tend to be more aggressive and have a higher mortality rate than other breast cancers.“The fact that cardamonin has been used for centuries as a spice and, more recently, as a supplement shows that its intake is safe and may bring health benefits,” said Mendonca. 

- PD-L1 is overexpressed during breast cancer progression and plays a critical role in helping breast cancer cells evade the body’s immune system.They found that cardamonin treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in both cell lines. 

- It also reduced PD-L1 expression in the Caucasian cell line but not the African American cell line, indicating that cells from different races may respond differently to cardamonin because of genetic variations among races.Persistent Low Wages Linked to Faster Memory Decline in Later LifeColumbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, August 2 2022Sustained low wages are associated with significantly faster memory decline, according to a new study by Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. 

- While low-wage jobs have been associated with health outcomes such as depressive symptoms, obesity, and hypertension, which are risk factors for cognitive aging, until now no prior studies had examined the specific relationship between low wages during working years and later-life cognitive functioning. 

- The findings are published in the American Journal of Epidemiology.”Our research provides new evidence that sustained exposure to low wages during peak earning years is associated with accelerated memory decline later in life,” said Katrina Kezios, Ph.D., postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and first author. 

- They experienced approximately one excess year of cognitive aging per a 10-year period; in other words, the level of cognitive aging experienced over a 10-year period by sustained low-wage earners would be what those who never earned low wages experienced in 11 years.”Our findings suggest that social policies that enhance the financial well-being of low-wage workers may be especially beneficial for cognitive health,” said senior author Adina Zeki Al Hazzouri, Ph.D., assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia Mailman School and the Columbia Butler Aging Center. 

- “Future work should rigorously examine the number of dementia cases and excess years of cognitive aging that could be prevented under different hypothetical scenarios that would increase the minimum hourly wage.”Research links red meat intake, gut microbiome, and cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in older adultsTufts University, August 3, 2022Over the years, scientists have investigated the relationship between heart disease and saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, sodium, nitrites, and even high-temperature cooking, but evidence supporting many of these mechanisms has not been robust.

- The research highlighted the spice as a source of potent bioactives, such as cardamonin and alpinetin, which could be used in the treatment or prevention of lung cancer. 

- Fructose in the diet had less severe metabolic effects than soybean oil although it did cause more negative effects in the kidney and a marked increase in prolapsed rectums, a symptom of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which like obesity is on the rise.The mice on the soybean oil-enriched diet gained almost 25 percent more weight than the mice on the coconut oil diet and 9 percent more weight than those on the fructose-enriched diet.

- Nor did brain scans show the shrinkage that accompanies worsening memory problems, she said.By comparison, similar MCI patients in another long-term study of brain health—but without exercise—experienced significant cognitive decline over a year.But the results suggest “this is doable for everybody”—not just seniors healthy enough to work up a hard sweat, said Baker, who presented the data Tuesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference. 

- “Exercise needs to be part of the prevention strategies” for at-risk seniors.Small daily portion of Jarlsberg cheese may help to stave off bone thinningNorwegian Research Council, August 2, 2022A small (57 g) daily portion of Jarlsberg cheese may help to stave off bone thinning (osteopenia/osteoporosis) without boosting harmful low density cholesterol, suggest the results of a small comparative clinical trial, published in the open access journal BMJ Nutrition Prevention & Health.The effects seem to be specific to this type of cheese, the findings indicate.Jarlsberg is a mild and semi-soft, nutty-flavored cheese made from cow’s milk, with regular holes. 

- The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience.“Now there’s an additional reason to eat nutrient-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, eggs and avocados,” said Naiman Khan, a professor of kinesiology and community health at Illinois. 

- “Lutein appears to have some protective role, since the data suggest that those with more lutein were able to engage more cognitive resources to complete the task.”Next, Khan’s group is running intervention trials, aiming to understand how increased dietary consumption of lutein may increase lutein in the eye, and how closely the levels relate to changes in cognitive performance.A stable gut helps elite athletes perform betterAnglia Ruskin University, July 29, 2022New research has found that microbial instability in the gut could hinder the performance of elite endurance athletes, and that short-term, high-protein diets are associated with this type of imbalance.Researchers from across the UK analyzed the performance and gut health of a group of well-matched, highly trained endurance runners, to explore the impact of both high-protein and high-carbohydrate diets.The study found that in those following a high-protein regime, this resulted in a disturbance in the stability of the gut microbiome.

- Another found that compared to beef burgers, plant-based burgers were associated with up to 98% less greenhouse gas emissions.Studies focusing on the healthiness of plant-based products also found they tend to have better nutritional profiles compared to animal products, with one paper finding that 40% of conventional meat products were classified as ‘less healthy’ compared to just 14% of plant-based alternatives based on the UK’s Nutrient Profiling Model.Others found plant-based meat and dairy were good for weight loss and building muscle mass, and could be used to help people with specific health conditions. 

- Food producers may be able to add ingredients such as edible fungi, microalgae or spirulina to plant-based foods, boosting properties such as amino acids, vitamins B and E and antioxidants. 

- Future innovations in processing and ingredients are likely to lead to further nutritional improvements.Pine Bark Extract Treats Meniere’s DiseaseUniversity of Chieti-Pescara (Italy), July 17, 2022Research from Italy’s University of Chieti-Pescara has found that a patented pine bark extract significantly treats Meniere’s disease.Ménière’s disease is a type of vertigo caused by a condition of the inner ear, discovered by the French doctor, Prosper Ménière in the mid-nineteenth century.Dr. 

- Symptoms include periodic headaches, dizziness, nausea and vomiting along with vertigo attacks that can last hours to weeks.The researchers studied 107 patients with Ménière’s disease – each with varying intensity of symptoms.The researchers split the 120 patients into two groups and for six months, and both groups were given conventional treatment.In addition, one group was given 150 milligrams per day of Pycnogenol – a patented pine bark extract from the French Maritime pine tree.They found that after three months of treatment, the pine bark extract group showed significantly better improvement than the control group. 

- Meanwhile, 34 percent of the control group (conventional treatment) recovered after six months.The patients were given 200 milligrams per day of Pycnogenol for 8 weeks and crossed over with a placebo.

- Chan School of Public Health, this new research concluded that “There’s value to focusing on positive psychological factors, like optimism, as possible new ways of promoting longevity and healthy aging across diverse groups.”The research from Harvard noted that women who were the most optimistic were 10% more likely to celebrate their 90th birthday than the least optimistic. 

- Based on total demographics, however, the highest vs. lowest optimism quartile in the Women’s Health Initiative study is broken down as follows:Overall – Associated with 5.4% longer lifespanWhite women – 5.1% longer lifespanBlack women – 7.6% longer lifespanHispanic/Latina women – 5.4% longer lifespanAsian women – 1.5% longer lifespanThis data shows that Black women have the highest longevity rates (at 7.6%) compared to other demographics specifically when optimism is brought into play.Maintaining a positive outlook and optimism are undeniably large parts of the equation when it comes to living a long life, but there are other factors and lifestyle choices that come into play to ensure not only healthy lifespan, but healthy quality of life. 

- These factors include:A healthy diet —It has always been important to maintain a healthy diet to benefit overall health. 

- While the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes fruits and vegetables along with healthy fats and whole grains, is known for its health benefits, the Japanese diet is also a great option, with adherence to this diet being associated with a longer lifespan.Maintaining a healthy weight—Keeping the number on the scale in a healthy range with a combo of diet and exercise is a large aspect of staying healthy.Nutrients—Targeted nutrients can also help support your longevity efforts. 

- Resveratrol has potent anti-aging properties, including fighting free radicals and mimicking calorie restricting diets that are key to longevity.Curcumin: The golden spice is knowing for its anti-inflammatory benefits, and with that, its ability to benefit whole-body health. 

- But, as daycares full of babies conceived with a little “help” can attest, there are options.A new study published in BMC Women’s Health suggests that vitamin E may be helpful for women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction.According to the study, women with polycystic ovary syndrome undergoing ovulation induction who received vitamin E had lower levels of oxidative stress and required lower doses of human menopausal gonadotropin.In addition to potentially supporting fertility, vitamin E has many other health benefits for women with PCOS: it also helps maintain healthy levels of insulin, triglycerides and LDL.In addition to the BMC Women’s Health publication, placebo-controlled studies have shown the benefits of vitamin E for women with PCOS, especially regarding their reproduction and fertility.In the retrospective study from BMC Women’s Health, 321 women with PCOS underwent ovulation induction.105 received 100 mg/d of vitamin E during the follicular phase106 received 100 mg/d of vitamin E during the luteal phase110 did not receive vitamin EThe results? 

- A recent study from the University of East Anglia found some “berry” good news about a way to help support and maintain brain function: cranberry intervention.According to the study, having the equivalent of one cup of fresh cranberries a day can improve memory, neuronal functioning, and vascular health, enhancing blood flow to the brain. 

- And as a sweet bonus, researchers found the red fruit also helps lower LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels, which can build up in the arteries and result in a higher risk for cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s.“Cranberries are rich in these micronutrients [flavonoids, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins] and have been recognized for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,” the authors said.The researchers from the University of East Anglia performed a placebo-controlled study of parallel groups of healthy 50 to 80-year-olds adults to assess the effects of freeze-dried cranberry powder on cognition, brain function and biomarkers for brain cell signaling.The results revealed that taking cranberry extract for 12 weeks improved memory of everyday events (visual episodic memory) and enhanced blood circulation to certain parts of the brain (regional brain perfusion) compared to the placebo group. 

- Strawberries may fend off Alzheimer'sRush University Medical Center, July 28, 2022Could strawberries as a snack or in your cereal, salads or smoothie help protect your brain from Alzheimer's? 

- Tau tangles are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, which is caused by abnormal changes with tau proteins that accumulate in the brain. 

- The study was published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

- Regulated by stretches of DNA called antioxidant response elements, the enzymes prevent oxidative damage and inflammation.”Luesch compares the possibilities of sea lettuce compounds to the proven benefits of sulforaphane in broccoli, an enzyme that works through similar methods to prevent damage from oxidative stress and cancer.Fast food diet before pregnancy can impact breast milk and baby's health, say scientistsUniversity of Cambridge, July 27, 2022A diet high in sugar and fat such as burgers, fries and fizzy drinks can negatively affect a new mother's breast milk and baby's health even before the child is conceived.The new study using lab mice has found that even relatively short-term consumption of a fast food diet impacts women's health, reducing their ability to produce nutritional breast milk after giving birth. 

- This can affect the newborn's well-being, as well as increasing the risk of both mother and child developing potentially fatal conditions such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes in later life.Even mothers who appear to be a healthy weight can be suffering from hidden issues such as a fatty liver—which may be seen in people who are overweight or obese—from eating a diet heavy in processed foods, which tend to be high in fat and sugar. 

- But what was also apparent was that the nutrition to the fetus was changed in pregnancy. 

- Then when we looked at how the mum may be supporting the baby after pregnancy, we found that her mammary gland development and her milk protein composition was altered, and that may have been the explanation for the greater health problems of the newborn pups. 

- Furthermore, researchers claim that these changes are beneficial to our mental and physical health.To elaborate, consider the effect that stress has on the body. 

- This results in a reduced risk of inflammation-related diseases and mental conditions.EGCG in Green Tea inhibits the growth of breast cancer cellsChonbuk National University School of Medicine (S Korea), July 21, 2022According to news reporting originating in Chonbuk, South Korea, research stated, "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major constituent of green tea, has potential as a treatment for a variety of diseases, including cancer. 

- "According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Based on these promising results, EGCG may be a potential treatment for triple negative breast cancer patients. 

- "Curcumin is an exciting compound that has shown promise at detecting and treating the neurodegeneration implicated in numerous eye and brain conditions from glaucoma to Alzheimer's disease, so being able to administer it easily in eye drops may end up helping millions of people," said the study's lead author, Professor Francesca Cordeiro.Curcumin has previously been shown to protect retinal ganglion cells when administered orally. 

- The nanocarrier can be used in eye drops to deliver much higher loads of curcumin than other products in development, increasing the drug's solubility by a factor of almost 400,000, and localises the curcumin in the eyes instead of throughout the body.After twice-daily use of eye drops in the rats for three weeks, retinal ganglion cell loss was significantly reduced compared to matched controls, and the treatment was found to be well-tolerated with no signs of eye irritation or inflammation. 

- By the way, previous research had determined the importance of zinc and its protective effect for the esophagus; however, scientists were never sure exactly why this was so.Researchers out of the UTA College of Nursing and Health Innovation partnered with an experienced esophageal cancer researcher. 

- The flies exposed to blue light showed damage to their retinal cells and brain neurons and had impaired locomotion—the flies’ ability to climb the walls of their enclosures, a common behavior, was diminished.Amla Extract May Boost Endotheial Function, Immune Response and MoreNizam Institute of Medical Sciences (India), July 18, 2022Endothelial dysfunction (ED) has been observed in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and contributes to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. 

- The primary management of MetS involves lifestyle modifications and treatment of its individual components with drugs all of which have side effects. 

- This was due to change in bacterial fermentation and acidity within the gut, which inhibited the bacterial enzyme responsible for histamine production.Bercik said that these results explain the beneficial effects of a low fermentable diet observed in patients with IBS.Eating more ultra-processed foods associated with increased risk of dementiaTianjin Medical University (China), July 27, 2022People who eat the highest amounts of ultra-processed foods like soft drinks, chips and cookies may have a higher risk of developing dementia than those who eat the lowest amounts, according to a new study published in the online issue of Neurology. 

- They include soft drinks, salty and sugary snacks, ice cream, sausage, deep-fried chicken, yogurt, canned baked beans and tomatoes, ketchup, mayonnaise, packaged guacamole and hummus, packaged breads and flavored cereals.For the study, researchers identified 72,083 people from the UK Biobank, a large database containing the health information of half a million people living in the United Kingdom. 

- They then divided participants into four equal groups from lowest percentage consumption of ultra-processed foods to highest.After adjusting for age, gender, family history of dementia and heart disease and other factors that could affect risk of dementia, researchers found that for every 10% increase in daily intake of ultra-processed foods, people had a 25% higher risk of dementia.Researchers also used study data to estimate what would happen if a person substituted 10% of ultra-processed foods with unprocessed or minimally processed foods, like fresh fruit, vegetables, legumes, milk and meat. 

- “It’s encouraging to know that small and manageable changes in diet may make a difference in a person’s risk of dementia.”
Clips :Gravitas Plus: The truth behind preserved and processed foodArticles:Australia: The More “Vaccines” You’ve Had, The Sicker You’ll BeCould certain COVID-19 vaccines leave people more vulnerable to the AIDS virus?NATIONAL PEACE RALLY BLACKLISTED BY MAINSTREAM AND SOCIAL MEDIAHEALTH NEWS:Green tea extract promotes gut health, lowers blood sugarOhio State University, July 26, 2022New research in people with a cluster of heart disease risk factors has shown that consuming green tea extract for four weeks can reduce blood sugar levels and improve gut health by lowering inflammation and decreasing “leaky gut.”Researchers said this is the first study assessing whether the health risks linked to the condition known as metabolic syndrome, which affects about one-third of Americans, may be diminished by green tea’s anti-inflammatory benefits in the gut.”There is much evidence that greater consumption of green tea is associated with good levels of cholesterol, glucose and triglycerides, but no studies have linked its benefits at the gut to those health factors,” said Richard Bruno, senior study author and professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University.In the new study, green tea extract also lowered blood sugar, or glucose, and decreased gut inflammation and permeability in healthy people—an unexpected finding.“What this tells us is that within one month we’re able to lower blood glucose in both people with metabolic syndrome and healthy people, and the lowering of bloodglucose appears to be related to decreasing leaky gut and decreasing gut inflammation—regardless of health status,” Bruno said.”We did not attempt to cure metabolic syndrome with a one-month study,” he said. 

- These findings suggest that aging may trigger an adaptive response to counteract the effects of oxidative stress on blood vessels.”Molecules known as reactive oxygen species, or ROS, play an important role in regulating cellular function,” said Steven Segal, a professor of medical pharmacology and physiology at the MU School of Medicine and senior author of the study. 

- However, how effective flavanols are in everyday life in reducing blood pressure has remained unknown, as previous studies in this area have been performed in tightly controlled experimental settings.Surrey’s new research reduces concerns that cocoa as a treatment for raised blood pressure could pose health risks by decreasing blood pressure when it is not raised, paving the way for it to be potentially used in clinical practice.In the first study of its kind study, researchers set out to investigate the use of flavanols, a compound found in cocoa, in lowering blood pressure and arterial stiffness in individuals outside of clinical settings.For several days, eleven healthy participants consumed, on alternating days, either six cocoa flavanol capsules or six placebo capsules containing brown sugar. 

- Doctors often fear that some blood pressure tablets can decrease the blood pressure too much on some days.Greater potassium intake linked to lower blood pressure in womenAmsterdam University Medical Center, July 25 2022.A study  in European Heart Journal found an association between consuming a higher amount of potassium and lower blood pressure among women with a high intake of sodium. 

- “It is well known that high salt consumption is associated with elevated blood pressure and a raised risk of heart attacks and strokes,” noted study author Liffert Vogt, MD, PhD, of Amsterdam University Medical Center. 

- “Health advice has focused on limiting salt intake but this is difficult to achieve when our diets include processed foods. 

- In this group, each 1 gram increase in potassium consumption was associated with a 2.4 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure.During a median follow-up of 19.5 years, 54.5% of the men and women experienced cardiovascular disease events. 

- Men whose potassium intake was among the top one-third of participants had a 7% lower risk of hospitalization or death caused by cardiovascular disease compared to men whose intake was among the lowest third. 

- Among women whose potassium intake was highest, the risk was 11% lower.Elderberry benefits air travelersGriffith University, July 21, 2022The negative health effects of international air travel are well documented but now it seems that the common elderberry can provide some relief.Associate Professor Evelin Tiralongo and Dr Shirley Wee from Griffith’s Menzies Health Institute Queensland (MHIQ) have completed a clinical trial showing that an elderberry supplement can provide some protection from cold and flu-like symptoms following long-haul flights.Intercontinental air travel can be stressful and affect a passenger’s physical and psychological wellbeing. 

- The effect was most obvious in the upper part of the gut," explained Professor John Mathers, professor of Human Nutrition at Newcastle University. 

- This type of starch has several health benefits and fewer calories than regular starch. 

- "New study finds lowest risk of death was among adults who exercised 150-600 minutes/weekHarvard School of Public Health, July 25, 2022An analysis of more than 100,000 participants over a 30-year follow-up period found that adults who perform two to four times the currently recommended amount of moderate or vigorous physical activity per week have a significantly reduced risk of mortality, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation. 

- The reduction was 21-23% for people who engaged in two to four times the recommended amount of vigorous physical activity, and 26-31% for people who engaged in two to four times the recommended amount of moderate physical activity each week.In 2018, the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommended that adults engage in at least 150-300 minutes/week of moderate physical activity or 75-150 minutes/week of vigorous physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both intensities.The analysis also found:Participants who met the guidelines for vigorous physical activity had an observed 31% lower risk of CVD mortality and 15% lower risk of non-CVD mortality, for an overall 19% lower risk of death from all causes.Participants who met the guidelines for moderate physical activity had an observed 22-25% lower risk of CVD mortality and 19-20% lower risk of non-CVD mortality, for an overall 20-21% lower risk of death from all causes.Participants who performed two to four times above the recommended amount of long-term vigorous physical activity (150-300 min/week) had an observed 27-33% lower risk of CVD mortality and 19% non-CVD mortality, for an overall 21-23% lower risk of death from all causes.Participants who performed two to four times above the recommended amount of moderate physical activity (300-600 min/week) had an observed 28-38% lower risk of CVD mortality and 25-27% non-CVD mortality, for an overall 26-31% lower risk of mortality from all causes.In addition, no harmful cardiovascular health effects were found among the adults who reported engaging in more than four times the recommended minimum activity levels. 

- Previous studies have found evidence that long-term, high-intensity, endurance exercise, such as marathons, triathlons and long-distance bicycle races, may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial fibrosis, coronary artery calcification, atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.Treating dementia with the healing waves of soundUltrasound applied to the brain could help treat patients with dementia.Tohoku University (Japan), July 20, 2022Ultrasound waves applied to the whole brain improve cognitive dysfunction in mice with conditions simulating vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. 

- "The LIPUS therapy is a non-invasive physiotherapy that could apply to high-risk elderly patients without the need for surgery or anaesthesia, and could be used repeatedly," says Shimokawa.The Tohoku University team found that cognitive impairment markedly improved in mice with conditions similar to vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease when LIPUS was applied to the whole brain three times a day for 20 minutes each time.Study: ADHD drugs do not improve cognition in healthy college studentsUniversity of Rhode Island, July 19, 2022Contrary to popular belief across college campuses, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications may fail to improve cognition in healthy students and actually can impair functioning, according to a study by researchers at the University of Rhode Island and Brown University.Study co-investigators Lisa Weyandt, professor of psychology and a faculty member with URI's George and Anne Ryan Institute for Neuroscience, and Tara White, assistant professor of research in behavioral and social sciences at Brown University, had anticipated different findings. 

- Likewise, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center states that guanabana shows anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo.Revered for centuries in South America and Southeast Asia, the bark, leaves, root, seeds and fruit have been used to tame heart disease, asthma, liver issues and arthritis. 

- *A word of caution: Excessive consumption of guanabana can lead to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. 

- Consult with a qualified practitioner before taking guanabana on a daily basis.High-strength cannabis linked to addiction and mental health problemsUniversity of Bath (UK), July 25, 2022As the strength or potency of cannabis products has increased internationally over the years, so have rates of people being treated for cannabis addiction, say the authors of a new study.Researchers from the Addiction and Mental Health Group at the University of Bath (UK) have systematically analyzed the relationship between the types of cannabis people use and their addiction and mental health problems. 

- It also suggests that people using high-potency cannabis are more likely to experience a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia.These findings may help to explain why more people have received treatment for cannabis problems over recent years. 

- Data from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction show a 76% increase in people entering treatment for cannabis addiction in the past decade. 

- In fact, the country is one of the top 10 producers of this legume in the world, and several studies have reflected the correlation between consumption and decreased chronic degenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes.Therefore, the National School of Biological Sciences of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN-ENCB), conducted an investigation to evaluate the antioxidant and antihypertensive activity in black beans, and found that in addition to these qualities, proteins in the bean can remove heavy metals from the body.The polytechnic research identified bioactive peptides in the legume that have a beneficial effect as antihypertensive and antioxidant, which could favor the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, with a specific effect on blood pressure and oxidative stress.It was determined that fasolina and lectin hydrolysates (main proteins in the Jamapa black bean) had chelating activity (removal of heavy metals in the body) and, when hydrolyzed with pepsin-pancratin, they release peptides (amino acids) with antihypertensive and antioxidant effects.Could Eating Fruit More Often Keep Depression At Bay?Aston University (UK), July 15, 2022People who frequently eat fruit are more likely to report greater positive mental well-being and are less likely to report symptoms of depression than those who do not, according to new research from the College of Health and Life Sciences, Aston UniversityThe study found frequent fruit eaters had greater positive mental wellbeingThe study surveyed 428 adults and looked at the relationship between their consumption of fruit, vegetables, sweet and savoury food snacks and their psychological healthThe more often people ate fruit, the lower they scored for depression and the higher for mental well-being.Published in the British Journal of Nutrition, the study surveyed 428 adults from across the UK and looked at the relationship between their consumption of fruit, vegetables, sweet and savoury food snacks, and their psychological health.People who frequently snacked on nutrient-poor savoury foods (such as crisps) were more likely to experience 'everyday mental lapses' (known as subjective cognitive failures) and report lower mental wellbeing. 

- "Research from Pondicherry University, "In the present study, we for the first time investigated the effect of quercetin, caloric restriction and combined treatment (caloric restriction with quercetin) on oxidative stress parameters, acetylcholinesterase and ATPases enzyme activities in the cerebral cortex of aged male Wistar rats.Our results demonstrate that combined treatment of caloric restriction and quercetin significantly improved the age associated decline in the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes [such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)] and glutathione (GSH), and nitric oxide (NO).According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Finally, we conclude that combined treatment of caloric restriction and quercetin in late life is an effective anti-aging therapy to counteract the age related accumulation of oxidative macromolecular damage. 

- "How Drinking Soda on a Hot Day Can Damage Kidneys, Leading to Diabetes, Heart DiseaseUniversity of Buffalo, July 18, 2022Research demonstrates the acute deleterious effects soda can have on your kidney function when used to quench your thirst during exertion on a hot day.Drinking soda causes dehydration and raises markers for kidney disease when consumed after performing manual labor or exercise in 95-degree Fahrenheit weather.When you exert yourself in a hot environment, your body regulates blood pressure and conserves water by reducing blood flow to your kidneys. 

- A sudden and steep drop in blood flow through your kidneys can cause acute kidney injury due to the fact that it reduces the amount of oxygen being delivered to your kidneys.Your diet has an overriding influence over the health of your kidneys, with sugar and excess protein topping the list of food components known to cause problems when consumed regularly.The study, published in the American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, found soda caused dehydration and raised markers for kidney disease when consumed after performing manual labor in 95-degree F. weather.“The volunteers completed … a 30-minute treadmill workout followed by three different five-minute lifting, dexterity and sledgehammer swinging activities. 

- After 45 minutes of exercise, the volunteers rested for 15 minutes … while drinking 16 ounces of either a high-fructose, caffeinated soft drink or water. 

- The results showed that after just 24 hours of treatment there was a significant concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect on these cells. 

- Their findings are quite remarkable as they were able to demonstrate that thymoquinone was a potent inhibitor of oral cancer cell viability via two distinct anti-neoplastic mechanisms.No bones about it: Cannabis may be used to treat fracturesTel Aviv University researcher finds non-psychotropic compound in marijuana can help heal bone fissuresTel Aviv University (Israel), July 19, 2022A study published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research by Tel Aviv University and Hebrew University researchers explores another promising new medical application for marijuana.

- It is reportedly the second most common disease worldwide, with 30–50% of the US population suffering from it.Data published in the Journal of Dental Research indicated that DHA supplementation was associated with a decreased the average depth of the pockets between the teeth and the gums, and the gingival index, which is used to assess the extent of gum disease.In addition, inflammatory biomarkers in the gum tissue were significantly reduced.Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 2,000 mg per day of DHA or placebo (soy/corn oil) for three months. 

- In addition to the improvements in pocket depth and gingival index, the researchers reported that levels of the inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) decreased significantly in the DHA group.This “Holy Herb’ Shows Promise in Treating Alzheimer’s DiseaseYerba santa may also treat brain swelling in dementia patientsSalk Institute, July 14, 2022A shrub known as Yerba santa, dubbed “holy herb” in Spanish, appears to show promise in treating Alzheimer’s disease, researchers say. 

- It has the potential to reduce brain swelling in people with dementia.Native to California, Yerba santa has long been used as a treatment for fevers, headaches, and other common ailments. 

- But researchers at Salk’s Cellular Neurobiology Laboratory believe it could be used to treat much more serious health problems. 

- In fact, millions of dementia patients stand to benefit from the natural treatment, they claim.A molecule in the shrub called sterubin – the plant’s most active component – could be the key to transforming millions of lives. 

- The team found that sterubin had a significant anti-inflammatory effect on brain cells called microglia, which are involved in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, among other ailments.The researchers further found that sterubin effectively removes iron. 

- Join a gymMen's hot flashes: Hypnotic relaxation may ease the discomfort men don't talk aboutCinnamon could stop Parkinson’s in its tracksRush University Medical Center, July 14, 2022In an article appearing in the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology indicates that cinnamon could one day be used by Parkinson’s disease patients to prevent the disease from progressing.Saurabh Khasnavis and Kalipada Pahan, PhD, of Rush University Medical Center studied the effects of the spice in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease. 

- Motor function, which can be significantly impaired by the disease, was improved in animals that received cinnamon. 

- "Cinnamon is metabolized in the liver to sodium benzoate, which is an FDA-approved drug used in the treatment for hepatic metabolic defects associated with hyperammonemia," explained lead researcher Dr Pahan"Cinnamon has been used widely as a spice throughout the world for centuries,” he noted. 

- “This could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in Parkinson's patients. 

- Results from a meta-analysis of randomized trials reported in the Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics concluded that protein supplements rich in the essential branched-chain amino acid leucine could improve muscle strength in sarcopenic individuals.“The treatment of choice for sarcopenia is still resistance exercise with nutritional supplementation because no pharmacological agents to treat sarcopenia have become available yet,” Sang Yoon Lee, MD, PhD, and colleagues at Seoul National University College of Medicine noted.The meta-analysis included 6 randomized, controlled trials that involved a total of 699 men and women with sarcopenia. 

- Muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance were evaluated before and after the treatment periods.Muscle strength significantly improved in leucine-supplemented participants as a primary outcome in comparison with the control groups. 

- Lipoic acid, melatonin, thymoquinone, astaxanthin and sulforaphane can promote Nrf2 activity.Activation of these mechanisms also promotes autophagy, a process in which the cells consume their own damaged cellular components, which helps to prevent apoptosis (programmed cell death) and senescence in osteoblasts and osteocytes.“Regimens providing a selection of these nutraceuticals in clinically meaningful doses may have an important potential for preserving bone health,” the authors concluded. 

- “Concurrent supplementation with taurine, N-acetylcysteine, vitamins D and K2, and minerals, including magnesium, zinc, and manganese, plus a diet naturally high in potassium, may also be helpful in this regard.”Searching for meaning?

- Phthalates are chemicals used in personal care products, such as cosmetics, as well as in solvents, detergents, and food packaging.After analyzing data from more than 6,000 pregnant women in the United States, researchers found that women with higher concentrations of several phthalate metabolites in their urine were more likely to deliver their babies preterm, which is delivering three or more weeks before a mother’s due date.“Having a preterm birth can be dangerous for both baby and mom, so it is important to identify risk factors that could prevent it,” said Kelly Ferguson, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, and the senior author on the study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.Higher concentrations of most phthalate metabolites examined were associated with slightly higher odds of preterm birth. 

- "It is known that vitamin A deficiencies lead to increased susceptibility to disease and low concentrations of immune cells in the mucosal barrier that lines the intestines," said Chang Kim, the professor and section head of microbiology and immunology in Purdue's College of Veterinary Medicine who led the research. 

- Quercetin phytosome reduced allergy symptoms in clinical trialUniversity of Shizuoka (Japan), July 11 2022.A randomized trial described in the European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences revealed a decrease in seasonal allergy symptoms among men and women who were given quercetin, a flavonoid that occurs in fruits, tea, onions and herbs.The trial included 60 participants who reported experiencing eye and nasal symptoms related to pollen or house dust exposure. 

- Blood samples were analyzed for various factors and quality of life questionnaires that evaluated eye and nasal symptoms were administered before the treatment period and at 2 and 4 weeks.At the end of the study, eye itching, sneezing, nasal discharge and sleep disorder scores, were significantly improved among participants who received quercetin in comparison with participants who received a placebo. 

- Severity of sneezing, nasal discharge and disturbance of daily living were lower at the end of various time points among supplemented participants compared to the placebo group.Kiwi fruit powder shows gut health benefitsMedicus Research (New Zealand), July 10, 2022Kiwifruit containing Zyactinase called Kivia may enhance bowel movement frequency and improve other symptoms of occasional constipation, say new data from a randomized clinical trial.A daily 5.5 gram dose of Kivia powder was associated with a reduction in abdominal pain and flatulence in subjects with occasional constipation, according to findings published in the Nutrition Journal .While the exact mechanism of action is still to be elucidated, researchers led by Dr Jay Udani at Medicus Research note that kiwifruit extract is rich in enzymes able to aid in digestion, as well as potential prebiotics which may enhance the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut.“Improvements were noted in the number of bowel movements, with increased bowel movements in the group using the studied extract,” they wrote. 

- “There were also improvements observed in bowel health and stool formation.“This suggests that Kivia powder improved bowel habits in this group of subjects.”Results showed that the Kivia group experienced significant increases in spontaneous bowel movements at every week, compared to data from the start of the study. 

- Significant differences were also observed between the kiwifruit extract group and placebo at weeks 3 and 4.Lifestyle may be more important than age in determining dementia risk: StudyBaycrest Centre for Geriatric Care, July 13, 2022Individuals with no dementia risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes or hearing loss, have similar brain health as people who are 10 to 20 years younger than them, according to a new Baycrest study. 

- This is great news, since there's a lot you can do to modify these factors, such as managing diabetes, addressing hearing loss, and getting the support you need to quit smoking," says Dr. Annalise LaPlume, Postdoctoral Fellow at Baycrest's Rotman Research Institute (RRI) and the study's lead author.The study is one of the first to look at lifestyle risk factors for dementia across the entire lifespan.The study, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment, and Disease Monitoring, a journal of the Alzheimer's Association, included data from 22,117 people aged 18 to 89.The researchers looked at participants' performance on memory and attention tests, and how this was impacted by eight modifiable risk factors for dementia: low education (less than a high school diploma), hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, alcohol or substance abuse, hypertension, smoking (currently or in the past four years), diabetes and depression.Each factor led to a decrease in cognitive performance by as much as three years of aging, with each additional factor contributing the same amount of decline. 

- In Japan, historical medicinal uses for Matcha included helping people relax, preventing obesity, and treatment of skin conditions. 

- Using this test, researchers found that mouse anxiety was reduced after consuming Matcha powder or Matcha extract.Spirituality linked with better health outcomes, patient careHarvard School of Public Health, July 13 2022Spirituality should be incorporated into care for both serious illness and overall health, according to a study led by researchers at Harvard T.H. 

- Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women's Hospital. 

- "This study represents the most rigorous and comprehensive systematic analysis of the modern day literature regarding health and spirituality to date," said Tracy Balboni, lead author and senior physician at Harvard Medical School. 

- "Our findings indicate that attention to spirituality in serious illness and in health should be a vital part of future whole person-centered care, and the results should stimulate more national discussion and progress on how spirituality can be incorporated into this type of value-sensitive care. 

- "According to the International Consensus Conference on Spiritual Care in Health Care, spirituality is "the way individuals seek ultimate meaning, purpose, connection, value, or transcendence." 

- The information gleaned from the conversation can guide further medical decision-making, including but not limited to notifying a spiritual care specialist. 

- "Overlooking spirituality leaves patients feeling disconnected from the health care system and the clinicians trying to care for them," said Koh. 

- "Integrating spirituality into care can help each person have a better chance of reaching complete well-being and their highest attainable standard of health. 

- They also found that kids didn’t have to get out and exercise to feel more positive than those on screens, as doing their homework or reading also contributed to better well-being.The team analyzed data from 61,759 school students in fourth through ninth grade to see what they did between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. each day. 

- Lead researcher Dr. Rosa Virgara says the research highlights an acute need to encourage children to participate in activities and cut down on screen time.“Our study highlights how some out-of-school activities can boost children’s well-being, while others – particularly screens – can chip away at their mental and physical health,” Virgara says in a university release. 

- Physicians and medical professionals who disagree with the pandemic's lockdowns, drug treatments, vaccine mandates and the wet market theory about the SARS-2 virus' origins, are censored, demonized and threatened with the loss of their medical licenses. 

- Despite the widespread use of psychiatric drugs to palliate symptoms and enormous resources spent to tackle the epidemic of mental disorders, Americans’ psychological health continues to worsen. 

- "These are exciting discoveries that we may be able to use to personalize treatment for patients," Dr. Taneja says. 

- Dr. Taneja treated one group of arthritis-susceptible mice with a bacterium, Prevotella histicola, and compared that to a group that had no treatment. 

- The treatment produced fewer side effects, such as weight gain and villous atrophy—a condition that prevents the gut from absorbing nutrients—that may be linked with other, more traditional treatments.While human trials have not yet taken place, the mice's immune systems and arthritis mimic humans, and shows promise for similar, positive effects. 

- Since this bacterium is a part of healthy human gut, treatment is less likely to have side effects, says study co-author Joseph Murray, M.D., a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist.Adding salt to your food at the table is linked to higher risk of premature deathTulane University School of Public Health, July 11, 2022People who add extra salt to their food at the table are at higher risk of dying prematurely from any cause, according to a study of more than 500,000 people, published in the European Heart Journal today.Compared to those who never or rarely added salt, those who always added salt to their food had a 28% increased risk of dying prematurely. 

- "It provides novel evidence to support recommendations to modify eating behaviors for improving health. 

- Even a modest reduction in sodium intake, by adding less or no salt to food at the table, is likely to result in substantial health benefits, especially when it is achieved in the general population. 

- "We need to further explore this possibility, but our results suggest that 6-PN could have anti-cancer effects," Bolton said.New study determines psychedelic mushroom microdoses can improve mood, mental healthUniversity of British Columbia, July 11, 2022The latest study to examine how tiny amounts of psychedelics can impact mental health provides further evidence of the therapeutic potential of microdosing.Published in Scientific Reports, the study followed 953 people taking regular small amounts of psilocybin and a second group of 180 people who were not microdosing.For the 30-day study, those microdosing demonstrated greater improvements in mood, mental health and psychomotor ability over the one-month period, compared to non-microdosing peers who completed the same assessments.

- Researchers now believe that Alzheimer’s disease begins with changes in the brain as much as 30 years or more before symptoms begin.This shocking revelation comes at a time when the aging of the Baby Boomer generation means Alzheimer’s is expected to triple in the coming decades. 

- With conventional medicine unable to offer a cure, this realization makes it all the more critical to care for brain health throughout your lifetime, naturally reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. 

- Instead, loss of memory is a sign of the brain beginning to break down.In addition to a diagnosis for ADD, other factors he believes can increase the risk of developing the disease include:• Failure to engage the brain in regular learning activities• Lack of exercise or exercising less than twice a week• Personal medical history of cancer, diabetes or heart disease• Suffering of a stroke• Coping with a head injury• Diagnosis of depressionAlong with understanding your risk level, Dr. Amen advocates keeping both mind and body active. 

- Bye Bye BorisCurcumin reduces muscle soreness: StudyUniversity of Naples, July 3, 2022A proprietary curcumin extract can ease post-exercise muscle soreness caused by oxidative stress and inflammation, an Italian study has found.The randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind pilot trial gave 20 moderately active men 1 g of curcumin twice a day which contained 200 mg of the antioxidant or placebo.Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) was reduced in the curcumin group after all the men had taken part in a strenuous downhill running exercise.The curcumin group reported less pain in the lower limb as compared with subjects in the placebo group, “although significant differences were observed only for the right and left anterior thighs.”Vitamin C related to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and early deathUniversity of Copenhagen (Denmark), July 7, 2022New research from the University of Copenhagen and Herlev and Gentofte Hospital shows that high vitamin C concentrations in the blood from the intake of fruit and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and early death.New research from the University of Copenhagen shows that the risk of cardiovascular disease and early death falls with a high intake of fruit and vegetables, and that this may be dued to vitamin C.As part of the study, the researchers had access to data about 100,000 Danes and their intake of fruit and vegetables as well as their DNA. 

- "We can see that those with the highest intake of fruit and vegetables have a 15% lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and a 20% lower risk of early death compared with those who very rarely eat fruit and vegetables. 

- Members of the mindfulness group completed four separate 20-minute mindfulness training sessions.Researchers found that participants who were actively meditating reported a 32 percent reduction in pain intensity and a 33 percent reduction in pain unpleasantness.When the team analyzed participants' brain activity during the task, they found that mindfulness-induced pain relief was associated with reduced synchronization between the thalamus (a brain area that relays incoming sensory information to the rest of the brain) and parts of the default mode network (a collection of brain areasmost active while a person is mind-wandering or processing their own thoughts and feelings as opposed to the outside world).One of these default mode regions is the precuneus, a brain area involved in fundamental features of self-awareness, and one of the first regions to go offline when a person loses consciousness.Four in 10 pancreatic cancers could be prevented by lifestyle changesCancer Research UK, July 2, 2022Almost 40 per cent of pancreatic cancers -- one of the deadliest forms of cancer -- could be avoided in the UK through maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking according to Cancer Research UK, in a call to arms against the disease.While more research is needed to find better ways of diagnosing and treating the disease, there is evidence to suggest that some pancreatic cancers are linked to being overweight and to smoking -- and almost four in 10 could be prevented by lifestyle changes to address this.Doing something is better than doing nothing for most people, study showsUniversity of Virginia and Harvard University, July 3, 2022Most people are just not comfortable in their own heads, according to a new psychological investigation led by the University of Virginia. 

- Wilson and his team note that men tend to seek "sensations" more than women, which may explain why 67 percent of men self-administered shocks to the 25 percent of women who did.Post-pandemic diet shifts could avert millions of deathsUniversity of Edinburgh, July 8, 2022Encouraging people to eat more fruit and vegetables post-pandemic could avert up to 26 million deaths every year by 2060, a study has found.Premature deaths from diseases such as heart disease, stroke and cancer—conditions that are also risk factors for COVID-19 patients—could be prevented by including measures to reduce global meat consumption in recovery plans, researchers say.Reducing the amount of meat eaten globally would also make food more affordable—particularly in low- and middle-income countries—and be better for environment, the analysis shows.The findings suggest post-pandemic plans prioritizing economic recovery above all else would lead to millions more deaths linked to poor diet, be worse for the environment and do less to reduce food costs.A team led by Edinburgh researchers show plans that include dietary shifts toward less meat and more fruit and vegetables could prevent 2600 premature deaths per million people by 2060. 

- An Imminent Threat from Artificial Intelligence | Aidan Gomez | TEDxOxfordStudy finds people who practice intermittent fasting experience less severe complications from COVID-19Intermountain Healthcare, July 7, 2022Intermittent fasting has previously shown to have a host of health benefits, including lowering the risk of diabetes and heart disease. 

- Now, researchers from Intermountain Healthcare have found that people who regularly fast are less like to experience severe complications from COVID-19.In a new study published this week in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health, Intermountain researchers found that COVID-19 patients who practiced regular water-only intermittent fasting had lower risk of hospitalization or dying due to the virus than patients who did not.“Intermittent fasting has already shown to lower inflammation and improve cardiovascular health.

- New research suggests that many people may indeed reap mental health benefits from working with plants — even if they’ve never gardened before.In a study published in the journal “PLOS ONE,” University of Florida scientists found that gardening activities lowered stress, anxiety and depression in healthy women who attended twice-weekly gardening classes. 

- All were in good health, which for this experiment meant screening for factors such as chronic health conditions, tobacco use and drug abuse, and having been prescribed medications for anxiety or depression. 

- The art group served as a point of comparison with the gardening group.“Both gardening and art activities involve learning, planning, creativity and physical movement, and they are both used therapeutically in medical settings. 

- This makes them more comparable, scientifically speaking, than, for example, gardening and bowling or gardening and reading,” Guy explained.Given the relatively small number of participants and the length of the study, the researchers were still able to demonstrate evidence of what medical clinicians would call the dosage effects of gardening — that is, how much gardening someone has to do to see improvements in mental health.Vitamin B3 reduces the risk of skin cancerUniversity of Sydney, July 5, 2022Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine offers new hope to those at high risk of developing the most common types of skin cancer. 

- The “healthy” fats in avocados also had no negative effect on a person’s belly fat or waist circumference, though it didn’t lead to any weight loss either.Previous studies have pointed to the benefits of eating avocados for losing weight, but the current study  is the largest to date that looks at multiple health effects of avocados.“While the avocados did not affect belly fat or weight gain, the study still provides evidence that avocados can be a beneficial addition to a well-balanced diet,” says Penny Kris-Etherton, an Evan Pugh University Professor of Nutritional Sciences at Penn State, in a university release. 

- “Incorporating an avocado per day in this study did not cause weight gain and also caused a slight decrease in LDL cholesterol, which are all important findings for better health.”Doing good deeds helps socially anxious people relaxSimon Fraser University (Canada) July 1, 2022Being busy with acts of kindness can help people who suffer from social anxiety to mingle more easily. 

- BOMBSHELL: Dr. Clare Craig Exposes How Pfizer Twisted Their Clinical Trial Data for Young ChildrenGreater folate and vitamin B6 intake linked to lower risk of mortality during 9.8-year periodZhengzhou University (China), July 6 2022.A study published in Nutrients revealed a decreased risk of death during a median period of 9.8 years among men and women with a greater intake of vitamin B6 and the B vitamin folate compared to those whose intake was lower.The investigation included 55,569 participants enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and eight cycles of the continuous NHANES that occurred between 1999 and 2014. 

- Dietary recall interview responses were analyzed for the intake of folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12.Men whose intake of folate was among the top 25% of individuals in the study had a 23% lower risk of death from any cause, a 41% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and a 32% lower risk of cancer mortality during follow-up than those whose intake was among the lowest 25%. 

- Among women in the top 25%, the risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were 14% and 47% lower.For men whose intake of vitamin B6 was among the highest 25% of those included in the study, the risk of all-cause mortality was 21% lower, cardiovascular disease mortality was 31% lower and cancer mortality was 27% lower compared to individuals whose intake was lowest. 

- The risk of mortality among women whose vitamin B6 intake was among the top 25% was 12% lower than those whose intake was among the lowest 25% and their risk of dying from cardiovascular disease was 44% lower.To shed weight, go veganE-Da Hospital  (Taiwan), June 30, 2022People on a vegetarian diet, and especially those following a vegan one that includes no animal products, see better results than dieters on other weight-reducing plans. 

- The current research suggests that resveratrol could help protect against the adverse effects of weightlessness during space flight as well as those caused by a sedentary lifestyle, which has been linked to cardiovascular disease, obesity and other health conditions.“Long-term spaceflight induces hypokinesia and hypodynamia, which, along microgravity per se, result in a number of significant physiological alterations, such as muscle atrophy, force reduction, insulin resistance, substrate use shift from fats to carbohydrates, and bone loss. 

- “Each of these adaptations could turn to serious health deterioration during the long-term spaceflight needed for planetary exploration.”The research team tested the effects of resveratrol in rats undergoing simulated weightlessness. 

- While animals that did not receive resveratrol experienced a reduction in soleus muscle mass and strength, bone mineral density and resistance to breakage, as well as the development of insulin resistance, treatment with resveratrol protected against these conditions.“There are overwhelming data showing that the human body needs physical activity, but for some of us, getting that activity isn’t easy,” commented FASEB Journal Editor-in-Chief Gerald Weissmann, MD. 

- For the earthbound, barriers to physical activity are equally challenging, whether they be disease, injury, or a desk job. 

- Resveratrol may not be a substitute for exercise, but it could slow deterioration until someone can get moving again.”Why does acupuncture work? 

- The risk of developing dementia was even higher for people whose thyroid condition required thyroid hormone replacement medication.“In some cases, thyroid disorders have been associated with dementia symptoms that can be reversible with treatment,” said study author Chien-Hsiang Weng, MD, MPH, of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.For the study, researchers looked at the health records of 7,843 people newly diagnosed with dementia in Taiwan and compared them to the same number of people who did not have dementia. 

- “One explanation for this could be that these people are more likely to experience greater symptoms from hypothyroidism where treatment was needed,” Weng said.

- All 16 Runners Who Collapsed and Runner Who Died at Brooklyn Half Marathon Said They Were VaccinatedAlmonds reduce the risk of heart disease, research showAston University (UK)  June 30, 2022Scientists have found that eating almonds in your diet can reduce the risk of heart disease by keeping blood vessels healthy.Research found that they significantly increase the amount of antioxidants in the blood stream, reduce blood pressure and improve blood flow. 

- A control group ate what they normally would, while another group consumed snacks of 50g of almonds a day for one month.At the end of the study period, the group eating an almond-enriched diet had higher levels of antioxidants (alpha-tocopherol) in their blood stream, improved blood flow and lower blood pressure, potentially reducing their risk of heart disease.Taking Vitamin D during pregnancy could lower the risk of eczema in babiesUniversity of Southampton (UK), July 6, 2022Taking Vitamin D supplements during pregnancy could substantially reduce the chances of babies up to a year old suffering from atopic eczema, according to a new study by University of Southampton researchers.The research, published in the British Journal of Dermatology, revealed that babies had a lower risk of developing atopic eczema in their first year if their mothers took 1000 international units (IU) of Vitamin D a day from when they were 14 weeks pregnant until they delivered. 

- It is estimated that one in six children aged one to five has atopic eczema, and there has been a global rise over recent decades.More than 700 pregnant women took part in the research—with 352 taking the supplements from 14 weeks until they gave birth and 351 taking a placebo.“Our results showed that babies of mothers who received supplements had a lower chance of having atopic eczema at 12 months, which supports recommendations for Vitamin D supplements to be routine during pregnancy.”Student of Neuroscience Shows How Meditation may Vanquish Mental DisordersUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School, July 3, 2022According to theNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 7.7 million Americans suffer from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder – approximately 3.3% of the US population when combined.

- Professor Min Du and his co-workers demonstrated that mice fed a diet containing 0.1% resveratrol were able to change their excess white fat into the active, energy-burning ‘beige’ fat.The researchers also showed that an enzyme called AMPK, which regulates the body’s energy metabolism, stimulates this transition of white fat into the brown-like fat.“We provide evidence that resveratrol induces the formation of brown-like adipocytes in mouse [white adipose tissue in the groin] by increasing the expression of genes specific to brown adipocytes and stimulating fatty acid oxidation, which appeared to be primarily mediated by AMPK-alpha1,” wrote the researchers in the International Journal of Obesity   “These data demonstrate, in addition to the inhibition of adipogenesis and stimulation of lipolysis, a novel browning role of resveratrol in white adipose tissue, which contributes to the beneficial effects of resveratrol in metabolism.Higher serum antioxidant vitamins predict lower risk of respiratory illness and mortalityNational Institutes of Health, July 1 2022.A pooled analysis published in Respiratory Research concluded that having lower serum levels of vitamins C and E was associated with a greater risk of suffering from wheeze or respiratory diseases, and that lower vitamin A, C and D were associated with an increased risk of dying from respiratory diseases.Paivi M. Salo and colleagues analyzed data from 16,218 men and women who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III), and 17,838 adults who were continuous NHANES participants who had information available concerning at least one serum antioxidant vitamin level. 

- Among smokers, lower levels of the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E were associated with increased wheeze and chronic bronchitis/emphysema.A higher risk of death from chronic lower respiratory disease was associated with lower levels of vitamin C. Among smokers with lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, chronic lower respiratory disease and influenza/pneumonia deaths were increased.

- Broccoli Reduces Your Risk of Four Major DiseasesUniversity of Illinois, June 23, 2022It's one of the most advantageous veggies you can eat, and love it or hate it, broccoli offers an array of health benefits. 

- Consumption of phenolic compounds, including certain flavonoids, is associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease, type II diabetes, asthma, and cancer.Sulforaphane in broccoli can also help to prevent or slow the progress of one of the most common forms of arthritis. 

- Many studies have shown that a diet rich in vegetables -- particularly brassica vegetables such as broccoli -- is linked to decreased risk of heart disease and stroke.The researchers crossed two broccoli lines and tested their progeny in terms of total phenolic content and their ability to neutralize oxygen radicals in cellular assays. 

- They then used a genetic technique called quantitative trait locus analysis to search for the genes involved in generating phenolics in the most promising progeny.By identifying the genes involved in accumulating these compounds, the researchers are one step closer to breeding broccoli and related Brassica vegetables like kale and cabbage with mega-doses of phenolic compounds.The good news is that phenolic compounds are flavorless and stable, meaning the vegetables can be cooked without losing health-promoting qualities.Once these vegetables are consumed, the phenolic compounds are absorbed and targeted to certain areas of the body or concentrated in the liver.

- Despite the variability in these techniques, they all seem to produce various psychological benefits on healthy and clinical populations, such as the reduction of perceived stress , the alleviation of depression, decreases in anxiety, or to help in coping with a chronic medical disease. 

- However, it is less clear what are the mechanisms underpinning the self-reported benefits of MBIs.Noting that there is some speculation that “MBIs increase gray matter in the brain regions related to emotion regulation, learning, memory, self-referential processes, and perspective taking,” they acknowledged the evidence is not conclusive and set out to delve deeper into the genetic expressions of stress and how MBIs may affect them.The review analyzed 18 studies “that used gene expression analysis in research on meditation and related MBIs [mind-body interventions].” Ultimately, they found that “meditation and related MBIs [were associated with] downregulation of NF-κB-targeted genes, which can be understood as the reversal of the molecular signature of the effects of chronic stress.”h useful information unless the relationship between gene expression and psychological variables is directly explored.”Curcumin-piperine combo may support heart health for diabetics: StudyBaqiyatallah University of Medical Science (Iran), June 25, 2022A combination supplement containing curcuminoids plus piperine from black pepper may support heart health for diabetics by improving the levels and functionality of cholesterol, says a new study.The combination reduced total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol levels, and improved levels of Lp(a) [Lipoprotein(a)], a structural component of LDL.“Although elevated Lp(a) has been considered as an important risk factor for premature atherosclerotic CVD for quite a long time independently of LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels, until very recently, the possibilities of influencing Lp(a) were extremely limited,” wrote scientists from Iran, Croatia and the USA in Complementary Therapies in Medicine .“Hence, this finding that curcuminoids as naturally occurring dietary supplements can decrease elevated Lp(a) in patients with [type 2 diabetes] is very important since such supplements are becoming more and more popular and attractive to the patients.”On the other hand, the curcumin-piperine combination significantly increased HDL levels by 1.56 mg/dL, compared to only 0.2 mg/dL in the placebo group.Parkinson's is partly an autoimmune disease, study findsColumbia University, June 21, 2022Researchers have found direct evidence that autoimmunity—in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues—plays a role in Parkinson's disease, the neurodegenerative movement disorder. 

- The findings raise the possibility that the death of neurons in Parkinson's could be prevented by therapies that dampen the immune response.The study, led by scientists at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) and the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, was published in Nature. 

- "These findings, however, could provide a much-needed diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease, and could help us to identify individuals at risk or in the early stages of the disease. 

- However, in a 2014 study, Dr. Sulzer's lab demonstrated that dopamine neurons (those affected by Parkinson's disease) are vulnerable because they have proteins on the cell surface that help the immune system recognize foreign substances. 

- As a result, they concluded, T cells had the potential to mistake neurons damaged by Parkinson's disease for foreign invaders.The new study found that T cells can be tricked into thinking dopamine neurons are foreign by the buildup of damaged alpha-synuclein proteins, a key feature of Parkinson's disease. 

- "In most cases of Parkinson's, dopamine neurons become filled with structures called Lewy bodies, which are primarily composed of a misfolded form of alpha-synuclein," said Dr. Sulzer.Vegetarian diets produce fewer greenhouse gases and increase longevity, say new studiesLoma Linda Health University, June 25, 2022Consuming a plant-based diet results in a more sustainable environment and reduces greenhouse gas emissions, while improving longevity, according to new research from Loma Linda University Health.Based on findings that identified food systems as a significant contributor to global warming, the study focuses on the dietary patterns of vegetarians, semi-vegetarians and non-vegetarians to quantify and compare greenhouse gas emissions, as well as assess total mortality.The mortality rate for non-vegetarians was almost 20 percent higher than that for vegetarians and semi-vegetarians. 

- Modifying the consumption of animal-based foods can therefore be a feasible and effective tool for climate change mitigation and public health improvements, the study concluded. 

- "The takeaway message is that relatively small reductions in the consumption of animal products result in non-trivial environmental benefits and health benefits," said Sam Soret, Ph.D., MPH, associate dean at Loma Linda University School of Public Health and co-author of the studies. 

- The level of detail we have on food consumption and health outcomes at the individual level makes these findings unprecedented,” Soret said.

- New research reveals that molecules derived from avocados could be effective in treating a form of cancer.Professor Paul Spagnuolo from the University of Waterloo has discovered a lipid in avocados that combats acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by targeting the root of the disease – leukemia stem cells. 

- Worldwide, there are few drug treatments available to patients that target leukemia stem cells.“The stem cell is really the cell that drives the disease,” said Professor Spagnuolo, in Waterloo’s School of Pharmacy. 

- “The stem cell is largely responsible for the disease developing and it’s the reason why so many patients with leukemia relapse. 

- We’ve performed many rounds of testing to determine how this new drug works at a molecular level and confirmed that it targets stem cells selectively, leaving healthy cells unharmed.”Inability to stand on one leg for 10 seconds in mid to later life linked to near doubling in risk of deathExercise Medicine Clinic-CLINIMEX (Brazil) and University of Eastern Finland, June 21, 2022The inability to stand on one leg for 10 seconds in mid- to later life is linked to a near doubling in the risk of death from any cause within the next 10 years, finds research published online in the British Journal of Sports MedicineThis simple and safe balance test could be included in routine health checks for older adults, say the researchers.The researchers wanted to find out whether a balance test might be a reliable indicator of a person’s risk of death from any cause within the next decade, and, as such, might therefore merit inclusion in routine health checks in later life.Participants were asked to stand on one leg for 10 seconds without any additional support.To improve standardization of the test, participants were asked to place the front of the free foot on the back of the opposite lower leg, while keeping their arms by their sides and their gaze fixed straight ahead. 

- In other words, people in this age group were more than 11 times as likely to fail the test as those just 20 years younger.During an average monitoring period of 7 years, 123 (7%) people died: cancer (32%); cardiovascular disease (30%); respiratory disease (9%); and COVID-19 complications (7%). 

- As Paul Breslin, one of the study’s authors at Rutgers noted, while cancerous cells died, healthy cells were not harmed, but rather the oleocanthal “put them to sleep.” The lifecycle of healthy cells was only temporarily affected in this way, without any negative observations and in approximately 24 hours, the healthy cells resumed their life cycle.Sports, not screens: The key to happier, healthier childrenUniversity of South Australia, June 21, 2022Whether it’s sports practice, music lessons or a casual catch up with friends, when children are involved in after-school activities, they’re more likely to feel happier and healthier than their counterparts who are glued to a screen.In a new study conducted by the University of South Australia, researchers found that children’s well-being is heightened when they participate in extra-curricular activities, yet lowered when they spent time on social media or playing video games.Published in BMC Pediatrics, the study analyzed data from 61,759 school students in years 4 to 9, assessing the average number of days per week children participated in after-school activities (3–6pm), and measure these against well-being factors—happiness, sadness, worry, engagement, perseverance, optimism, emotion regulation, and life satisfaction.It found that most students watched TV about four days of the school week and spent time on social media about three days of the week.Our study highlights how some out-of-school activities can boost children’s well-being, while others—particularly screens—can chip away at their mental and physical health.

- The study, conducted by researchers from the Department of Pharmacology at the Government Medical College in Bhavnagar, India, assessed groups of people who took curcumin capsules and Prozac, either individually or combined. 

- The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, a questionnaire designed to gauge the severity of a person’s depression level, was given to assess any changes in mood among the individuals who participated in this study.The findings showed that curcumin worked just as well as Prozac, acting as the “first clinical evidence that curcumin may be used as an effective and safe modality for treatment in patients with MDD without concurrent suicidal ideation or other psychotic disorders.” (1, 3) MDD stands for “Major Depressive Disorder.”Monkeys that eat omega-3 rich diet show more developed brain networksUniversity of Oregon, June 13, 2022Study gives new insight into similarity of complex brain networks in monkeys, humansMonkeys that ate a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids had brains with highly connected and well organized neural networks — in some ways akin to the neural networks in healthy humans — while monkeys that ate a diet deficient in the fatty acids had much more limited brain networking, according to an Oregon Health & Science University study.The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, provides further evidence for the importance of omega-3 fatty acids in healthy brain development.

- Around 6.5% of the participants also had a reduced physical quality of life.TIA patients who showed signs of PTSD were also more likely to show signs of depression, anxiety and a lower overall quality of life than those who did not.Exercise linked to brain cell growth and improved memoryUniversity of Jyvaskyla (Finland), June 14, 2022New research out of the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland has shown that exercise helps with preserving brain cells and preventing loss of memory, cognitive issues and general memory problems.In the Finnish study, aerobic activity in particular was found to support healthier brain cells and prevent memory problems better than other exercise types studied, including weight lifting and high-intensity interval training (HIIT).While weight lifting and HIIT have better fat burning properties, moderate aerobic exercise seems to cultivate healthier brain cells and protect against loss of memory.For the study, University of Jyvaskyla researchers put groups of rats on three different workout programs to determine their effects on memory and overall brain health. 

- By contrast, the running group demonstrated growth in brain cells as well as a reduction in the loss of memory and memory problems.Organic food consumers have a 21% lower risk of pre-eclampsiaNorwegian Institute of Public Health, June 15, 2022Pregnant women may be able to lower their risk of a potentially deadly complication known as pre-eclampsia by more than 20 percent simply by eating more organic vegetables, according to a study conducted by researchers from the National Institute for Consumer Research and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and published in BMJ Open.“The result is intriguing and supports that diet during pregnancy can influence the risk of pre-eclampsia,” researcher Hanne Torjusen, PhD, said.Pre-eclampsia is a complication of late pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine. 

- The cause of the condition is not known, although it has been linked to a variety of risk factors including some of the same risk factors as cardiovascular disease. 

- George Carlin – It’s A BIG Club & You Ain’t In It!Active Component of Grape Seed Extract Effective Against Cancer CellsUniversity of Colorado Cancer Center, June 13 2022A University of Colorado Cancer Center study published online ahead of print in the journal Nutrition and Cancer describes the laboratory synthesis of the most active component of grape seed extract, B2G2, and shows this synthesized compound induces the cell death known as apoptosis in prostate cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed.“We’ve shown similar anti-cancer activity in the past with grape seed extract (GSE), but now we know B2G2 is its most biologically active ingredient which can be synthesized in quantities that will allow us to study the detailed death mechanism in cancer cells,” says Alpna Tyagi, PhD, of the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.The group pinpointed B2G2 as the most active compound, but, “it’s expensive and it takes a long time to isolate B2G2 from grape seed extract,” Tyagi says.This expense related to the isolation of B2G2 has limited the group’s further exploration. 

- The current study reports the success of this effort, including the ability to synthesize gram-quantity of B2G2 reasonably quickly and inexpensively.In the paper’s second half, the group shows anti-cancer activity of synthesized B2G2 similar in mechanism and degree to overall GSE effectiveness.Improving Memory Naturally: Sage Contains Similar Compounds as Modern Alzheimer’s DrugsNewcastle and Northumbria Universities, June 14 2022Sage was named “Herb of the Year” in 2001 by the International Herb Association.Some of the latest research shows how sage can boost memory and cognitive health.

- An international study surveying more than 100,000 individuals in 21 countries found that people who sat for six to eight hours a day had a 12–13 percent increased risk for early death and heart disease, while those who sat for more than eight hours daily increased that to a sobering 20 percent.Their research followed individuals over an average of 11 years and determined that high amounts of sitting time were associated with increased risk of early death and cardiovascular disease.Not surprising, those who sat the most and were the least active had the highest risk—up to 50 percent—while those who sat the most but were also the most active had a substantially lower risk of about 17 percent.“For those sitting more than four hours a day, replacing a half hour of sitting with exercise reduced the risk by two percent,” Lear notes. 

- “With only one in four Canadians meeting the activity guidelines there’s a real opportunity here for people to increase their activity and reduce their chances of early death and heart disease.”Acupuncture Can Treat Alzheimer’s DiseaseHubei University of Chinese Medicine (China), June 5, 2022An increasing number of clinical and animal studies have confirmed that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. 

- Moxibustion is reported to be more effective than electro-acupuncture for improving space-recognizing memory ability in aged mice, suggesting that moxibustion is another alternative or complementary therapy used to treat Alzheimer’s disease.Dr. 

- Yanjun Du and team from Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, China only used suspended moxibustion (also named warming moxibustion, scarring moxibustion, or herb-partition moxibustion) on Baihui and Shenshu  acupoints to observe the action of pre-moxibustion on preventing apoptosis in a rat model of Alzheimer’s disease.The pre-moxibustion group was treated with moxibustion for eight courses (each course lasting for 6 days) prior to the exposure and 14 days after Aβ1–42 exposure. 

- Moxibustion prior to Aβ1–42 exposure was more effective than moxibustion after Aβ1–42 exposure in protecting the neuronal structure and lowering the apoptosis rate.Their findings indicate that a combination of preventive and therapeutic moxibustion has a beneficial effect for the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease development.Men and women with brain condition could be helped by vitamin ECangzhou Central Hospital (China), June 15 2022.Leukoaraiosis is an abnormality in the brain’s white matter that appears on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as white matter hyperintensities. 

- In an article published in the International Journal of Neuroscience, researchers at Cangzhou Central Hospital in Hebei, China reported improvements in factors related to leukoaraiosis among adults given supplements containing vitamin E.“Leukoaraiosis (LA) is a disease manifested by demyelination and gliosis in white matter, mainly caused by cerebrovascular diseases,” Yan Wang and colleagues wrote. 

- At the end of the treatment period, blood samples were evaluated for the inflammatory factors C-reactive protein, complement C3 and C4, and matrix metalloproteins 2 and 9, as well as for markers of oxidative stress and endothelial function (function of the lining of the arteries, which is impaired in cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease).Inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial function improved in all groups that received vitamin E in comparison with the placebo. 

- Improvement in all measured factors was correlated with higher doses of vitamin E.Chlorogenic acid plus chromium improves insulin resistance and lowers obesity in miceUniversity of Toledo, June 10 2022In an article published in Nutrition & Metabolism, University of Toledo researchers report that a combination of chromium and chlorogenic acid (CGA), a polyphenol occurring in coffee, reversed the development of obesity and insulin resistance in mice caused by the intake of a high-fat diet.Sonia M. Najjar and her associates fed male BL6 mice a standard diet or a high-fat diet for seven weeks. 

- Body weight was measured weekly, insulin tolerance was assessed at four and seven weeks, and glucose and glucose tolerance were assessed at the end of the treatment period.At four weeks, animals supplemented with chlorogenic acid and the combination of chlorogenic acid and chromium experienced weight loss within two weeks, and attained weights comparable to those of animals that received a standard diet. 

- New Rule: The Misinformation Age | Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO)Acai and brain health: Has study unlocked Amazonian fruit’s neuroprotective effects?University of Adelaide, June 10, 2022The potential brain health benefits of açai may be linked to an inhibition of the aggregation of beta-amyloid proteins, says a new study from Australia.The build-up of plaque from beta-amyloid deposits is associated with an increase in brain cell damage and death from oxidative stress. 

- Men and women who eat at least 10 grams of nuts or peanuts per day have a lower risk of dying from several major causes of death than people who don’t consume nuts or peanuts.The reduction in mortality was strongest for respiratory disease, neurodegenerative disease, and diabetes, followed by cancer and cardiovascular diseases. 

- It also showed lower cardiovascular fitness in 12- to 15-year-olds who consumed more ultraprocessed foods.Although previous research has shown that consuming ultraprocessed foods is linked with a higher risk for cardiovascular disease in adults, this is one of the first studies to show a link between consumption of these foods and lower levels of physical fitness in children.Ultraprocessed foods were categorized in this study as including packaged snacks, breakfast cereals, candies, soda, sweetened juices and yogurts, canned soups and prepared foods like pizza, hotdogs, burgers and chicken nuggets.For children 5 years old and under, the researchers used locomotor development as a measure of physical fitness. 

- The study showed that teens and preteens with good cardiovascular fitness consumed 226 fewer calories daily from ultraprocessed foods than those who did not have healthy cardiovascular fitness.Qatar Omicron-wave study shows slow decline of natural immunity, rapid decline of vaccine immunityWeill Cornell Medical College,, June 15, 2022A recent Pfizer or Moderna mRNA-vaccine booster provided good but temporary protection against infection by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, according to a study from researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine—Qatar.In the study, published June 15 in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers analyzed the Omicron wave in Qatar last winter, comparing prior infections, vaccine immunity and combinations thereof among more than 100,000 Omicron-infected and non-infected individuals.The analysis showed vaccine immunity against new infection appeared to wane rapidly, whereas people with a prior-variant infection were moderately protected from Omicron with little decline in protection even a year after their prior infection.A key finding was that a history of vaccination with the standard two doses of either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccine, but no history of prior infection, brought no significant protection against symptomatic omicron infection.

- Replacing sugar-sweetened beverages with water, and non-sugar-sweetened coffee or tea could significantly lower liver cancer risk.”For the new study, researchers analyzed data from 90,504 postmenopausal women who participated in the Women’s Health Initiative, a long-term study launched in the early 1990s. 

- Researchers assessed sugar-sweetened beverage intake based on validated food frequency questionnaires and confirmed liver cancer diagnoses using participants’ medical records.About 7% of participants reported consuming one or more 12-ounce servings of sugar-sweetened beverages per day and a total of 205 women developed liver cancer. 

- But what if you could stop this degenerative disease in its tracks?A world-first study from the University of South Australia could make this a reality as new genetic research shows a direct link between dementia and a lack of vitamin D.Investigating the association between vitamin D, neuroimaging features, and the risk of dementia and stroke, the study found:low levels of vitamin D were associated with lower brain volumes and an increased risk of dementia and strokegenetic analyses supported a causal effect of vitamin D deficiency and dementia.in some populations as much as 17% of dementia cases might be prevented by increasing everyone to normal levels of vitamin D (50 nmol/L).Flaxseed supplements linked to improved blood pressure: Meta-analysisUniversity of Medicine and Pharmacy (Romania), June 9, 2022Supplements of flaxseed may effectively management blood pressure, says a new meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials.Data from 1,302 participants indicated that flaxseed supplements are associated with significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of about 2.85 mmHg and 2.39 mmHg, respectively.“The results obtained in the present meta-analysis – a decrease of 2.85/2.39 mmHg after flaxseed supplementation – might be valuable for the hypertension management using nutraceuticals, since Heart Outcome Evaluation study demonstrated that a 3.3/1.4 mmHg reduction was associated with a 22% decline of relative risk of cardiovascular mortality,” wrote scientists from Romania, Iran, Australia and Poland in Clinical Nutrition .The scientists also report that supplementation for longer than 12 weeks resulted in even greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 3.10 mmHg and 2.62 mmHg, respectively, compared to trials of shorter duration.The potential biological mechanism are not completely understood, said the researchers, but could be linked to the lignan content of flaxseed. 

- On the other hand, lignan extracts was not associated with any changes in SBP and DBP, they said.Keep calm and carry on — for the sake of your long-term healthPenn State University, June 9, 2022Reacting positively to stressful situations may play a key role in long-term health, according to researchers.In a study measuring adults’ reactions to stress and how it affects their bodies, researchers found that adults who fail to maintain positive moods such as cheerfulness or calm when faced with the minor stressors of everyday life appear to have elevated levels of inflammation. 

- “It is how a person reacts to stress that is important.”In the short-term, with illness or exercise, the body experiences a high immune response to help repair itself. 

- Individuals who have trouble regulating their responses may be at risk for certain age-related conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, frailty and cognitive decline, Sin said.“To our knowledge, this paper is the first to link biomarkers of inflammation with positive mood responses to stressors in everyday life,” said Jennifer E. Graham-Engeland, associate professor of biobehavioral health, Penn State.For breast cancer prevention, diet quality mattersHealthy, plant-based diet linked with lower cancer risk for postmenopausal womenParis-Saclay University (France), June 14, 2022Research shows that what we eat can influence our cancer risk, but it’s not always clear which foods or dietary patterns are best for cancer prevention. 

- Although some studies suggest diets with less or no meat consumption offer health benefits, results have been somewhat mixed. 

- For the new study, researchers focused on differentiating between healthy plant-based foods — such as whole grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, legumes, vegetable oils and tea or coffee — and plant-based foods the study categorized as less healthy including fruit juices, refined grains, potatoes, sugar-sweetened beverages and desserts.Regular exercise beneficial in suppressing inflammation in rheumatic diseaseExercise results in physiological changes that decrease inflammation on a local and systemic levelOhio State University, June 12, 202Research findings suggest that exercise transiently suppresses local and systemic inflammation, reinforcing the beneficial effects of exercise and the need for this to be regular in order to achieve clinical efficacy in rheumatic disease.These new research findings focused on the physiological changes created by exercise and their impact on inflammation. 

- The researchers have found that exercise generates a true biological response and induces changes on a molecular level that stimulate anti-inflammatory effects.This in-vivo study measured the regulation and activation of NF-kB* in mice. 

- NF-kB, a protein complex that controls many genes involved in inflammation, is found to be chronically active in many inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis.The effect of exercise on the inhibition of NF-kB activation was identified as a transient effect, lasting only 24 hours after exercise.The role of exercise in inhibiting NF-kB activation was linked to the suppression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines.Keeping the faith – or your willingness to push yourself – as you grow olderNorwegian University of Science and Technology, June 14, 2022So you could have become a pro footballer when you were younger, you say? 

- And nut consumption has been associated with cardiovascular healthand mortality in other research.Stress accelerates immune aging, study findsUniversity of Southern California, June 13, 2022Stress—in the form of traumatic events, job strain, everyday stressors and discrimination—accelerates aging of the immune system, potentially increasing a person’s risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease and illness from infections such as COVID-19, according to a new USC study.The research, published  in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), could help explain disparities in age-related health, including the unequal toll of the pandemic, and identify possible points for intervention.USC researchers decided to see if they could tease out a connection between lifetime exposure to stress—a known contributor to poor health—and declining vigor in the immune system.As expected, people with higher stress scores had older-seeming immune profiles, with lower percentages of fresh disease fighters and higher percentages of worn-out white blood cells. 

- The association between stressful life events and fewer ready to respond, or naive, T cells remained strong even after controlling for education, smoking, drinking, BMI and race or ethnicity.CoQ10 supplementation associated with lower pro-inflammatory factors in randomized trialShahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences (Iran), June 8 2022.A double-blind trial reported in a recent issue of the International Journal of Vitamin and Nutrition Research found a reduction in markers of inflammation in mildly hypertensive patients given coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) for twelve weeks. 

- Participants who received CoQ10 also experienced an increase in adiponectin: a protein secreted by adipose tissue that has an anti-inflammatory effect and which has been found to be reduced in high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.“Considering that coenzyme Q10 has attracted noticeable attention in recent years for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension in regard to its effect on inflammatory factors such as cytokines, it is therefore hypothesized that supplementation with coenzyme Q10 reduces the proinflammatory factors,” write Nasim Bagheri Nesami of Iran’s Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences and colleagues. 

- Plasma adiponectin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP, a marker of inflammation) and the cytokines interleukin 2, interleukin6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured before and after treatment.At the end of the study, participants who received CoQ10 had significant declines in interleukin-6 and hs-CRP compared with levels measured upon enrollment. 

- Hepatic encephalopathy is a deterioration of brain function that is a serious complication of liver disease.“This rigorous new research finds that probiotics modify the gut microbiota to prevent hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis of the liver,” said David W. Victor III, MD. 

- “These results offer a safe, well-tolerated and perhaps cheaper alternative to current treatments.”When comparing treatment with probiotics versus placebo, the researchers found that the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was lower in patients treated with probiotics. 

- The effectiveness of lactulose, a nonabsorbable disaccharide, is limited by side effects (diarrhea, bloating and gas) and a narrow therapeutic window.Chelation therapy and vitamin supplements cut heart disease risk by over 25%Columbia University, June 9, 2022 A combination of high-dose multivitamins and chelation therapy may protect heart attack survivors from future cardiovascular events and death, according to a multicenter study published in the American Heart Journal.Intravenous chelation, in which the chemical ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is injected into the bloodstream in order to bind to minerals and help flush them from the body, is an FDA-approved treatment for heavy metal poisoning that was first used during World War I.“They’re all in our environment. 

- And as you get older and become osteoporotic, that lead starts getting released.”In a randomized, double-blind trial, the researchers randomly assigned 1,708 stable heart attack survivors at 134 clinics across the United States to one of four experimental conditions: high-dose oral multivitamins plus chelation, chelation plus a vitamin-mimicking placebo, vitamins plus a chelation-mimicking placebo or double placebo. 

- Among diabetics, chelation resulted in a 41 percent reduction in primary endpoint, while chelation plus vitamins resulted in a 51 percent reduction. 

- “These applications are attributable to its versatile properties including anti-inflammatory, anti-biofilm, analgesic, anti-edemic, and fibrinolytic effects.”Serrapeptase has been used for a wide range of health concerns:Serrapeptase for Joint SwellingSerrapeptase is effective in reducing post-operative joint swelling in comparison to other therapies such as applying ice.Serrapeptase Dissolves Blood Clots, Dead Tissue, BiofilmsAnticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs are used for managing cardiovascular diseases but they are unable to dissolve an existing blood clot. 

- Studies have shown that serrapeptase can digest dead tissues, blood clots, cysts, biofilm and arterial plaques.Serrapeptase for Acute or Chronic Ear, Nose and Throat ConditionsThe Journal of International Medical Research published the results of a study evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of serrapeptase using a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 193 subjects suffering from acute or chronic ear, nose or throat disorders. 

- It was concluded that serrapeptase “has anti-inflammatory, anti-oedemic and fibrinolytic activity and acts rapidly on localized inflammation.”COVID-19 and Chronic Respiratory ConditionsA 2021 study, showed, “Proteolytic enzymes can be useful in the treatment of nosocomial, viral, and resistant infections, especially in pediatric and geriatric age groups due to its relative safety, less tolerance and resistance and its synergic effects.”Physicians have observed many COVID-19 cases with heart problems, kidney problems, and the presence of blood clots.

- “Pure” oil of lemon eucalyptus (essential oil not formulated as a repellent) is not recommended; it has not undergone similar, validated testing for safety and efficacy and is not registered with EPA as an insect repellent.”Just 5 Minutes Of Breath Training Every Day Makes Exercise Easier For AdultsUniversity of Colorado, June 11, 2022A handheld device which builds breathing muscles could help older people get in shape. 

- Adults are recommended to log 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week. 

- “High-resistance IMST (high-resistance inspiratory muscle strength training) may be one such strategy to promote adherence and improve multiple components of health in midlife and older adults.”IMST involves inhaling through a handheld device which adds resistance to the breath. 

- Participants in the high-resistance group also showed a relationship with changes in 18 metabolites tested in the study, “predominantly ones that play key roles in energy production and fatty acid metabolism.”Pregnant women produce super antibodies to protect newborns, now scientists know howCincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, June 8, 2022Scientists discovered years ago that newborn infants depend upon immune components transferred from their mothers to survive the onslaught of pathogens that begin invading their bodies as soon as they are born.Now, a far-reaching study published in Nature, provides a surprising explanation of how those early days of mother-provided immunity actually work–and what that information could mean for preventing death and disability from a wide range of infectious diseases.“For many years, scientists believed that antibodies cannot get inside cells. 

- But, evidence is accumulating that hypersensitivity to electromagnetic fields can cause high blood sugar, raising the possibility that a third form of the disease – “type 3 diabetes” – could be caused by this form of environmental pollution.Case studies show that high blood sugar is triggered by exposure to “dirty electricity”According to peer-reviewed research  published in Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine, “dirty electricity,” or transient electrical fields, can affect blood sugar levels in diabetic individuals who are electrically sensitive.Dr. 

- This is stated in a study published in the journal Molecular Nutrition and Food Research, carried out by the Research Group at the University of Barcelona and the CIBER on Fragility and Healthy AgeingThe study shows the interaction between polyphenols and gut microbiota can induce the proliferation of bacteria with the ability to synthetize beneficial metabolites, such as IPA, a postbiotic with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties that contributes to improve the health of the intestinal wall. 

- Therefore, this compound would contribute to the prevention of some diseases associated with ageing.“If we consider the beneficial effects of IPA on the gut microbiota and health in general, it is important to find reliable strategies to promote the production of this metabolite.As part of the study, the researchers carried out a multiomic analysis on faecal samples of fifty-one volunteers aged over sixty-five who kept following a diet rich in polyphenols (green tea, bitter chocolate, fruits including apples, pomegranate and blueberries) for eight weeks.The results show that the diet rich in polyphenols generated a significant increase in the blood IPA levels, together with a decrease in inflammation levels and changes in the bacteria of the microbiota, from the order of Bacteroidales.Study shows people with a high omega-3 DHA level in their blood are at 49% lower risk of Alzheimer’sFatty Acid Research Institute, June 9, 2022New research published today in Nutrients shows that people with a higher blood DHA level are 49% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease vs. those with lower levels, according to the Fatty Acid Research Institute (FARI). 

- The study, led by Aleix Sala-Vila, PhD, suggested that providing extra dietary omega-3 DHA, especially for those carrying the ApoE4 gene (which approximately doubles an individual’s susceptibility to develop AD) might slow the development of the disease. 

- Such a cost-effective, low-risk dietary intervention like this could potentially save billions in health care costs.In this prospective observational study conducted within the Framingham Offspring Cohort — including 1490 dementia-free participants aged ≥65 years old —  researchers examined the association of red blood cell (RBC) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with incident Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), while also testing for an interaction with APOE-ε4 carriership.Tthe researchers noted that an increased intake of DHA might lower risk for developing AD, particularly in higher-risk individuals such as those carrying the APOE-ε4 allele, suggesting that they may benefit more from higher DHA levels than non-carriers.Vegan diet rich in legumes beneficial for decreased weight in new studyPhysicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, June 8, 2022A vegan diet improves diet quality, leading to decreased weight and improved insulin sensitivity, according to a new study by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. 

- Decreased weight was most associated with increased intake of legumes and decreased intake of meat, fish, and poultry.“Our research shows that the best way to improve the quality of your health is to improve the quality of the foods you eat,” says Hana Kahleova, MD, PhD, director of clinical research at the Physicians Committee and a study co-author. 

- Equally concerning are the health risks associated with T2DM, including heart disease and stroke.In T2DM, there are insufficient levels of insulin, a hormone that regulates movement of glucose into peripheral cells. 

- The result is an unhealthy accumulation of glucose in the blood.Collectively, the scientists' findings suggest that a prolonged exposure to high levels of glycerate due to excessive consumption of western diets rich in dietary fructose and fat poses the risk of damage to the pancreatic islet cells and development of diabetes.New study associates intake of dairy milk with greater risk of prostate cancerLoma Linda University, June 9, 2022Men with higher intakes of dairy foods, especially milk, face a significantly higher risk of prostate cancer compared to men with lower intakes, according to a new study conducted by researchers at Loma Linda University Health.

- (NEXT)Sweet cherry anthocyanins support liver health… for rats at leastZhei-Jang University (China), June 1, 2022Anthocyanins from sweet cherries may protect against diet-induced liver steatosis, or excessive amounts of fat in the liver’s tissue, says a new study with rats.The study, published in the journal Nutrition, built upon the abundant existing literature on the beneficial role anthocyanins have as an antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hyperlipidemic component. 

- The condition known as liver steatosis is a common non-alcoholic fatty liver disease usually treated with drugs, but according to the researchers, some drug used for treatment “are usually accompanied by some adverse effect.” For 15 weeks, the researchers investigated the effects of sweet cherry anthocyanin supplementation have on alleviating high-fat diet-induced liver steatosis in rodents to explore the possibility of a none-drug treatment for the liver condition. 

- According to the researchers, the results demonstrated how sweet cherry anthocyanins may be developed into a supplement to “protect from high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice,”leading to a suggested potential for the anthocyanin’s application in the “treatment of hepatic steatosis and other obesity related metabolic disorders.”(NEXT)Bad dreams could be early warning of Parkinson’s diseaseUniversity of Birmingham, June 8, 2022Older adults who start to experience bad dreams or nightmares could be exhibiting the earliest signs of Parkinson’s disease, say researchers at the University of Birmingham. 

- A new study, published in eClinicalMedicine, showed that in a cohort of older men, individuals experiencing frequent bad dreams were twice as likely to be later diagnosed with Parkinson’s as those who did not.Previous studies have shown that people with Parkinson’s disease experience nightmares and bad dreams more frequently than adults in the general population, but using nightmares as a risk indicator for Parkinson’s has not previously been considered.”While we need to carry out further research in this area, identifying the significance of bad dreams and nightmares could indicate that individuals who experience changes to their dreams in older age—without any obvious trigger—should seek medical advice.” The team used data from a large cohort study from the U.S., which contained data over a period of 12 years from 3818 older men living independently. 

- Participants reporting bad dreams at least once per week were then followed up at the end of the study to see whether they were more likely to be diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. 

- (NEXT)Beetroot boosts sporting performance in athletesUniversity of South Australia, June 8, 2022Evaluating the performance effects of foods that are thought to have a beneficial effect on aerobic performance, researchers found that beetroot, grapes, sour cherries, and pine bark extract, which contribute to nitric oxide availability in the body, boost endurance exercise performance. 

- Assessing data from 118 studies involving 1,872 participants from 25 different countries, the meta-analysis evaluated the effect of consuming nitrate-rich foods (typically green leafy vegetables), foods that contain polyphenols (such as berries, cherries and cocoa), and L-Citrulline (found in watermelon) on exercise endurance performance. 

- The study, published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, found that the nitrate levels contained in beetroot, which have been shown to boost blood flow and increase the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to muscles during exercise, helped athletes perform better more quickly. 

- A study funded by Swiss company Stragen Pharma looks deeper into how this plum extract can benefit the liver.“Most of the currently available data supporting a potential hepatoprotective [liver protecting] effect of P. mume  have been obtained using in vitro testing, in vivo  animal models, or non-controled human trials,” the researchers wrote in the study published in Phythotherapy Research.Hence, the current study was the first that looked into the effects of two doses of a P. mune extract supplement on liver enzymes through a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.From the 44 subjects who participated throughout the 3-month long study, researchers found a “beneficial and statistically significant effect versus placebo of P. mune extract on liver function.”Researchers found that, over the course of the study, participants supplemented with the low dose of Prunus mume experienced significant decreases in their high aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase liver enzymes, all of which induce hepatotoxicity, whereas the high dose group did not experience significant changes in their liver enzymes.Dietary fiber in the gut may help with skin allergies, says new studyMonash University (Australia),A Monash University study exploring the emerging gut-skin axis has found that microbial fermentation of dietary fiber in the gut can protect against allergic skin disease. 

- Too much sitting leads to an increased risk of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and other chronic illnesses, including depression. 

- To offset the severe side effects of a sedentary lifestyle, doctors recommend adults complete at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise a week.However, a new study from San Diego State University, published in JAMA Network Open, found that doing lighter intensity daily activities such as household chores can significantly reduce the risk of stroke.“Light-intensity physical activity can include vacuuming, sweeping the floor, washing the car, leisure strolling, stretching, or playing catch,” said Steven Hooker, dean of SDSU’s College of Health and Human Services and lead researcher of the cohort study.They found those who were sedentary for 13 hours or more a day had a 44% increased risk of having a stroke.Uncovering why playing a musical instrument can protect brain healthBaycrest Center for Geriatric Care (Canada),A recent study conducted at Baycrest Health Sciences has uncovered a crucial piece into why playing a musical instrument can help older adults retain their listening skills and ward off age-related cognitive declines.

- This study assessed the efficacy of red ginseng on cognitive function and quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD).”Research from Seoul Medical Center stated “Fourteen patients with AD (mean age, 74.93 years; 11 women and 3 men) were recruited and treated with KRG (4.5 g per day) for 12 weeks. 

- EEG performed before and after treatment were analyzed with quantitative spectral analysis. 

- The Frontal Assessment Battery score improved significantly after 12 weeks of treatment. 

- In a recent issue of Nutrients and an upcoming publication of the International Journal of Molecular Medicine, Sang-Moo Kang reports the beneficial effects of ginseng, a well-known herbal medicine, on human health. 

- He partnered with a university and research institutes in South Korea that wanted international collaborative projects to study if ginseng can be used to improve health and protect against disease because of the potential benefit in fighting these viruses. 

- Also, treatment with red ginseng extract reduced the expression of genes that cause inflammation. 

- While many plant proteins are deficient in one or more essential amino acids necessary for optimal muscle growth and repair, a new randomized controlled study published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise shows that plant-derived proteins can still induce strong anabolic responses. 

- Researchers at Maastricht University, The Netherlands, found that consuming 30 grams of potato-derived protein concentrate following resistance exercise strongly increased muscle protein synthesis rates to levels that did not differ from the response following the ingestion of an equivalent amount of milk protein concentrate.

- (NEXT)Exercise amplifies immune attack on pancreatic cancerNew York University Langone Health, June 2Aerobic exercise reprograms the immune system to reduce pancreatic tumor growth and amplify the effects of immunotherapy, a new study finds. 

- Exercise-induced increases in levels of the hormone adrenalin cause changes to the immune system, say the study authors, including in the activity of cells that respond to signaling protein interleukin-15 (IL-15). 

- The current study found that exercise promotes the survival of CD8 T cells sensitive to IL-15, and doubles the number of them homing to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors in mice. 

- Other tests found that aerobic exercise for 30 minutes five times a week reduced the rate of cancer formation by 50 percent in one mouse model of PDAC, and reduced tumor weight by 25 percent in another model, in which mice ran on treadmills for three weeks. 

- Our findings show, for the first time, how aerobic exercise affects the immune microenvironment within pancreatic tumors,” says first author Emma Kurz, MD, Ph.D., at NYU Grossman School of Medicine’s Vilcek Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. 

- Other studies have examined the way that exercise affects the microbiome, but this study is one of few to examine the reverse — how gut bacteria also impact voluntary exercise behaviors. 

- Voluntary exercise involves both motivation and athletic ability. 

- In addition, the high runner mice did not recover their running behavior even 12 days after the antibiotic treatment stopped. 

- The interactive, searchable tool rates more than 84,000 foods and 5,000 ingredients based on nutrition, ingredient and processing concerns. 

- In most cases, the products’ trans fat content on the nutrition label doesn’t add up. 

- A single serving of more than 400 foods in the Food Scores database contained enough trans fat to exceed the World Health Organization’s recommended limit of less than 2 grams per day for an adult who consumed a 2,000 calorie diet, the analysis said. 

- The investigation included 171,616 men and women who did not have cancer or heart disease upon enrollment between 2006 to 2010 in the UK Biobank prospective cohort study. 

- “This prospective analysis found that moderate consumption of unsweetened coffee and that of sugar-sweetened coffee were associated with similar reductions in risk for all-cause, cancer-related, and cardiovascular disease-related mortality,” authors Dan Liu, MD, of Jinan University and colleagues concluded. 

- (Next)When is the best time of day to exercise? 

- The answer may be different for men and womenSkidmore CollegeWhen should I fit exercise within my daily schedule? 

- That’s because recent findings suggest that the effectiveness of exercise depends on the time of day (Exercise Time Of Day, ETOD). 

- Now, a randomized controlled trial not only confirms convincingly that ETOD affects the effectiveness of exercise, but also shows that these effects differ between types of exercise, and between women and men. 

- Principal investigator Dr. Paul J Arciero, a professor at the Health and Human Physiological Sciences Department  said: “Here we show for the first time that for women, exercise during the morning reduces belly fat and blood pressure, whereas evening exercise in women increases upper body muscular strength, power, and endurance, and improves overall mood and nutritional satiety.”(Next)Diabetes may weaken teeth and promote tooth decayRutgers University, May 31, 2022People with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are prone to tooth decay, and a new study from Rutgers may explain why: reduced strength and durability of enamel and dentin, the hard substance under enamel that gives structure to teeth.

- These important structures can be damaged by alcohol consumption, which can cause them to rupture and release their DNA, proteins and lipids, collectively known as “damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).”To understand more fully how alcohol damages mitochondria, and how this leads to mitophagy, researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) used an advanced imaging technique to investigate changes in mitochondrial function within the livers of mice that were exposed to alcohol. 

- Blocking depolarization after ethanol exposure also blocks mitophagy, preventing mitochondrial depletion.Flavonoids may slow lung function decline due to agingJohns Hopkins School of Public Health, May 22, 2022Previous research has shown that the plant-produced chemicals known as flavonoids have beneficial antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 

- Anthocyanins, the type of flavonoid investigated in the current study, have been detected in lung tissue shortly after being ingested, and in animals models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

- The plant chemicals appear to reduce mucus and inflammatory secretions.The researchers analyzed data from 463 adults (average age: 44) who participated in the second and third European Community Respiratory Health Surveys from 2002 to 2012. 

- However, in the first study of its kind, researchers found medication has no detectable impact on how much children with ADHD learn in the classroom.Approximately 10% of children in the U.S. are diagnosed with ADHD and more than 90% of them are prescribed stimulant medication as the main form of treatment in school settingsbecause most physicians believe that medication will result in better academic achievement.Researchers evaluated 173 children between the ages of 7 and 12 with ADHD participating in the center’s Summer Treatment Program, a comprehensive eight-week summer camp program for children with ADHD and related behavioral, emotional and learning challenges. 

- Each child was randomized to be medicated with a sustained-release stimulant medication during either the first or second of the instructional phases, receiving a placebo during the other.Contrary to expectations, researchers found that children learned the same amount of science, social studies, and vocabulary content whether they were taking the medication or the placebo.Mediterranean diet may blunt air pollution’s ill health effectsNYU School of Medicine May 21, 2022Eating a Mediterranean diet may protect people from some of the harm of long-term exposure to air pollution, and reduce their risk of dying from heart attacks, stroke and other causes of death, according to new research.The researchers analyzed data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Diet and Health Study. 

- During that time, 126,835 people in the study group died.The researchers created five groups of participants based on their level of adherence to a Mediterranean diet and linked participants to estimates of long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrous oxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) based on census tract information.When comparing those least and most adherent to a Mediterranean diet, the study found that:Deaths from all causes increased by 5 percent for every 10 parts per billion (ppb) increase in long-term average NO2 exposure in those least adherent, compared to 2 percent among the most adherent.Cardiovascular disease deaths increased by 17 percent for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3) increase in long-term average PM2.5 exposure in those least adherent, compared to 5 percent among the most adherent.Cardiovascular disease deaths increased by 10 percent for every 10 ppb increase in NO2. 

- exposure in those least adherent, compared to 2 percent among the most adherent.Heart attack deaths increased by 20 percent for every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure in those least adherent, compared to 5 percent among the most adherent.Heart attack deaths increased by 12 percent for every single ppb increase in NO2 exposure in those least adherent, compared to 4 percent among the most adherent.Why blueberries are an effective weapon in the war against Alzheimer’s disease University of Cincinnati,  May 21, 2022 Could a plump, little blueberry really hold colossal promise in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease? 

- New research adds to the growing evidence that blueberries, bursting with antioxidants, could help diminish the devastating defects of dementia.Newly released study findings show that certain flavonoids found in blueberries could also hold the key to lessening the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.The researchers, led by Krikorian, believe that blueberries’ beneficial effects against Alzheimer’s could be due to certain flavonoids found in the berries.

- Patients can experience nausea, difficulty breathing and dizziness at the thought of going to the dentist, during an examination, and following treatment.In a review of six trials with 800 patients, researchers used a points scale to measure anxiety and studies show that anxiety reduced by eight points when dental patients were given acupuncture as a treatment. 

- This level of reduction is considered to be clinically relevant, which means that acupuncture could be a possibility for tackling dental anxiety.Studies that compared anxiety levels between patients that received acupuncture and those that did not, showed a significant difference in anxiety scores during dental treatment. 

- During the last two months of the trial, the subjects participated in four health examinations that included blood pressure assessment and measurement of blood markers of inflammation, coagulation, endothelial function, oxidative stress, antioxidant activity, cardiometabolism and neuroendocrine stress response.Campus levels of fine particulate matter air pollution (PM 2.5) measured during the course of the trial averaged 38 micrograms per cubic meter. 

- The data generated will help identify people at high risk of developing sleep apnea and to find novel treatment strategies.Researchers in Umeå have shown that snorers and sleep apnea patients have neuromuscular injuries in the upper respiratory tract. 

- Sleep apnea is characterized by repeated collapse of the upper respiratory tract leading to respiratory arrest during sleep, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.The studies show that people who constantly snore heavily and have sleep apnea displayed a loss of nerves and muscle mass in the soft palate. 

- It becomes a vicious circle where snoring causes damage and at the same time disturb healing of injuries, which can lead to swallowing dysfunction and sleep apnea.Study: Tai chi can reduce hypertension symptoms in young and middle-aged in-service staffZhei-jian Hospital (China)Researchers from Zhejiang Hospital in China reported that practicing t’ai chi can help with hypertension.The treatment group practiced simplified t’ai chi for three months. 

- On the other hand, the control group underwent general daily lifestyle intervention.After one month of exercise, the participants who practiced t’ai chi experienced significant reductions in their systolic blood pressure, heart rate, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.At the end of the intervention period, the t’ai chi group experienced substantial decreases in their BMI, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. 

- Practicing t’ai chi also improved their quality of life.Lemongrass essential oil protects the liver from acetaminophen-induced injuryState University of Maringa (Brazil)A study published in The American Journal of Chinese Medicine found that the essential oil extracted from lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) can protect the liver from damage caused by acetaminophen intake.They pretreated mice with 125, 250, or 500 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of lemongrass essential oil or 200 mg/kg of a standard drug per day for seven days.Then, they induced liver toxicity by administering 250 mg/kg dose of acetaminophen.The researchers found that pretreatment with lemongrass essential oil significantly reduced the levels of liver disease markers alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP).Inflammation in the liver was also reduced by lemongrass essential oil.Liver lesions in mice were also improved after pretreatment with lemongrass essential oil.Pretreatment with lemongrass essential oil increased antioxidant activity in the liver. 

- Want to escape Alzheimer’s disease? 

- Run for your life and exerciseTel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Israel), May 20, 2022Exercise slows down aging of the brain and can reduce risks of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias by about half. 

- Long-term epidemiological and physical studies show that exercise can improve memory, concentration and mood and minimize pain, as well as reduce the risk of cognitive damage, stroke, Parkinson’s disease and depression.“These findings flew in the face of the belief that over the age of 30, the neurons decline irreversibly. 

- Today we know that the adult brain has many stem cells that when stimulated can differentiate and turn into ripe neurons that know how to create synapses.” The neurologist added that for some unknown reason, the best potential for differentiation exists in brain regions responsible for memory.Exercise promotes the secretion of trophic factors — including brain-derived neurotrophic factor that encourage the growth of stem cells that turn into adult nerve cells. 

- They are available in large quantities during a baby’s first years when the brain develops at a rapid pace, but the amounts decline during adolescence and aging.It was best to do aerobic exercise (causing the heart and lungs to exert themselves) along with non-aerobic exercise (strengthening the muscles on the skeleton) at least three times a week. 

- Even if you exercise just as an adult and the cognitive decline has begun, your physical activity will slow down the rate of decline.Orange juice is good for ageing brain: StudyUniversity of Reading (UK) May 19, 2022Drinking orange juice could help improve brain function in elderly people, says a new study.The study saw a group of 37 healthy adults (mean age 67 years) consuming 500 ml of orange juice daily over an eight week period. 

- During oil pulling, the oil gets emulsified and surface area of the oil gets increased.Paracetamol (Tyenol) in pregnancy may lower testosterone in unborn boysUniversity of Edinburgh, May 20th, 2022Prolonged paracetamol use by pregnant women may reduce testosterone production in unborn baby boys, research has found.Researchers say their findings could help to explain reported links between paracetamol use in pregnancy and reproductive health problems in young boys.The University of Edinburgh study tested the effect of paracetamol on testosterone production in mice that carried grafts of human testicular tissue. 

- They measured the amount of testosterone produced by the human tissue an hour after the final dose of paracetamol.They found there was no effect on testosterone production following 24 hours of paracetamol treatment. 

- After seven days of exposure, however, the amount of testosterone was reduced by 45 per cent.Natural plant chemicals in licorice root could help fight tooth decay, study showsUniversity of Edinburgh (Scotland), May 20, 2022Oral care products containing a natural chemical that stops bacteria harming teeth could help prevent decay, a study suggests.The plant natural product acts against harmful mouth bacteria and could improve oral health by helping to prevent the build-up of plaque, researchers say.The compound – known as trans-chalcone – is related to chemicals found in liquorice root. 

- Preventing the assembly of these protective layers would help stop bacteria forming plaque, the teams says.Another Practice That Helps Gut Disease: Yoga, Meditation and Prayer, Says StudyBenson-Henry Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital, May 19, 2022A pilot study has found that participating in a nine-week training program including elicitation of the relaxation response (mind body stress reduction techniques such as yoga, meditation and prayer) had a significant impact on clinical symptoms of the gastrointestinal disorders irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease and on the expression of genes related to inflammation and the body’s response to stress. 

- The study enrolled 48 adult participants – 19 of whom had been diagnosed with IBS and 29 diagnosed with IBD – who participated in a nine-week group program focused on stress reduction, cognitive skills and health-enhancing behaviors. 

- Along with aspects featured in other group programs offered at the Benson-Henry Institute, this program included a session specifically focused on gastrointestinal health.Both in patients with IBS and those with IBD, participation in the mind/body program appeared to have significantly improved disease-related symptoms, anxiety and overall quality of life, not only at the end of the study period but also three weeks later.

Could probiotics restore microbiome imbalance linked to autoimmune disorder?UCLA and Oslo UniversityProbiotics might help restore gut bacterial imbalance in patients with systemic sclerosis, says a new study looking at gastrointestinal bacterial compositions in two geographically-distinct populations suffering from the autoimmune disorder.Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease which impacts the body’s connective tissue. 

- “Most likely, this occurs through a combination of four major bioactivities, including anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, together with the appetite-suppressing activity.Scientists from the University of Malaya (Malaysia), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (Iran), and Natural Products Inc (USA) recruited 70 aerobically trained, overweight, and obese women to participate in their triple-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study. 

- In particular, people with strong friend connections were found to experience significantly better states of physical and mental health.“People with social support have fewer cardiovascular problems and immune problems, and lower levels of cortisol — a stress hormone,” says Tasha R. Howe, PhD, associate professor of psychology at Humboldt State University.Adding to the growing research on the benefits of friendship, a recent study conducted by researchers at Oxford University established that people with more friends have higher pain tolerance.The study was designed to use pain tolerance to test the brain’s endorphin activity.

Blueberries can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women with high blood pressureColorado State University, May 19 2022Consuming blueberries can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women with high blood pressure, according to new research by Colorado State University faculty member Sarah Ardanuy Johnson.Consumption of 22 grams of freeze dried blueberry powder (equivalent to about 1 cup of fresh blueberries) mixed with water taken daily for 12 weeks improved the function of the inner lining of blood vessels (called the endothelium), according to preliminary findings of a study.They performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm clinical trial in 43 estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women aged 45-65 years with elevated blood pressure or stage 1-hypertension. 

- Johnson’s research team used freeze-dried blueberries to retain the polyphenols as much as possible, and to allow for the study to be double-blind, meaning that neither the investigators nor the study participants knew whether they were getting the treatment (blueberry) or placebo.Johnson said the team observed increases in blood metabolites that are products of metabolism of anthocyanins (polyphenols found in blueberries that give them their blue color) and metabolism of polyphenols by the gut microbiome.Diet plays key role in ADHD symptoms in childrenOhio State University, May 20, 2022Here’s a good reason for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to eat their fruits and vegetables: It may help reduce inattention issues, a new study suggests.Results showed that kids who consumed more fruits and vegetables showed less severe symptoms of inattention, said Irene Hatsu, associate professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University.The study that evaluated the effectiveness of the supplement showed that children who took the micronutrients were three times as likely to show significant improvement in their ADHD and emotional dysregulation symptoms than those who took a placebo.Higher dose of melatonin improved sleep in older adultsHarvard University, May 19, 2022In a small study of healthy adults aged 55 and older, 5 mg of melatonin increased total sleep time compared to a placebo.Researchers conducted the study in 24 healthy, older adults to evaluate whether a high-doseor a low-dose melatonin supplement could improve sleep. 

- Researchers say this may not only be able to help treat obesity, but related diseases associated with excessive weight gain.”The beneficial effects of rutin on BAT-mediated metabolic improvement have evoked a substantial interest in the potential treatment for obesity and its related diseases, such as diabetes,” researcher Wan-Zhu Jin said in a press release. 

- Men and women who eat at least 10 grams of nuts or peanuts per day have a lower risk of dying from several major causes of death than people who don’t consume nuts or peanuts.The reduction in mortality was strongest for respiratory disease, neurodegenerative disease, and diabetes, followed by cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

Blueberry diet linked to lower breast cancer risk: New Zealand studyMassey University (New Zealand), May 10, 2022WELLINGTON (CIHAN)- Women might be able to reduce the risk of breast cancer by eating more blueberries, according to a New Zealand research.A Massey University study in which blueberries were fed to animals as part of their diet found they had a 50-percent lower incidence rate of mammary tumors.“Blueberries contain phytochemicals called anthocyanins, which may be responsible for the health benefits of blueberries,” Dr Janyawat Vuthijumnonk said in a statement.Tumours found in animals that received blueberries with fibre included (in pomace form), were smaller and less aggressive than in animals without blueberry consumption or in animals that received just blueberry juice.“We also found circulating estrogen – the steroid hormone which plays a key role in breast cancer promotion – was lower in animals that consumed the blueberry pomace supplemented diet,” said Vuthijumnonk.Study finds that yoga and meditation can help minimize cognitive impairmentUCLA, May 10, 2022Inner peace and a flexible body may not be the most valuable benefits that yoga and meditation have to offer, suggests new research by a UCLA-led team of neuroscientists.The team found that a three-month course of yoga and meditation practice helped minimize the cognitive and emotional problems that often precede Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia—and that it was even more effective than the memory enhancement exercises that have been considered the gold standard for managing mild cognitive impairment.“Memory training was comparable to yoga with meditation in terms of improving memory, but yoga provided a broader benefit than memory training because it also helped with mood, anxiety and coping skills,” said Helen Lavretsky, the study’s senior author.“Historically and anecdotally, yoga has been thought to be beneficial in aging well, but this is the scientific demonstration of that benefit,” said Harris Eyre, the study’s lead author. 

- In addition, past research has tied exercise-driven boosts in the dopamine-triggering chemical called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and in dopamine levels to improvements in learning and memory. 

- However, the precise way these three factors interact has until now remained unclear.Led by researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, the investigation showed that mice running on a wheel for 30 days had a 40% increase in dopamine release in the dorsal stratium, the part of the brain involved in movement, compared to levels in mice that did not exercise. 

- Additionally, when BDNF levels were artificially reduced, running did not lead to additional dopamine release.“Our findings suggest that BDNF plays a key role in the long-lasting changes that occur in the brain as a result of running,” says study lead author and neurobiologist Guendalina Bastioli, Ph.D. “Not only do these results help explain why exercise makes you move, think, and feel better, they also show that these benefits continue even if you do not work out every day,” adds Bastioli.High levels of exercise linked to nine years of less aging at the cellular levelBrigham Young University, May 10, 2022Despite their best efforts, no scientist has ever come close to stopping humans from aging.

Cocoa may enhance skeletal muscle functionUniversity of California at San Diego, May 3, 2022A small clinical trial led by researchers at UC San Diego School of Medicine and VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS) found that patients with advanced heart failure and type 2 diabetes showed improved mitochondrial structure after three months of treatment with epicatechin-enriched cocoa. 

- Biopsies of skeletal muscle were conducted before and after treatment. 

- After the three-month treatment, the researchers looked at changes in mitochondria volume and the abundance of cristae, which are internal compartments of mitochondria that are necessary for efficient function of the mitochondria, and measurable by electron microscopy.After three months, we saw recovery – cristae numbers back toward normal levels, and increases in several molecular indicators involved in new mitochondria production.”Healthy habits may improve longevity, prevent Alzheimer’s diseaseRush University Medical Center, May 14, 2022Everyday habits that serve as the backbone of a healthy lifestyle may keep your brain sharp and help you live longer, according to new research from aging experts at RUSH.A study recently published in the British Medical Journal found that people ages 65 and older who had a healthy lifestyle lived longer—3.1 years longer for women, 5.7 years longer for men—than their peers who didn’t have the same healthy lifestyle. 

- They also spent more of their remaining years without Alzheimer’s disease.What constitutes a healthy lifestyle?Eating the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurogenerative Delay (MIND) dietStaying engaged in cognitive activities like reading and puzzlesBeing physically active for at least 150 minutes a weekNot smokingLimiting alcohol use (no more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men)This latest study builds on ongoing research from RUSH showing that lifestyle factors can potentially reduce the risk for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia by up to 60%, says Kumar Rajan, Ph.D., professor of epidemiology and director of the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging.Ozone treated water v. lethal microbial materialUniversity of Alberta,  May 9, 2022A University of Alberta research team has discovered that technology commonly used to decontaminate food industry equipment can also rid meat processing plants of lethal microbial material responsible for the human version of the ailment Mad Cow disease.U of A microbiology professors Mike Belosevic and Norm Neumann and engineering professor Mohamed Gamal El-Din demonstrated that infectious proteins found in the brain matter of cattle can be eradicated from water treated with ozone.The discovery could have applications in decontaminating wastewater in settings such as slaughterhouse effluents where infected neural material known as prions may be present.The ozone decontamination procedure can potentially be used to sterilize instruments used for neurosurgery, and prevent the transfer of infectious prions during surgical procedures.Prions are able to destroy and can still be infectious after being incinerated at heats of 850o C. In the wild, soil contaminated by a carcass of a deer that died of Chronic Wasting Disease can remain a source of infection for many years.The U of A research team’s technique of using water treated with ozone to destroy prions is an improvement on current prion decontamination methods.Tai Chi Benefits Patients With Parkinson’sOregon Research Institute, May 13, 2022Tai chi, an ancient martial art characterized by slow, flowing movement and meditation, helps improve balance and movement control for people with Parkinson’s disease.The finding, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, is the latest study to show the benefits of tai chi for people with chronic health problems. 

- Past studies have shown that tai chi reduces falls and depression among the elderly, and lessens pain for patients with arthritis and fibromyalgia.In the latest research, 195 people with movement and balance problems caused by Parkinson’s disease were recruited from four Oregon cities. 

- The patients were divided into three exercise classes that met for an hour a day, twice a week. 

- Resistance training also offered some benefits, and both the tai chi and resistance training groups had fewer falls than the stretching group.Vitamin B12 shows promise against ALSTokushima University (Japan), May 13 2022.An article appearing on May 9, 2022 in JAMA Neurology described a randomized trial in which men and women with the progressive neurologic disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) exhibited improvement in their condition after receiving a high dose of a form of vitamin B12 known as methylcobalamin.Among the 126 patients who completed the trial, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale  scores declined by an average of 2.66 points for those who received the vitamin and by 4.63 in the placebo group—a difference of 43%. 

- )This randomized clinical trial demonstrated that use of ultrahigh-dose methylcobalamin resulted in a 43% reduction in clinical deterioration as evaluated with the ALSFRS-R total score throughout the 16-week treatment period in the patients with early-stage ALS,Diabetes risk from sitting aroundUniversity of Leicester (UK), May 12, 2022A new study has found that women who stay seated for long periods of time every day are more prone to developing type 2 diabetes, but that a similar link wasn’t found in men.Researchers from the University of Leicester Departments of Health Sciences and Cardiovascular Sciences revealed that women who are sedentary for most of the day were at a greater risk from exhibiting the early metabolic defects that act as a precursor to developing type 2 diabetes than people who tend to sit less.The team assessed over 500 men and women of the age of 40 or more about the amount of time spent sitting over the course of a week. 

- It was found that the women who spent the longest time sitting had higher levels of insulin, as well as higher amounts of C-reactive protein and chemicals released by fatty tissue in the abdomen, leptin, and interleukin6, and which indicate problematic inflammation.This study provides important new evidence that higher levels of sitting time have a deleterious impact on insulin resistance and chronic low-grade inflammation in women but not men and that this effect is seen regardless of how much exercise is undertaken. 

- This suggests that women who meet the national recommendations of 30 minutes of exercise a day may still be compromising their health if they are seated for the rest of the day.Videos:1.

- At the study’s conclusion, children who received B complex exhibited improvement in blood markers of glucose regulation and kidney function.“After 12 weeks of vitamin B complex supplementation in children and adolescents with diabetic kidney disease, we detected lower levels of markers that indicate poor kidney function, suggesting that it had a protective effect and could slow progression of the disease,” Dr Elbarbary reported.Zinc is cancer’s worst enemy: This mineral is key to preventing cancer, scientists concludeUniversity of Texas Arlington, May 12, 2022Consuming zinc might be something that you only think about when cold season approaches given its stellar performance in keeping the common cold at bay, but its value extends far beyond preventing this relatively innocuous problem to something far more serious: fighting cancer.Researchers from the University of Texas at Arlington have discovered the important role zinc can play in preventing cancer, especially the esophageal variety. 

- The researchers say their finding could help improve treatment for esophageal cancer and even provide some insight into how it might be prevented. 

- Pan pointed out that many cancer patients have a zinc deficiency.Dad’s involvement with baby early on associated with boost in mental developmentImperial College London, King’s College London and Oxford University, May 9, 2022 Fathers who interact more with their children in their first few months of life could have a positive impact on their baby’s cognitive development.In a study, published in the Infant Mental Health Journal, researchers from Imperial College London, King’s College London and Oxford University looked at how fathers interacted with their babies at three months of age and measured the infants’ cognitive development more than a year later.They found that babies whose fathers were more engaged and active when playing with them in their initial months performed better in cognitive tests at two years of age. 

- The findings were recently published in the journal Nutrients.Krikorian said his team has been conducting research on the benefits of berries for people with greater risk for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia for several years.The researchers enrolled 33 patients from around the Cincinnati area between the ages of 50-65 who were overweight, prediabetic and had noticed mild memory decline with aging. 

- Oxidative stress can lead to symptoms like fatigue and memory loss.Regular exercise with dietary advice linked to better mobility in frail older peopleYale University, May 11, 2022A program of regular exercise along with expert dietary advice is linked to a reduction in mobility problems among frail older people living in the community, finds a trial published by The BMJ today.The combination of aerobic (walking), strength, flexibility, and balance exercises alongside personalized nutritional counseling reduced mobility disability by 22% over three years.Their findings are based on 1,519 men and women (average age 79 years) with physical frailty and sarcopenia (a combination of reduced physical function and low muscle mass) recruited from 16 clinical sites across 11 European countries between 2016 and 2019.Women in the intervention group lost less muscle strength (0.9 kg at 24 months) and less muscle mass (0.24 kg and 0.49 kg at 24 months and 36 months, respectively) than control women, but no significant group differences were seen in men.Study: Side effects emerge after approval for many USYale University, May 9, 2022Almost one-third of new drugs approved by U.S. regulators over a decade ended up years later with warnings about unexpected, sometimes life-threatening side effects or complications, a newanalysis found.

- Laurie Goodyear, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, has found that a grandmother’s exercise during pregnancy may make her grandchildren healthier metabolically, with less body fat, better insulin control and, in some, healthier bones.We are looking for epigenetic alterations in the DNA, because epigenetic alterations can be changed as rapidly as two generations. 

- We are currently investigating how mothers’ exercise affects their children’s gametes.I’m confident in saying that women who are pregnant should try to be as physically active as they can, depending, of course, on the condition of their pregnancy. 

- There’s strong human data showing that exercise during pregnancy improves the mother’s health; numerous animal studies showing improved first-generation health; and now we have evidence that maternal exercise will positively impact the health of the second generation. 

- I’m not an obstetrician, and there are certainly conditions where a woman cannot perform exercise during pregnancy, but, when medically approved, being physically active is important—for the mother, the first generation, and now even the grandchildren.New Study Finds Simply Believing You Can Do Something To Improve It Is Linked With Higher WellbeingUniversity Of Southern Denmark And University Of Copenhagen, May 11, 2022The number of people struggling with poor mental health and mental disorders has been rising around the world over the past few decades. 

- Those who are struggling are increasingly facing difficulties accessing the kind of support they need – leaving many waiting months for help, if they even qualify for treatment.In our recent study, we asked 3,015 Danish adults to fill out a survey that asked questions about mental health – such as whether they believe they can do something to keep mentally healthy, whether they had done something in the past two weeks to support their mental health, and also whether they were currently struggling with a mental health problem. 

- We then assessed their level of mental wellbeing using the Short Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, which is widely used by healthcare professionals and researchers to measure mental wellbeing.As you’d expect, we found that mental wellbeing was highest among those who had done things to improve their mental health compared with the other participants.Interestingly, however, we found that – whether or not our respondents had actually taken action to improve their mental wellbeing – people who believed they could do something to keep mentally healthy tended to have higher mental wellbeing than those who didn’t have this belief.So while it’s most beneficial to take steps to improve your mental health, even just believing that you can improve it is associated with better overall mental wellbeing.The effect of night shifts—gene expression fails to adapt to new sleep patternsMcGill University (Quebec). 

- May 7, 2022Have you ever considered that working night shifts may, in the long run, have an impact on your health?

- However, this bioavailability study, published in the journal Nutrition, was the first clinical trial to show that extract of amaranthus - one of the sources of nitrite in nature - can help athletes work out longer and harder. 

- The researchers found that a single (2g) dose of amaranth extract was able to increase nitrate (NO3) and nitrite (NO2) levels in the body for at least eight hours.Until now, sports nutrition manufacturers have typically incorporated beetroot powder and juice into formulations in order to support nitrate levels. 

- These findings give this market a new, more potent form of nitrate to work with, according to botanical extracts manufacturer Arjuna, whose interest in amaranthus stems from its traditional use in Indian medicine and cooking.By comparison, he said that amaranthus was a far more “potent” form of nitrate for sports nutrition applications.“It’s standardised to 9-10% nitrate content, whereas most beet-based ingredients contain less than 2% nitrate,” he told NutraIngredients.Arjuna attributes this to its patent production process, which extracts 9,000mg per 100g of nitrate from the leaves of the amaranthus species.Another advantage over its beet-based counterparts is that it doesn’t contain any reducing sugars and oxalates.Study identifies exact amounts of extra vitamin C for optimal immune healthUniversity of Otago (New Zealand), May 6, 2022If you are carrying a few extra kilos in weight, an extra apple or two per day might make a difference in boosting your immune system and helping ward off COVID-19 and winter illnesses.New University of Otago  research has identified, for the first time, exactly how much extra vitamin C humans need to ingest, relative to their body weight, to maximize their immune health.The study has found that for every 10 kilograms of excess weight a person carries, their body needs an extra 10 milligrams of Vitamin C daily, which will help to optimize their immune health.

- Patients can experience nausea, difficulty breathing and dizziness at the thought of going to the dentist, during an examination, and following treatment.In a review of six trials with 800 patients, researchers used a points scale to measure anxiety and studies show that anxiety reduced by eight points when dental patients were given acupuncture as a treatment. 

- This level of reduction is considered to be clinically relevant, which means that acupuncture could be a possibility for tackling dental anxiety.Studies that compared anxiety levels between patients that received acupuncture and those that did not, showed a significant difference in anxiety scores during dental treatment. 

- During the last two months of the trial, the subjects participated in four health examinations that included blood pressure assessment and measurement of blood markers of inflammation, coagulation, endothelial function, oxidative stress, antioxidant activity, cardiometabolism and neuroendocrine stress response.Campus levels of fine particulate matter air pollution (PM 2.5) measured during the course of the trial averaged 38 micrograms per cubic meter. 

- The data generated will help identify people at high risk of developing sleep apnea and to find novel treatment strategies.Researchers in Umeå have shown that snorers and sleep apnea patients have neuromuscular injuries in the upper respiratory tract. 

- Sleep apnea is characterized by repeated collapse of the upper respiratory tract leading to respiratory arrest during sleep, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.The studies show that people who constantly snore heavily and have sleep apnea displayed a loss of nerves and muscle mass in the soft palate. 

- It becomes a vicious circle where snoring causes damage and at the same time disturb healing of injuries, which can lead to swallowing dysfunction and sleep apnea.Study: Tai chi can reduce hypertension symptoms in young and middle-aged in-service staffZhei-jian Hospital (China)Researchers from Zhejiang Hospital in China reported that practicing t’ai chi can help with hypertension.The treatment group practiced simplified t’ai chi for three months.

- In particular, exercise altered amino acid metabolism in adipose tissue. 

- The study was published in Scientific Reports.Exercise had a beneficial effect on fasting glucose concentrations, waist circumference, maximum oxygen consumption rate, and maximum achieved workload. 

- These factors were also associated with many of the observed alterations in the abundance of various metabolites in the exercise intervention group. 

- The most significant alterations were observed in amino acids and their derivatives, lipids, and bile acids.In particular, exercise increased the levels of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins, in adipose tissue. 

- According to the researchers, their higher accumulations in adipose tissue may be associated with improved lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as with reduced insulin resistance.The levels of various gut microbial metabolites were altered as a result of exercise, which is suggestive of changes in the composition of gut microbes, or in their function. 

- Inadequate vitamin intake linked with insulin resistanceUniversity of Alabama, May 2 2022.A greater risk of insulin resistance was revealed among women with acceptable calorie consumption whose folate and vitamin C intake were below the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) values in a study reported  in Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases. 

- Among women whose calorie intake was categorized as acceptable and who met the Food and Nutrition Board’s DRI of folate and vitamin C, the respective risks of insulin resistance were 59% and 66% lower than women who did not meet the DRIs. 

- The study also showed that even with the consumption of over the recommended calorie intake, only 2% of women met the DRI of vitamin D and approximately only 30% met the DRIs of vitamins A and E, further emphasizing the fact that a significant proportion of women consume calorie-dense food rather than micronutrient-dense food.”(NEXT)Ingesting soy protein may ease severity of inflammatory bowel diseasePenn State University, April 26, 2022A diet supplemented with soy protein may be an effective adjunct therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases, Penn State researchers reported after completing a study that included mice and cultured human colon cells.

- "Lipid and glucose levels at age 35 associated with Alzheimer's diseaseBoston University School of Medicine, March 23, 2022Living your best life at 35, ignoring cholesterol and glucose levels, may impact your chances of getting Alzheimer's disease (AD) later in life. 

- "While our findings confirm other studies that linked cholesterol and glucose levelsmeasured in blood with future risk of Alzheimer's disease, we have shown for the first time that these associations extend much earlier in life than previously thought," explains senior author Lindsay A. Farrer, Ph.D., chief of biomedical genetics at BUSM.The researchers found that lower HDL (the good cholesterol) is predictive of AD in early (35-50 years) and middle (51-60 years) adulthood and that high glucose in the blood (a precursor of diabetes) during mid-adulthood is also predictive of AD "These findings show for the first time that cardiovascular risk factors, including HDL which has not been consistently reported as a strong risk factor for AD, contribute to future risk of AD starting as early as age 35," says first and corresponding author Xiaoling Zhang, MD, Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine at BUSM.Exercise holds even more heart health benefits for people with stress-related conditionsMassachusetts General Hospital, March 24, 2022Regular physical activity had nearly doubled the cardiovascular benefit in individuals with depression or anxiety, compared with individuals without these diagnoses, according to a study presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 71st Annual Scientific Session.The research findings add to mounting evidence that exercise improves cardiovascular health by helping to activate parts of the brain that counteract stress. 

- These benefits were significantly greater in those with anxiety or depression, who had a 22% risk reduction vs. a 10% risk reduction in those without either condition.For the study, researchers analyzed health records of more than 50,000 patients in the Massachusetts General Brigham Biobank database.

- “It is increasingly recognized that getting enough sleep, particularly high-quality sleep, is important for health including cardiovascular health. 

- Unfortunately, more than a third of Americans don’t get enough sleep on a regular basis,” said study author Angelique Brellenthin, Ph.D.,  “Aerobic activity is often recommended to improve sleep, yet very little is known about the effects of resistance exercise versus aerobic exercise on sleep. 

- Participants were randomly assigned to a no-exercise group (for comparison) or one of three exercise groups (aerobic only, resistance only, or combined aerobic and resistance) for 12 months. 

- Everyone in the exercise groups participated in supervised 60-minute sessions, three times a week, with the combination exercise group doing 30 minutes of aerobic and 30 minutes of resistance exercise. 

- They point out that numerous studies have focused on identifying the association between inadequate concentrations of vitamins A, D, and E and the incidence of RRTIs in Chinese children, but that the results have been contentious. 

- They found that serum levels of vitamins A and E were significantly lower in the RRTI group than the control group. 

- “The conditional logistic regression model and the receiver-operating characteristic curve showed that the insufficiency or deficiency of vitamins A, D, and E was positively correlated with RRTI occurrence (p < 0.05),” they added. 

- “The incidence of insufficiency or deficiency for vitamins A, E, and D was 24.33%, 8.17%, and 19.33% in the control group but increased to 63.00%, 33.83%, and 56.50% in the RRTI group, respectively.” The researchers believe the study demonstrated that lower serum levels of vitamins A, D, and E are associated with RRTIs.

- (See conclusion of study)20 mins of daily exercise at 70 may best stave off major heart disease in late old ageAny physical activity is better late than never but earlier in older age, better stillUniversity of Padua (Italy), February 15, 2022Twenty minutes of daily moderate to vigorous exercise in early old age (70-75) may best stave off major heart disease, including heart failure, in late old age (80+), suggests research published online in the journal Heart.The findings reinforce the maxim of ‘better late than never,’ when it comes to exercise, but earlier on in older age is better still, concludes a linked editorial.To plug this knowledge gap, the researchers drew on data from the Progetto Veneto Anziani (ProVA), a study of 3099 older Italians (65 and above). 

- The final analysis included 2754 participants with complete data, of whom 1398 were women (60%).The largest reduction in risk was observed for new cases of coronary heart disease and heart failure in late old age. 

- Patterns of stable-high physical activity were associated with a significantly (52%) lower risk of cardiovascular disease among men compared with those with stable-low patterns.The greatest benefits seemed to occur at the age of 70. 

- Risk was only marginally lower at the age of 75, and no lower at the age of 80-85, suggesting that improving physical activity earlier in old age might have the most impact, say the researchers.Psilocybin treatment for major depression effective for up to a year for most patients, study showsJohns Hopkins University, February 15, 2022Previous studies by Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers showed that psychedelic treatment with psilocybin relieved major depressive disorder symptoms in adults for up to a month. 

- She cautions, however, that “the results we see are in a research setting and require quite a lot of preparation and structured support from trained clinicians and therapists, and people should not attempt to try it on their own.”The researchers reported that psilocybin treatment produced large decreases in depression, and that depression severity remained low one, three, six and 12 months after treatment.Prevent memory loss with a powerful nutrient in cucumbersSalk Institute for Biological Studies, February 15, 2022The results of a recent study are offering new hope that avoiding memory loss related to aging as well as Alzheimer’s disease could be as simple as eating more cucumbers.Many older adults resign themselves to memory loss as part of the aging process. 

- The health benefits of cucumbers are many, and one of them seems to be better memory and even the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease.Researchers working with mice that normally developed the symptoms of Alzheimer’s (including memory loss) discovered that a daily dose of a flavonol called fisetin prevented these and other related impairments. 

- The experimental findings suggest that this association may be due, at least in part, to increased anxiety.“This research reveals that air pollution may have potential ethical costs that go beyond its well-known toll on health and the environment,” says behavioral scientist Jackson G. Lu of Columbia Business School, the first author of the research. 

- This association held even after the researchers accounted for other potential factors, including total population, number of law enforcement employees, median age, gender distribution, race distribution, poverty rate, unemployment rate, unobserved heterogeneity among cities (e.g., city area, legal system), and unobserved time-varying effects (e.g., macroeconomic conditions).“Our findings suggest that air pollution not only corrupts people’s health, but also can contaminate their morality,” Lu concludes.(Videos)1.

- But if we use the exact same search using these symptoms, we can compare “apples to apples” in examining fetal deaths following COVID-19 vaccines as compared to fetal deaths following all non-COVID vaccines.Here are the yearly averages:82 fetal deaths per year following non-COVID vaccines3063 fetal deaths per year following COVID-19 vaccines
Alpha-lipoic acid supplementation associated with improved lipid levelsTabriz University of Medical Sciences (Iran), February 14 2022.Findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the International Journal for Vitamin and Nutrition Research indicated that supplementing with alpha-lipoic acid was associated with improvements in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides. 

- Researchers at Tabriz university of Medical Sciences in Iran selected 12 randomized, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the association between supplementing with alpha-lipoic acid and lipid levels among a total of 548 participants. 

- Dose-response analysis found a nonlinear relationship of LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels with alpha-lipoic acid dosage that was dependent upon the duration of treatment. 

- This protective effect was found for all participants, as well as among those carrying a gene that puts them at higher risk of developing dementia, a new study led by the Yale School of Public Health has found. 

- Published in the journal PLOS ONE, the study reports that older persons with positive age beliefs who carry one of the strongest risk factors for developing dementia—the ε4 variant of the APOE gene —were nearly 50% less likely to develop the disease than their peers who held negative age beliefs.

- Our patients met the diagnostic criteria for ASIA [autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants]; they were exposed to an adjuvant (vaccine), and they developed clinical manifestations of thyroid hyperfunction within a few days, with the appearance of antithyroid antibodies, despite being healthy before vaccination.”The scientists write, “In addition, the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine shares a genetic similarity with a large heptapeptide human protein, so this is an additional factor that can trigger autoimmune disease (AID) after vaccination due to molecular mimicry.”Antibodies from original strain COVID-19 infection don't bind to variantsUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignPeople infected with the original strain of the virus that causes COVID-19 early in the pandemic produced a consistent antibody response, making two main groups of antibodies to bind to the spike protein on the virus's outer surface.

- Based upon the evidence and my repeated encounters with the Wikimedia Foundation’s in-house and outside attorneys it is my belief that the encyclopedia’s efforts to advance a globalist and corporate-friendly ideology may be intentional.It is not merely the hundreds of thousands of physicians worldwide who rely on peer-reviewed supported therapies, but Wikipedia’s animus has spread far and wide to assure that its users have no objective choice over sound information about personal religious, socio-political or health decisions. 

- (NEXT)More lycopene linked to longer lives for people with metabolic syndromeUniversity of Nebraska Medical Center, January 16, 2022Higher blood levels of lycopene may reduce the risk of mortality in people with metabolic syndrome, says a new study from the University of Nebraska Medical Center. 

- New data published in Nutrition Research suggests that higher serum levels of lycopene were associated with greater survival times for people with metabolic syndrome, compared to low serum levels. 

- Multiple sclerosis, which affects one in every 1,000 people in Spain, is a serious autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of some types of neurons, causing progressive neurological disability. 

- The relationship between cardiovascular disease and so-called "fragmented" sleep has been studied in the past, but this is the first study to look specifically for an association between sleep fragmentation and detailed microscopic measures of blood vessel damage and infarcts in autopsied brain tissue from the same individuals. 

- According to investigative research done by independent-journalist Sam Husseini and The Intercept, much of the money awarded to EcoHealth Alliance did not focus on health or ecology, but rather on biowarfare, bioterrorism, and other dangerous uses of deadly pathogens. 

- Dr. Andrew Huff received his Ph.D. in Environmental Health specializing in emerging diseases before becoming an Associate Vice President at EcoHealth Alliance, where he developed novel methods of bio-surveillance, data analytics, and visualization for disease detection. 

- However, as we have reported for the past several years, the telecomm giants, notably AT&T and Verizon, and its leading media spokespersons at CNN and the New York Times, have undermined and denied 5G’s risks, especially to human health and the environment, ever since wireless technologies were first commercialized.5G is destined to be a permanent fixture across the nation. 

- The thousands of medical and environmental studies confirming high EMF’s dangers and the petitions signed by thousands of international scientists to halt its deployment are unequivocally ignored or worse ostracized and canceled. 

- Between August 2016 and September 2018 alone, over 400 new studies on electromagnetic radiation risks were compiled by public health Professor Joel Moskowitz at the University of California at Berkeley.Despite the pandemic, lockdowns and social distancing have not hindered 5G’s progress to connect every American into its spider’s web. 

- The World Economic Forum’s presentation, “Why is 5G Important for the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” outlines the multi-trillion dollar impact advanced connectivity will have on manufacturing, wholesale and resale, smart cities and homes, public services, transportation, real time banking, finance and insurance, agriculture and forestry, micro chip surveillance, real estate, education, mining, health and medicine.We must not hold any false hopes that the Biden administration will ultimately side with the airlines’ safety concerns. 

- This outline was presented by Dr. Martin Pall, a Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Medical Sciences at Washington State University to the National Institutes of Health. 

- These can cause cancer and mutations in the sexual germ lines.Apoptosis:  EMFs contribute to programmed cell death that in turn leads to reproductive and neurodegenerative disorders.Oxidative Stress:  Free radical damage that has been associated with numerous health conditions including cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic inflammation, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, cellular death and agingEndocrine Effects: According Dr. Pall, every hormonal system in the body is adversely affected by EMF exposure.Excessive Intracellular Calcium:  Ca2+ is critical for cellular activityCancer:  There are 35 separate scientific reviews of the body of peer-reviewed literature providing evidence that EMFs increase carcinogenesis, promote and progress tumor development and contribute to metastasis.There are also other medical conditions that have been shown to be associated likely with EMF exposure:Cardiac Effects. 

- There is a growing consensus in the scientific and medical community that 5G will usher an epidemic of disease never before witnessed in human history. 

- Nevertheless, if the past and current research on EMF's adverse effects on health and the environment during the past 50 years are any indication, we are entering a new epoch of disease and neurological disorders that humanity is completely unprepared to handle.This is a consequence of what happens when an entire nation is trapped into carelessly trusting elected presidents and legislators whose campaigns are bankrolled by the Telecomm giants and Silicon Valley, and a media empire ruled by serial liars and masters of disinformation campaigns for private corporate interests. 

- HEALTH NEWSWalking for 150 minutes per week associated with improved wellbeing in over-50Trinity College Dublin, January 17, 2022New research using data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) at Trinity College Dublin shows that being physically active, for example by walking for at least 150 minutes per week, is associated with more social participation and better mental health and wellbeing.The findings show that:Two-thirds of the Irish population aged 50 years and older report low or moderate levels of physical activity while only one-third report high levels of activity, based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.Middle-aged and older Irish adults with high levels of physical activity report greater participation in social activities, less anxiety, better quality of life, and less loneliness compared to those with low physical activity levels.Middle-aged and older adults with low levels of physical activity are over twice as likely to have clinically relevant depressive symptoms as those with high levels of physical activity (14% versus 6%).Interventions should specifically target women, older adults, those in employment, those who are not engaged in non-church related social activities and those living in built-up areas such as apartments.Study finds hydroxychloroquine delays disability for least treatable form of multiple sclerosisUniversity of Calgary (Canada), January 17, 2022A University of Calgary study has found promising results for the generic drug hydroxychloroquine when used to treat the evolution of disability of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), the least treatable form of the autoimmune disease.Cumming School of Medicine research teams found hydroxychloroquine helped to slow the worsening of disability during the 18-month study involving participants at the MS clinic in Calgary. 

- Tree nut consumption was associated with better nutrient adequacy for most nutrients that are lacking in the diets of many Americans, and with better diet quality.Researchers looked at 14,386 adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES).

- In this way, the most controversial issues of our day—race, religion, sex, sexuality, politics, science, health, government corruption, police brutality, etc.—have become battlegrounds for those who claim to believe in freedom of speech but only when it favors the views and positions they support.This tendency to censor, silence, delete, label as “hateful,” and demonize viewpoints that run counter to the cultural elite is being embraced with a near-fanatical zealotry by a cult-like establishment that values conformity and group-think over individuality.This authoritarian intolerance masquerading as tolerance, civility and love (what comedian George Carlin referred to as “fascism pretending to be manners”) is the end result of a politically correct culture that has become radicalized, institutionalized and tyrannical.J.K.

- "There Is Currently No COVID Medical Emergency Only Psychological Engineering Says Senior Israeli ImmunologistGREAT GAME INDIA,  January 16, 2022The attempts of governments across the globe at “psychological engineering” the population on Covid related matters has now been fully exposed after several years. 

- A well respected immunologist in Israel heavily criticized the approach of every administration globally.In a scathing letter addressed to the Israeli Ministry of Health, a renowned immunologist denounced mass vaccination against COVID-19 and chastised officials who’ve already “branded” the unvaccinated “as spreaders of the disease.”The letter, penned by Professor Ehud Qimron, who is the head of Tel Aviv University’s Department of Microbiology and Immunology, rips off vaccine-focused COVID tactics endorsed by authorities across the globe, which Qimron labels “doomed to fail.”“Two years late, you finally realize that a respiratory virus cannot be defeated and that any such attempt is doomed to fail,” he wrote to the Israeli health ministry. 

- According to a study released last month by British researchers, the jabs dramatically raise the chance of potentially life-threatening heart inflammation in males under 40 years old compared to COVID-19 and may lead in more lethal types of the heart ailment.“You have ignored many reports of changes in menstrual intensity and menstrual cycle times,” Qimron noted in his letter to the health ministry. 

- You have harmed livelihoods, the economy, human rights, mental health and physical health.”You slandered colleagues who did not surrender to you, you turned the people against each other, divided society and polarized the discourse. 

- You branded, without any scientific basis, people who chose not to get vaccinated as enemies of the public and as spreaders of disease. 

- You promote, in an unprecedented way, a draconian policy of discrimination, denial of rights and selection of people, including children, for their medical choice. 

- A selection that lacks any epidemiological justification.“There is currently no medical emergency,” the immunologist continued. 

- “The only emergency now is that you still set policies and hold huge budgets for propaganda and psychological engineering instead of directing them to strengthen the health care system.”“This emergency must stop!”Serious Health Risks of Covid-19 Vaccines: Open Letter to Cornell University Board of Trustees and President Martha PollackCornell University Community, January 12, 2022Dear President Pollack and Cornell Board of Trustees,We are students, parents, alumni, faculty, and staff of Cornell University. 

- But as with any public health policy, many factors — scientific, ethical, and legal — must be considered and weighed. 

- This decision is counter to science and seems like it was made less to promote students’ health and more to achieve some other unstated goal of the administration. 

- Please do the right thing, and end this unnecessary and unethical mandate.EU Regulators, WHO Call for End to COVID Boosters, Citing Evidence Strategy Is FailingEU drug regulators, World Health Organization experts and the former chairman of the UK’s COVID task force all cited mounting evidence mRNA COVID boosters aren’t working and the strategy should be dropped.Childrens Health Defense, January 12, 2022European Union drug regulators warned frequent COVID boosters could adversely affect the immune system and said there are currently no data to support repeated doses.According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), continued booster doses every four months could pose a risk of overloading people’s immune systems and lead to fatigue.Instead, the agency recommended countries space out the intervals between boosters and coordinate their programs with the onset of the cold season in each hemisphere — following blueprints of influenza vaccination strategies.Boosters “can be done once, or maybe twice, but it’s not something that we can think should be repeated constantly,” Cavaleri said. 

- “We need to think about how we can transition from the current pandemic setting to a more endemic setting.”The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) on Jan. 11 warned, “a vaccination strategy based on repeated booster doses of the original vaccine composition is unlikely to be appropriate or sustainable.”The expert group, created by the WHO to assess the performance of COVID vaccines, said providing fresh doses of already existing vaccines as new strains of the virus emerge is not the best way to fight a pandemic.“It’s over, people,” Alex Berenson, former New York Times reporter and best-selling author, wrote. 

- That promise is as empty as all the others the health bureaucrats and vaccine companies have made.”60% Of Omicron Hospitalization Numbers Were Incorrect Admits Canada’s Chief Medical OfficerGREAT GAME INDIA. 

- The Premier of Alberta has claimed a staggering 60% disparity between the actual figures.Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and Alberta Chief Medical Officer Deena Hinshaw both confirmed that public figures for ICU capacity and COVID admissions were up to 60% incorrect.“Of the 163 omicron patients in hospital, 66 have a primary COVID diagnosis … and of the 14 omicron patients in ICU, 11 have a primary COVID diagnosis,” he stated.As per Kenney, this indicates that 60% of individuals labelled as staying in the hospital for an omicron ailment weren’t there because they arrived sick with COVID, and also that the ICU statistics reflect the same rationale, with more than 20% of recorded stays being unintentional.This is consistent with developments found throughout Canada, as provincial medical authorities have shifted their focus and begun to release increasingly specific data on hospitalizations. 

- The nation’s health or illness is not uniform. 

- In fact, it is only after people exercise their thoughts independently, with the certain belief that they have actual self-control over their lives, that they can arrive at the realization that their perceptions may be largely distorted. 

- At this moment the federal government and individual states are blindly over-reacting to Covid’s health threats, the climate and environment, and the collapse of social cohesion. 

- Any criticism towards the failures of the Covid-19 vaccines is redefined as threats to public health. 

- We may recall that under the second Bush administration, the justice department created “free speech zones,” fenced off or confined areas where demonstrators were only permitted to exercise their Constitutional rights of free protest and expression. 

- Finally, we need to awaken to modern technologies’ remarkable sophistication and its certain threats to the health of our societies, and even to our definition of being human. 

- The nation’s health or illness is not uniform. 

- In fact, it is only after people exercise their thoughts independently, with the certain belief that they have actual self-control over their lives, that they arrive at the realization that their perceptions may be largely distorted.Throughout America’s history there has been a system of three federal branches to assure there is a platform for checks and balances as well as a structure to contain the tensions between them. 

- Block chain has already been employed for almost a decade.At this moment the federal government and individual states are blindly over-reacting to Covid’s health threats, the climate and environment, and the collapse of social cohesion. 

- Any criticism towards the failures of the Covid-19 vaccines is redefined as threats to public health. 

- The new unstated law is that original investigation must support the official narrative, otherwise it will be prohibited from accessible public view.We may recall that under the second Bush administration, the justice department created “free speech zones,” fenced off or confined areas where demonstrators were only permitted to exercise their Constitutional rights of free protest and expression. 

- What has vanished in the US’ former full spectrum dominance over the geopolitical landscape is now being inverted to strengthen federal hegemonic reign over the American population.Finally, we need to awaken to modern technologies’ remarkable sophistication and its certain threats to the health of our societies, and even to our definition of being human. 

- Today, presidential campaigns and federal laws, public health policies, the mainstream media and corporate entertainment are the conduits for how we define ourselves. 

- We are sold on the promises of 5G technology despite the media never mentioning its serious dangers to human health and the environment. 

- Now that all world governments’ health policies have utterly failed to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as Delta and Omicron, more and more doctors and medical experts around the world are coming forth to say we have been deceptively misled by the Ministry of Truth’s Anthony Fauci-s and Bill Gates-s of the world. 

- Those with cancer, heart disease, diabetes and dementia are told to just hang on a bit longer; a blockbuster pharmaceutical cure is just around the corner. 

- However this is not an exercise in reason, but a direct experience within the depths of ourselves. 

- Van Breemen and collaborators, including scientists at Oregon Health & Science University, found that a pair of cannabinoid acids bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking a critical step in the process the virus uses to infect people. 

- A drug target is any molecule critical to the process a disease follows, meaning its disruption can thwart infection or disease progression.Tomato concentrate could help reduce chronic intestinal inflammation associated with HIVUniversity of California Los Angeles, January 11, 2021 New UCLA-led research in mice suggests that adding a certain type of tomato concentrate to the diet can reduce the intestinal inflammation that is associated with HIV. 

- Left untreated, intestinal inflammation can accelerate arterial disease, which in turn can lead to heart attack and stroke. 

- The findings provide clues to how the altered intestinal tract affects disease-causing inflammation in people with chronic HIV infection, suggesting that targeting the inflamed intestinal wall may be a novel way to prevent the systemic inflammation that persists even when antiviral therapy is effective in controlling a person's HIV.Too much sitting could mean worse outcomes for cancer survivorsCancer Care Alberta (Canada), January 11, 2022 A new study shows those who sit too much and are not physically active are much more likely to die early from cancer or any other cause than those who are more active. 

- Data on cancer survivors who took part in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2014 showed that inactive survivors who reported sitting more than eight hours a day were at the highest risk of dying. 

- The link was particularly troubling because the researchers found that as many as one-third of cancer survivors didn't exercise and sat more than six hours a day. 

- Only about one-third got the recommended 150 hours of exercise a week, Yang said.Running could improve brain function in people with Gulf War illnessTexas A&M University, January 10, 2022 It has now been three decades since 700,000 American troops responded to the invasion of Kuwait in the first Gulf War, and more than a third of those troops still suffer from the same condition: Gulf War Illness (GWI). 

- Earlier phase 1 trials indicated this treatment is safe and well-tolerated and hinted that the therapy improves patient outcomes. 

- The current, larger trials aim to determine if the treatment improves survival. 

- In a new study, published recently in the December issue of the journal Redox Biology, Buettner and his colleagues have homed in on the biological details of how high-dose vitamin C (also known as ascorbate) kills cancer cells.People with early-onset Parkinson's disease may benefit from boosting niacin in dietUniversity of Leicester (UK), January 10, 2022 •    Team studied fruit flies with a mutation that mimics the human disease •    Niacin/Vitamin B3 is found in a variety of foods including meats and nuts •    Research suggests niacin boosts levels of NAD compound in body for energy generation and DNA repair, which is critical for keeping mitochondria in shape and Parkinson's at bay •    Drugs that block NAD-consuming DNA repair already exist to treat cancer - therefore these drugs could be repurposed to protect faulty mitochondria in Parkinson's disease "This study strengthens the therapeutic potential for Vitamin B3/niacin-based dietary interventions in the treatment of Parkinson's disease" - Dr Miguel Martins, MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester People with certain forms of early-onset Parkinson's disease may benefit from boosting the amount of niacin in their diet, according to new research from the University of Leicester. 

- The team from the MRC Toxicology Unit at the University of Leicester studied fruit flies with a mutation that mimics the human disease.America’s Crisis of Cultural Moral PanicRichard Gale and Gary Null PhD Progressive Radio Network, January 12, 2022 It is one thing to show a man that he is in error and another to put him in touch with truth… No man’s knowledge can go beyond his experience” – John Locke (Essays Concerning Human Understanding) Locke was not alone in questioning what we believe to be true knowledge, and pointing out the consequences of failing to discern falsehoods from reality. 

- Although the medical community would like us to believe these are either inherited or biological conditions attributable to brain chemical imbalances, there is absolutely no scientific consensus proving there is a direct, observable causal relationship between brain function and mental states. 

- It also centers aroundthose who society marginalizes and is based upon “ethnicity, class, sexuality, nationality and religion.” Ashley Grossman, writing for ThoughtCo, makes the point that those in power will ultimately most benefit from moral panics “since they lead to increased control of the population and the reinforcement of the authority of those in charge.” The panic aroused grassroots movements provides the government or state “to enact legislation and laws that would seem illegitimate without the perceived threat at the center of the moral panic.” The popular fear of the Covid-19 virus and the unvaccinated created by our federal health officials and their news media allies is another recent example of Moral Panic Theory. 

- It’s the unvaccinated who are going to be hurt, so why should anyone who is boosted bother at this point to do anything that makes the unvaccinated more safe?” CNN’s John Berman asked Professor Arthur Caplan, the director of the medical ethics division at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. 

- You can’t get life insurance, disability insurance at affordable rates if you aren’t vaccinated.”NO DEATHS FROM VITAMINS - Safety Confirmed by America's Largest DatabaseOrthomolecular News Service, January 7th 2022 The 38th annual report from the American Association of Poison Control Centers shows zero deaths from vitamins. 

- The AAPCC reports zero deaths from multiple vitamins. 

- The health ministry reported 17,518 new infections on Saturday. 

- Health ministry data showed that more than 4.3 million Israelis were fully vaccinated with three shots, while 204 people are hospitalised in serious condition as a result of Covid-19 illness on Sunday. 

- Childrens Health Defense, January 7, 2022 COVID-19 booster shots could do more harm than good, according to scientists interviewed late last month by The New York Times. 

- A new report from the UK Health Security Agency showed booster doses are less effective against Omicron than previous variants, and their effectiveness wears off in only 10 weeks. 

- Professor Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist and chairman of Israel’s Association of Public Health Physicians, told The New York Times there’s no published scientific evidence a fourth shot is needed to prevent severe illness from Omicron. 

- From the study: “Results indicate that the treatment (vaccine administration) has a strong and statistically significant propensity to causally increase the values in either y1 [variable chosen for deaths per million] or y2 [variable chosen for cases per million] over and above what would have been expected with no treatment. 

- y1 showed an increase/decrease ratio of (+115/-13), which means 89.84% of statistically significant countries showed an increase in total deaths per million associated with COVID-19 due directly to the causal impact of treatment initiation [vaccines]. 

- y2 showed an increase/decrease ratio of (+105/-16) which means 86.78% of statistically significant countries showed an increase in total cases per millionof COVID-19 due directly to the causal impact of treatment initiation.” Perhaps the most telling part of the study’s results is that the countries which recorded the fewest Covid deaths in 2020 were the ones to experience the largest increases in cases and deaths once the vaccine was introduced, with some of them seeing increases as high as over a thousand percent. 

- Approximately 1% of parents reported seeking medical care in the week after vaccination"~ "Two reports of death during the analytic period [November 3 - December 19, 2021]
The Government Assault Against Ivermectin and other Safe SARS-2 TreatmentsRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, September 1, 2021Had the FDA and Anthony Fauci’s National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease (NIAID) started approving existing clinically-proven and inexpensive drugs for treating malaria, parasites and other pathogens at the start of the pandemic, millions of people would have been saved from experiencing serious infections or dying from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 

- Why federal health officials never followed this strategy is a question the mainstream media refuses to ask.Another question that the medical establishment, let alone our compliant media, is why have they failed to ask whether there are reliable studies in the peer-reviewed literature and testimonies from thousands of day-to-day clinical physicians worldwide who treat Covid-19 patients with these drugs, in particular hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Ivermectin. 

- However, in the US, Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, the FDA and our federal medical officials have categorically denied their use. 

- It may be noted that various organizations and agencies in other nations, such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority in South Africa, which have banned ivermectin, are often funded by Gates. 

- It is naïve to believe that Gates has any philanthropic intentions whatsoever to see a highly effective treatment for SARS-2 infections reach worldwide approval. 

- Remdesivir’s average effectiveness for late stage treatment is only 22 percent. 

- A Chinese study published in The Lancet found no statistically significant benefit in the drug and 12 percent of participants taking the drug had to discontinue treatment due to serious adverse effects, especially liver and kidney damage.When questions are posited as a general argument for advocating expedient measures to protect public health during this pandemic, would it not have been wise to have prioritized for emergency use HCQ, Ivermectin, and other remedies with a record of curtailing Covid, such as the antibiotic azithromycin, zinc, selenium, Vitamins C and D, and melatonin as a first line of defense? 

- But this is what Fauci and Trump, and now Biden, permitted to happen.If this strategy of medical intervention had been followed, would it have been successful? 

- Yet those American physicians struggling to get this urgent message out to federal health officials are being marginalized and ridiculed en masse. 

- The World Health Organization recommends Ivermectin for Covid-19 so why not the US and these other nations? 

- Under oath, multiple physicians and professors at American medical schools have testified before Congress to present the scientific evidence supporting HCQ and Ivermectin. 

- These are otherwise medical professionals at the very heart of treating Covid-19 patients.Today, American journalism is in shambles. 

- Whether it is CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the liberal tabloid Daily Beast, NPR or PBS, each has unlimited resources to properly investigate the federal and institutional machinery behind the government health policies being thrust upon us. 

- Yet no mainstream journalist has found the moral compass to bring this truth to the public.In the meantime, we are allowing millions to die, and countless others to be seriously affected from a severe infection because of professional medical neglect and a healthcare system favoring the pharmaceutical industry’s frantic rush to develop expensive novel drugs and experimental vaccines. 

- Worldwide, it is not unreasonable to claim that billions of people have been treated with these drugs.Below is a breakdown of the studies conducted so far for HCQ, Ivermectin and Vitamin D specifically for combatting the SARS-CoV-2 virusHydroxychloroquine344 studies, 250 peer-reviewed have been conducted specifically for Covid-19281 have been clinical trials that involved 4,583 scientists and over 407,627 patients64% improvement in 31 early treatment trials75% improvement in 13 early stage infection treatment mortality results21% improvement in 190 late stage infection treatment trials (patients in serious condition)23% improvement in 44 randomized controlled trialsFull list of HCQ studies and details:  https://c19hcq.comIvermectin131 studies, 52 peer-reviewed have been conducted specifically for Covid-1963 have been clinical trials that involved 613 scientists and over 26,398 patients58% improvement in 31 randomized controlled trials86% improvement in 14 prophylaxis trials72% improvement in 27 early stage infection treatment trials40% improvement in 22 late stage infection treatment trials58% improvement in 25 mortality resultsFull list of Ivermectin studies and details:  https://c19ivermectin.comOther inexpensive repurposed drugs for treating SARS-2Fluvoxamine88% improvement in early treatment29% improvement in late stage treatment63% improvement in all 7 peer-reviewed studiesVitamin D101 studies conducted by over 875 scientists63 sufficiency studies with 34,863 patients33 treatment trials with 46,860 patients42% improvement in 33 treatment trials56% improvement in 68 sufficiency studies55% improvement in 19 treatment mortality resultsFull list of Vitamin D studies and details:  https://c19vitamind.comIn contrast there have been 21 studies enrolling 35,744 patients in Remdesivir trials showing only a 22% improvement in all studies combined.

Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi is an American born physician trained in Germany and has been in the medical field now for five decades. 

- He received his medical degree from the University of Bonn and did his post-doctoral work at the prestigious Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics before becoming an associate professor at the Institute of Medical Microbiology at Gressen University. 

- Later he was appointed as the chair of Medical Microbiology at the University of Mainz. 

- Adiponectin increased by 5% and 6% in the 25 g and 50 g FDSP groups, respectively, while it declined in the placebo-control group by 25% (P = 0.03 for time-by-treatment interaction). 

- Published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, the findings reveal a need for health care professionals to provide advice and clarity to patients about the appropriate use of dietary supplements.To explore factors associated with dietary supplement use in cancer survivors, Rana Conway, PhD, RNutr, of University College London (UCL), and her colleagues studied 1,049 adults who had been diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer in the United Kingdom.Among the major findings:40% of participants took dietary supplements.19% of participants believed that dietary supplements could reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.Women, participants meeting five-a-day fruit and vegetable recommendations, and those believing that dietary supplements were important for reducing the risk of cancer recurrence were more likely to use dietary supplements.Participants with obesity were less likely to use dietary supplements.Fish oils were the most commonly used dietary supplements, taken by 13% of participants.Calcium with or without vitamin D were the supplements most commonly used by individuals with breast cancer, taken by 15%.Omega-3 fatty acid, carotenoid and vitamin E supplementation improves working memory in older adults: A randomised clinical trialNutrition Research Centre Ireland, December 20, 2021Accumulating evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3FAs), carotenoids and vitamin E can improve cognitive performance.

- Probiotics are live microorganisms typically consumed as a supplement to improve gut health.Among the 128 patients whose dietary fiber intake was known, those who reported consuming at least 20 grams of dietary fiber per day (an amount the researchers designated as "sufficient" for the purposes of this study) lived longer without their cancer progressing than those who consumed less dietary fiber. 

- Every 5-gram increase in daily dietary fiber intake corresponded to a 30% lower risk of progression of the disease.Dr. 

- "The study authors pointed out that such signaling can be key to mounting an effective defense against various health conditions—including cancer, multiple sclerosis or even COVID-19—given that interferon proteins effectively act as immune system triggers.Among seriously ill COVID-19 patients in particular, Chandran noted, insufficient interferon activity has been cited as a problem.He explained that nearly all (97%) of interferon "response genes" were found to be activated following the mediation retreat. 

- But relying on publicly available gene activity data derived from COVID-19 patients, Chandran and his colleagues reported that figure to be 76% among those with mild COVID illness, and just 31% among the most severe cases.At the same time, the investigators found that while inflammation-signaling gene activity remained stable following in-depth meditation, such signaling shot up among severely ill COVID-19 patients.Even light-intensity exercise might reduce dementia riskYonsei University College of Medicine (South Korea), December 22, 2021In a new study, researchers have identified an association between light-intensity physical exercise in older adults and a reduced risk of dementia.In the present study, researchers investigated whether there was an association between doing light-intensity physical exercise and a reduced risk of developing dementia in older adults.The study involved 62,286 participants who were 65 years or older, did not have a dementia diagnosis, and had medical records in the Korean National Health Insurance Service database.Researchers gathered data between January 2009 and December 2012 and tracked the participants until the end of December 2013.

- There’s a looming crisis of Covid medical debt. 

- There’s the dental office manager, stricken with long Covid and still too sick to work, drowning in tens of thousands of dollars of medical debt. 

- First, that actual bill is an actual thing, albeit a state rather than federal prospect: on December 6, Illinois state representative Jonathan Carroll advanced legislation to make unvaccinated Covid patients pay out of pocket for the cost of their medical treatment, whether or not they were insured, no matter how astronomical those costs might be. 

- Carroll rescinded the bill a few days later, citing a backlash that included death threats, but not before it found support in some remarkable places — including the Twitter account of the progressive organisation Occupy Democrats, which posted an all-caps clarion call: “Illinois introduces a bill to force unvaccinated residents to pay out of pocket for their hospital treatment if they catch COVID, saying that they ‘must asume [sic] the risk’ and ‘take responsibility’ for their carelessness. 

- RT IF YOU THINK THAT YOUR STATE SHOULD DO THE SAME!” Just a few days later, Atlantic editor David Frum suggested that it was time for the country to return to normal — but while encouraging hospitals to “quietly triage emergency care to serve the unvaccinated last.” And last week, American supermarket chain Kroger announcedthat unvaccinated employees would be subject to a monthly surcharge on their health plans — and that if they contract Covid, they will not be given paid emergency leave. 

- In all these cases, the notion of depriving vaccine holdouts of affordable treatment was met with widespread acclaim — in keeping with the idea, promoted by everyone from the paper of record to the current President, that the pandemic would’ve been over ages ago if only they’d sucked it up and gotten their shot.

- It was a collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), with Dr. Anthony Fauci serving on the leadership council. 

- Also known as the “Vaccine Alliance,” it proclaims a mission to “save lives and protect people’s health,” and states it “helps vaccinate almost half the world’s children against deadly and debilitating infectious diseases.” GAVI goes on to describe its core partnership with various international organizations, including names that are by now familiar: the WHO, UNICEF, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Bank. 

- In 2018, GAVI, through its INFUSE (innovation for update, scale and equity in immunization) Initiative, put forth the following “food for thought”: “Imagine a future in which all children have access to life-saving vaccines no matter where they live — a future in which parents and health workers ensure their timely vaccination, a future in which they have their own digitally stored health record that cannot be lost or stolen, a future in which, regardless of gender, economic or social standing, this record allows each child (and parents) to have access to a bank account, go to school, access services and ultimately build a prosperous life. 

- Highlighting the possibilities that the GAVI-ID2020 collaboration could bring, the INFUSE call for innovation states: “According to the ID2020 Alliance — a public-private partnership that includes Gavi — the use of digital health cards for children could directly improve coverage rates by ensuring a verifiable, accurate record and by prompting parents to bring their children in for a subsequent dose. 

- “And as children grow, their digital health card can be used to access secondary services, such as primary school, or ease the process of obtaining alternative credentials. 

- Effectively, the digital health card could, depending on country needs and readiness, potentially become the first step in establishing a legal, broadly recognized identity.” The final report from these sessions indicates, among other things, a desire from the stakeholders for the expansion of public-private partnerships for the further development and implementation of digital ID regimes worldwide, including in the Global South. 

- One of the stakeholders present, the not-for-profit Secure Identity Alliance, touts its support for “the provision of legal, trusted identity for all and driving the development of inclusive digital services necessary for sustainable, worldwide economic growth and prosperity.” A paper published in July by the Security Identity Alliance discusses “making health certificates a workable reality.” One of the five principles the paper puts forth for such health passports is that they are “futureproofed,” by offering “multi-purpose functionality” in order to “ensure ongoing value beyond today’s current crisis.” Moreover, one of its founding members and current board members is the Thales Group, a private company involved in aerospace, defense and security — in short, a defense contractor. 

- On its website, the Thales Group proudly promotes its “smart health card” and Digital ID Wallettechnology. 

- If passed by Congress, this law would provide $400 million in funding to expand vaccine-tracking systems at the state and local level, enabling state health officials to monitor the vaccination status of American citizens and to provide this information to the federal government.

Flavor your food with 'flavanols (flavan-3-ols)' to burn excess fat, new study suggestsDietary intake of flavanols (flavan-3-ols), type of dietary polyphenolics, could help prevent obesity by sympathetic nervous system-induced browning of fat tissueShibaura Institute of Technology, December 13, 2021In cold conditions, brown adipose tissue (BAT) or brown fat generates heat to keep the body warm. 

- The stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) after cold exposure, exercise, and calorie restriction is well known to induce fat browning. 

- “Oral administration of FLs likely activate the SNS because they are considered stressors in these models,” explains Prof Osakabe.The team then used the obtained adipose tissue to investigate the effects of long-term FL treatment. 

- “Further studies will be required to understand how this process is induced by FL-rich foods,” she concludes.Discrimination increases risk for mental health issues in young adultsUniversity of California at Los Angeles, November 9, 2021A UCLA study has found that young adults who have experienced discrimination have a higher risk for both short- and long-term behavioral and mental health problems.Researchers examined a decade’s worth of health data on 1,834 Americans who were between 18 and 28 years old when the study began. 

- They found that the effects of discrimination may be cumulative — that the greater number of incidents of discrimination someone experiences, the more their risk for mental and behavioral problems increases.The study also suggests that the effects of discrimination in young adults are connected with disparities in care for mental health concerns and institutional discrimination in health care overall, including inequities in diagnoses, treatment and health outcomes.The study was published today in the journal Pediatrics.Previous studies have linked discrimination — whether due to racism, sexism, ageism, physical appearance or other biases — to a higher risk for mental illness, psychological distress and drug use. 

- While previous research has examined the correlation in childhood or later adulthood, this new study is the first to focus on the transition to adulthood and to follow the same group of individuals over time.“With 75% of all lifetime mental health disorders presenting by age 24, the transition to adulthood is a crucial time to prevent mental and behavioral health problems,” said Yvonne Lei, a medical student at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and the study’s corresponding author.Lei also said the findings are particularly relevant in light of the stresses young adults are facing nationwide today.“The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront new mental health challenges — particularly for vulnerable populations,” she said. 

- “We have the opportunity to rethink and improve mental health services to acknowledge the impact of discrimination, so we can better address it to provide more equitable care delivery.”Researchers used data spanning 2007 to 2017 from the University of Michigan’s Transition to Adulthood Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics survey. 

- Overall, people who experienced any amount of discrimination had a 26% greater risk for poor health than people who said they did not experience discrimination.During the 10-year period, young adults in the study who had experienced multiple successive years of high-frequency discrimination showed a much more pronounced, cumulative risk for mental illness, psychological distress, drug use and worse overall health.The findings shed light on the multidimensional impact of discrimination on mental and behavioral health and overall well-being.“The associations we found are likely also intertwined with mental health care service disparities — including inequities in care access, provider biases and structural and institutional discrimination in health care — leading to inequities in diagnoses, treatment and outcomes,” said the study’s senior author, Dr. Adam Schickedanz, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Geffen School of Medicine.Saffron: A Safe and Effective Treatment for Postpartum DepressionMashhad University of Medical Sciences (Iran)  December 11, 2021Postpartum depression is a mood disorder that affects as many as 1 in 7 new mothers. 

- [1]  Currently, the only approved medical treatments for postpartum depression are talk therapy and psychiatric medications. 

- [2] Beyond saffron’s delicate flavor, often described as sweet and “hay like”, and rich golden hue used in traditional dyes, saffron’s use as a medicinal herb has been documented for more than 4,000 years.In this study, researchers wanted to identify a non-pharmaceutical treatment option for breastfeeding mothers suffering from mild-to-moderate postpartum depressive disorder (PPD). 

- Researchers determined conclusively that “saffron had large treatment effects” on depression. 

- In this 2013 review of five studies on saffron for major depressive disorder, researchers noted that a “large effect” was seen in saffron-treated patients versus placebo, concluding that “saffron supplementation can improve symptoms of depression in adults with major depressive disorder.”[5]Saffron’s impressive ability to elevate mood is backed-up by at least seven additional proven health benefits. 

- Rich in B vitamins and manganese, adding this beautiful spice to your diet also provides a nutritional boost.Regular exercise reduces the risk of and death from pneumonia, study suggestsUniversity of Bristol, December 7, 2021People who exercise regularly can reduce their risk of developing and dying from pneumonia, new research has found. 

- The study, led by the University of Bristol and published in GeroScience, analysed, for the first time, ten population cohort studies with over one million participants.The benefits of regular exercise are well-known and can reduce the risk, length or severity of infectious diseases. 

- Previous research has suggested that regular exercise might be associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia, but the studies have had mixed findings with some reporting evidence of a relationship and others no evidence.The researchers carried out a pooled analysis of all published studies to re-evaluate the relationship between regular exercise and the risk of developing pneumonia.The questions the study aimed to answer included:Is there an association between regular physical activity and future risk of pneumonia?If there is an association, what is the strength and nature of the association?If there is an association, is it stronger or weaker in specific groups of people?The study found people who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing pneumonia and pneumonia-related death compared to those who were the least or not physically active. 

- The strength of the association did not vary by age or sex.Dr Setor Kunutsor, Senior Lecturer in Evidence Synthesis in the Bristol Medical School: Translational Health Sciences (THS) and corresponding author on the paper, said: “In this first-ever pooled analysis of all studies conducted on the topic, we found strong and convincing evidence of a relationship between regular exercise and reduction in a person’s risk of developing pneumonia as well as death from the disease. 

- Taking regular physical activity could reduce the risk of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 especially in at-risk groups like older adults and those with underlying health conditions.”The research does not prove cause and effect and further studies are needed to show if the associations demonstrated are causal. 

- Also, additional work should be carried out to confirm the amount and intensity of physical activity, which is essential for the prevention of pneumonia or pneumonia-related deaths.Finally, because regular exercise was self-reported, the values could be biased so future studies should focus on accurately assessing physical activity with the use of accelerometers or pedometers.Pneumonia is an infection of the lung tissue usually caused by bacteria or viruses and is a leading cause of death among older people, the young, and people with pre-existing health conditions. 

- In 2016 the disease was the fourth leading cause of death in the world.Pneumonia is also associated with ill health, reduced quality of life, and high healthcare costs. 

- Smoking, heavy drinking, respiratory conditions such as asthma, and chronic diseases such as diabetes and kidney disease, are well known to increase the risk of pneumonia, which is a preventable cause of death and disability.The study’s findings add to the well documented evidence that regular physical activity has the potential to reduce the risk of several chronic diseases, infectious diseases such as pneumonia, as well as death. 

- Physical activity has huge benefits on overall health, as well as reducing healthcare costs caused by pre-existing health conditions.A daily dose of yoghurt could be the go-to food to manage high blood pressureUniversity of South Australia and University of Maine, December 7, 2021Whether it’s a dollop on your morning cereal or a simple snack on the go, a daily dose of yoghurt could be the next go-to food for people with high blood pressure, according to new research from the University of South Australia.Conducted in partnership with the University of Maine, the study examined the associations between yoghurt intake, blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors, finding that yoghurt is associated with lower blood pressure for those with hypertension.Globally, more than a billion people suffer from hypertension (high blood pressure), putting them at greater risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as heart attack and stroke.CVDs are the leading cause of death worldwide – in the United States, one person dies from CVD every 36 seconds; in Australia, it’s every 12 minutes.UniSA researcher Dr Alexandra Wade says this study provides new evidence that connects yoghurt with positive blood pressure outcomes for hypertensive people.“High blood pressure is the number one risk factor for cardiovascular disease, so it’s important that we continue to find ways to reduce and regulate it,” Dr Wade says.“Dairy foods, especially yoghurt, may be capable of reducing blood pressure.“This is because dairy foods contain a range of micronutrients, including calcium, magnesium and potassium, all of which are involved in the regulation of blood pressure.“Yoghurt is especially interesting because it also contains bacteria that promote the release of proteins which lowers blood pressure.“This study showed for people with elevated blood pressure, even small amounts of yoghurt were associated with lower blood pressure.“And for those who consumed yoghurt regularly, the results were even stronger, with blood pressure readings nearly seven points lower than those who did not consume yoghurt.”The study was conducted on 915 community-dwelling adults from the Maine–Syracuse Longitudinal Study. 

- High blood pressure was defined as being greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg (a normal blood pressure level is less than 120/80 mmHg).Researchers say that future observational and intervention studies should continue to focus on at-risk individuals to examine the potential benefits of yogurt.Infrared sauna helps remove heavy metals and prevent cancerUniversity of Munich, December 13, 2021You’re about to discover the underappreciated health benefits of infrared sauna therapy. 

- Raising body heat can speed the death of tumors, as well as helping clear the body of carcinogens that contributed to their formation in the first place.Hyperthermia, or heat therapy, is acknowledged by the American Cancer Society as a “promising” way to improve cancer treatment, while the National Cancer Institute reports heat therapy has been shown to reduce tumor size is some cases.In a review published in Lancet Oncology in 2002, researchers noted that heat therapy has shown a beneficial effect in controlling certain types of cancer – such as breast cancer and malignant melanoma – and boosting survival rates in patients.But when it comes to treating cancer, an infrared sauna is not a magic bullet, or even a “single” bullet. 

- Both mainstream and holistic practitioners agree: heat therapy must be combined with other forms of cancer treatment, for best results.Infrared saunas use multiple actions to fight cancerIn addition to killing cancer cells outright, infrared saunas combat cancer by helping to improve oxygen-carrying blood flow – important because cancer cells can’t thrive in high-oxygen environments. 

- While far infrared saunas use metallic, ceramic or black carbon elements, near infrared lamp saunas utilize 250-watt incandescent red heat lamps – the same type that can be seen heating French fries at burger outlets.In addition, near infrared sauna rays penetrate the skin to a distance of 3 inches, while far infrared rays only penetrate 1.5 inches.Proponents of near infrared saunas point to their absence of EMFs – electromagnetic frequencies – as a benefit; Although proponents of far infrared saunas acknowledge their saunas emit more EMFs, they say the effect is negligible.In the end, only you can decide which is right for you.Of course, always consult a trusted, knowledgeable holistic practitioner before using either type of sauna – especially if you suffer from a chronic disease condition.

- Its deficiency is just as significant, and perhaps more so, than more commonly discussed underlying medical conditions, including obesity. 

- Other studies On a par with the German study was an important US medical article from May 2021: Vitamin D and Its Potential Benefit for the COVID-19 Pandemic. 

- It noted: “Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D exerts several actions that are thought to be protective against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infectivity and severity. 

- … There are a growing number of data connecting COVID-19 infectivity and severity with vitamin D status, suggesting a potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation for primary prevention or as an adjunctive treatment of COVID-19.

- The WEF’s Edison Alliance, whose “vision is for every person to affordably participate in the digital economy,” published its “Shared Guiding Principles for Digital Health Inclusion” white paper on Tuesday, outlining the importance of “digital health identity” in the overall scheme. 

- “The health ID should allow individuals to be uniquely identified, authenticated, and linked to their health records, with informed consent” — “Shared Guiding Principles for Digital Health Inclusion,” WEF, 2021 Out of the seven principles, the third is dedicated to “digital health identity,” which includes action points such as: Promoting digital citizenship to give patients and their caregivers the ability to understand their own health records and care plans Focusing on a health identity (ID) to maintain and access longitudinal individual health records, which are essential for connected care and continuum of care, portability of health records, interoperability and patient control The health ID should allow individuals to be uniquely identified, authenticated, and linked to their health records, with informed consent The ID should enable improved access to care in different geographies, for all levels of care (primary to tertiary), as well as for different disease conditions and in government health programs Getting everyone on the planet connected to the internet is key to digital health inclusion. 

- And while the unelected globalists say that individuals should always be in control of their own health information, they completely ignore that individuals are being coerced into giving up control of their data in order to restore freedoms that never should have been taken away in the first place. 

- Take vaccine passports for example, which the World Health Organization says actually “may increase the risk of disease spread.” The WEF white paper goes on to say that “caregivers and patients should remain in control of medical decisions,” yet we are seeing the exact opposite of that happening all over the world wherever draconian vaccine mandates are enforced. 

- Principle six in the report is about “using health data safely and responsibly to ensure inclusion while safeguarding informed consent, privacy and confidentiality.” This section emphasizes data ownership, the right to opt out, and informed consent — none of which are being respected by public and private entities throughout the world.

- (NEXT)Israeli study says COVID shot efficacy decreases dramatically after 3 months, calls for boostersBritish Medical Journal, November 24, 2021 A study published by The BMJ today finds a gradual increase in the risk of COVID-19 infection from 90 days after receiving a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. 

- The study was carried out by the Research Institute of Leumit Health Services in Israel. 

- To do this, the researchers examined electronic health records for 80,057 adults (average age 44 years) who received a PCR test at least three weeks after their second injection, and had no evidence of previous COVID-19 infection.

- So, for those of you who didn’t get to see the video (I imagine that is all of you since it was up for less than 24 hours), I talked at length about the ‘don’t’s of injecting pre-pubescent children with experimental products for which the ingredient list is a big secret for a ‘disease’ that they do not succumb to. 

- Here’s what I found in their COVID-19 medical misinformation policy. 

- Treatment misinformation: Content that encourages the use of home remedies, prayer, or rituals in place of medical treatment such as consulting a doctor or going to the hospital Content that claims that there’s a guaranteed cure for COVID-19 Content that recommends use of Ivermectin or Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 Claims that Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID-19 Categorical claims that Ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19 Claims that Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine are safe to use in the treatment COVID-19 Other content that discourages people from consulting a medical professional or seeking medical advice Ok. 

- I AM a medical sciences professional. 

- Doesn’t that make your dictate of discouraging ‘consulting a medical professional’ moot? 

- As a Medical Scientist. 

- That’s one of the things that our bloody immune systems are for and very good it - preventing disease. 

- Kids that age NEVER get tachycardia (i.e., the medical experts I’ve talked to have never seen it before in their careers). 

- The medical system, despite claims of physician autonomy, actually offers very little, as it takes very little to be thrown out of the system. 

- Medicare, the FDA, a state medical board, a malpractice insurer, the DEA, a hospital medical staff, an employer - you only have to cross one of these to have your career ruined. 

- Combine that with the idea that most physicians wouldn't be willing to stand against a medical establishment agency such as the CDC (the ones who will have long since been ostracized) and that to do so would require a huge amount of energy and time spent on medical paper research to make a case (and most docs don't have time for that) and that most of medicine is necessarily a form of group think anyway. 

- Then add on to it that the policy makers in large medical corporations roles are more immediately to protect the interests of the corporation than to "save the world," and you arrive at our current situation. 

- Hospitals and medical facilities have already fired vaccine hesitant employees per vaccine mandates thereby self selecting for vax believers.

- (OTHER NEWS NEXT)The Madness of Anthony FauciRather than own up to his disastrous policy and medical advice, Fauci instead is accelerating his messianic impulses.By Julie KellyIt’s nearly impossible to select the most maniacal comment made by Dr. Anthony Fauci in his nearly 70-minute interview with “Face the Nation” host Margaret Brennan that aired over the weekend. 

- And that’s the reason why [it] may take a little bit longer.” When parents question whether it’s necessary to vaccinate children, Fauci replies that, “yeah, we do want to be vaccinating the children because we want to vaccinate and protect everyone in society, including children.” Now, that is not the conclusion of a sound man of science, as Fauci again insisted he is in the interview, or even a man of common sense and humanity—that is the raving of a madman.Only a demon would propose injecting a child, including babies who cannot yet even walk or talk, with a rushed “vaccine” to allegedly minimize a virus that poses no serious health threat to them. 

- Only a sociopath would dismiss parental fears about not just the medical necessity of the shot for the child but also unknown side effects that their children could suffer in both the near and long term. 

- He violated the Hatch Act by using his government post for political purposes; for example, the weekend before the 2020 election, Fauci told the Washington Post that Joe Biden “is taking [the pandemic] seriously from a public health perspective,” but that Trump was only looking at it from an economic standpoint. 

- Rather than own up to his disastrous policy and medical advice, Fauci instead is accelerating his messianic impulses. 

- If indeed he is “America’s doctor,” as Margaret Brennan so obsequiously claimed, and to which Fauci agreed, then he should be properly investigated for medical malpractice at the very least. 

- Undaunted by the increasing implausibility of the lockdown narrative, the global health bureaucrats are nonetheless doubling down on forced vaccines—as we now see in Austria—and we continue to be assured that only countries with high vaccination rates can hope to avoid disastrous covid outcomes. 

- For example, the AP reported this week that in spite of low vaccination rates, Africa has fared better than most of the world: [T]here is something “mysterious” going on in Africa that is puzzling scientists, said Wafaa El-Sadr, chair of global health at Columbia University. 

- In any case, the World Health Organization reports that covid deaths in Africa make up only 2.9 percent of covid deaths, while Africa’s population is 16 percent of the global total. 

- HEALTH NEWSMay be worth adopting plant based diet to ease chronic migraine severity, say doctorsStony Brook University and University of Pennsylvania, November 22, 2021Prescribed meds, elimination diet, yoga and meditation provided no or little symptom reliefBoosting dark green leafy veg intake may be keyIt may be worth adopting a plant based diet, rich in dark green leafy vegetables, to ease the symptoms of chronic migraine, suggest doctors in the online journal BMJ Case Reports.The recommendation comes after they treated a man who had endured severe migraine headaches without aura for more than 12 years. 

- On a scale of 0–10, he scored the pain severity as 10–12 out of 10.The report authors advised the man to adopt the Low Inflammatory Foods Everyday (LIFE) diet, a nutrient dense, whole food, plant-based diet.The LIFE diet includes eating at least five ounces by weight of raw or cooked dark green leafy vegetables every day, drinking one 32-ounce daily green LIFE smoothie, and limiting intake of whole grains, starchy vegetables, oils, and animal protein, particularly dairy and red meat.After 3 months his migraines stopped completely, and they haven't returned in 7.5 years.Exercising at the start of fast can help people reach ketosis 3.5 hours faster: studyBrigham Young University, November 24, 2021Now a new Brigham Young University study published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise finds that exercising intensely at the start of a fast may help maximize health benefits of temporarily foregoing food.Ketosis occurs when the body runs out of glucose—its first, preferred fuel—and begins breaking down stored fat for energy, producing chemicals called ketones as a byproduct. 

- Each fast began after a standardized meal, the first fast starting without exercise and the other with a challenging treadmill workout.Exercise made a big difference: when participants exercised, they reached ketosis on average three and a half hours earlier in the fast and produced 43% more BHB. 

- The theory is that the initial exercise burns through a substantial amount of the body's glucose, prompting a quicker transition to ketosis. 

- Without exercise, the participants hit ketosis about 20 to 24 hours into the fast.To calm your emotions, get 15 minutes aloneUniversity of Rochester, November 24, 2021Being by yourself—even for just 15 minutes—may decrease your strong positive and negative emotions, and instead reduce stress and induce calm, a new study suggests.Lead researcher Thuy-vy Nguyen, a doctoral candidate in clinical and social sciences in psychology at the University of Rochester, together with the cofounders of self-determination theory, psychology professors Richard Ryan and Edward Deci, conclude that solitude can lead to relaxation and stress reduction—as long as people actively chose to be alone.In general, solitude, the research finds, has a lessening effect not only on arousing positive emotions but also strong negative emotions, ultimately leaving people calmer, more relaxed, less angry, and less anxious.The researchers define solitude as “a psychological experience of being alone without communications, stimuli, activities, or devices that might facilitate virtual communications such as text messaging or social media.”Fermented tea could help protect the liver from high-fat diet damageTianjin University (China), November 30, 2021Water extracts of a fermented tea, known as Pu-erh tea, could help to reduce oxidative stress and protect the liver against damage caused by a high fat diet, research in rats has found.The study, published in Food Science and Human Wellness, investigated the potential of the polyphenol and theabrownin-rich fermented tea to protect the liver after previous studies linked the tea to a raft of health benefits.“Pu-erh tea can be used as a potential healthy drink for prevention and/or treatment of fatty liver disease and many diseases associated with oxidative stress,” suggested Jing and colleagues.After the trial, they found that the Pu-erh extract led to decreases in body weight, fat index, MDA and NOS levels.

- With a new diagnosis of prostate cancer, these men have approximately a 30% incidence of depression and anxiety, a fourfold higher risk of heart attack and a twofold higher risk of committing suicide.Yoga, a set of specific body postures combined with breathing techniques and mindfulness, may be an easy-to-implement answer in this stressful situation, according to a study published Nov. 23 in the journal Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases.A pilot randomized clinical trial by urology researchers at the Mays Cancer Center, home to UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center, enrolled 29 men who were awaiting prostatectomy. 

- Fourteen were randomized to participate in yoga and 15 were assigned to the standard of care, which was just waiting for surgery.“We gave the active intervention group six weeks of yoga, at least twice a week, for 60 to 75 minutes,” said lead author Dharam Kaushik, MD, associate professor of urology in UT Health San Antonio’s Joe R. and Teresa Lozano School of Medicine and cancer surgeon with the Mays Cancer Center.Via questionnaires, the team documented the men’s perceived quality of life at the start of yoga, at the time of surgery and after surgery. 

- Changes in immune cell status and inflammatory markers with yoga were secondary outcomes.The yoga group showed increased numbers of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which are important contributors to immune health.

- 'We really believe this method can lead to treatment of patients, who otherwise have poor prospects. 

- However, when the same test was conducted in the afternoon, no improvement was seen.Scientists say the benefits of deep red light, highlighted by the findings, mark a breakthrough for eye health and should lead to affordable home-based eye therapies, helping the millions of people globally with naturally declining vision.Lead author, Professor Glen Jeffery (UCL Institute of Ophthalmology), said: “We demonstrate that one single exposure to long wave deep red light in the morning can significantly improve declining vision, which is a major health and wellbeing issue, affecting millions of people globally.“This simple intervention applied at the population level would significantly impact on quality of life as people age and would likely result in reduced social costs that arise from problems associated with reduced vision.”Naturally declining vision and mitochondriaIn humans around 40 years old, cells in the eye’s retina begin to age, and the pace of this ageing is caused, in part, when the cell’s mitochondria, whose role is to produce energy (known as ATP) and boost cell function, also start to decline.Mitochondrial density is greatest in the retina’s photoreceptor cells, which have high energy demands. 

- This study focused on cones*** and observed colour contrast sensitivity, along the protan axis (measuring red-green contrast) and the tritan axis (blue-yellow).All the participants were aged between 34 and 70, had no ocular disease, completed a questionnaire regarding eye health prior to testing, and had normal colour vision (cone function). 

- It is possible that there are other variables between individuals that influence the degree of improvement that the researchers have not identified so far and would require a larger sample size.This research was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, and Sight Research UK.Global rise in red/processed meat trade linked to sharp increase in diet-related illnessMichigan State University & University of California at Merced, November 22, 2021The global rise in the red and processed meat trade over the past 30 years is linked to a sharp increase in diet related ill health, with the impact greatest in Northern and Eastern Europe and the island nations of the Caribbean and Oceania, finds an analysis published in the open access journal BMJ Global Health.Health policies should be integrated with agricultural and trade policies among importing and exporting nations as a matter of urgency, to stave off further personal and societal costs, say the researchers.Among continuous urbanisation and income growth, the global red and processed meat trade has risen exponentially to meet demand. 

- This trend has implications for the environment because of the impact it has on land use and biodiversity loss.And high red and processed meat consumption is linked to a heightened risk of non-communicable diseases, particularly bowel cancer, diabetes, and coronary artery heart disease.The researchers wanted to find out what impact the red and processed meat trade might be having on diet-related non-communicable disease trends and which countries might be particularly vulnerable.They drew on data on meat production and trade from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) from 1993 to 2018 for 154 countries, focusing on 14 red meat items derived from beef, pork, lamb and goat, and six processed primarily beef and pork items, preserved by smoking, salting, curing, or chemicals.They then calculated the proportions of deaths and years of life lived with disability (DALYs) attributable to diet as a result of bowel cancer, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery heart disease among those aged 25 and over in each country.The global red and processed meat trade increased by more than 148% from 10 metric tonnes in 1993–5 to nearly 25 metric tonnes in 2016–18.While the number of net exporting countries fell from 33 in 1993–5 to 26 in 2016–18, net importing countries rose from 121 to 128.Developed countries in Europe accounted for half of total red and processed meat exports in 1993–95 and 2016–18. 

- But developing countries in South America, such as Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay made up nearly 10% in 2016–18, up from around 5% in 1993–5.Developing countries also increased their meat imports by 342.5% from 2 metric tonnes in 1993–5 to nearly 9 metric tonnes in 2016–18; developed countries doubled theirs from 8 metric tonnes to 16.Diet related attributable death and DALY rates associated with the global meat trade rose in three quarters of the 154 countries between 1993-5 and 2016-18.Worldwide, the researchers calculated that increases in red and processed meat consumption, aligned to increases in trade, accounted for 10,898 attributable deaths in 2016–18, an increase of nearly 75% on the figures for 1993-5.The global meat trade contributed to increases of 55% and 71%, respectively, in attributable deaths and DALYs in developed countries between 1993-5 and 2016-18.The equivalent figures in developing countries were significantly higher: 137% and 140%, respectively, largely as a result of increased demand for meat, prompted by rapid urbanisation and income growth, suggest the researchers.Between 1993– 2018, island nations in the Caribbean and Oceania and  countries in Northern and Eastern Europe became particularly vulnerable to diet-related disease and deaths associated with large meat imports.The island nations have limited land for meat production, so depend heavily on meat imports, while many of the European countries, such as Slovakia, Lithuania and Latvia, benefited from regional trade agreements and tariff exemptions after joining the European Union in 2003-4, which accelerated meat imports, explain the researchers.In 1993–5, the top 10 countries with the highest proportion of deaths attributable to red meat consumption included Tonga, United Arab Emirates, Barbados, Fiji, Gabon, Bahamas, Greece, Malta, Brunei and Saint Lucia.In 2016–2018, the top 10 included The Netherlands, Bahamas, Tonga, Denmark, Antigua and Barbuda, Seychelles, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Croatia and Greece. 

- And the researchers acknowledge that many countries import and process red meat items for export, which may have skewed their findings.Nevertheless, they conclude: “This study shows that global increases in red and processed meat trade contribute to the abrupt increase of diet-related [non-communicable diseases]... Future interventions need to urgently integrate health policies with agricultural and trade policies by cooperating between responsible exporting and importing countries.”Glyphosate levels sharply increase by 1,208% within the human bodyUniversity of California San DiegoThe environmental dangers of glyphosate in Roundup and other weed killer products have been well documented. 

- Now new research, from a team led by Paul Mills of the University of California San Diego, has found it could be negatively affecting human health – especially in lower-income communities, as illustrated by the 1,208 percent increase in human glyphosate levels.The study tracked people in southern California over age 50 from the years 1993 to 1996 as well as from 2014 to 2016. 

- And, for some, glyphosate levels surged by a frightening 1,208 percent.A past UK trial of rats fed low doses of glyphosate – over their lifetimes – were found to have a higher risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. 

- Research out of King’s College in London found this toxic herbicide ingredient can cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats at just 4 nanograms/kg.By the way, this amount is 437,000 times below levels that are allowed in the United States.In more recent research, the levels of glyphosate in the humans studied were proportionately 100-fold higher. 

- Further research regarding the connection between glyphosate and liver disease are being planned. 

- Yet, traces of this herbicide ingredient – left on fruits and vegetables – can easily make its way into the bloodstream of anyone who consumes these foods.Glyphosate weed killer in Roundup considered “probable carcinogen” by World Health OrganizationWhile Roundup was developed to kill weeds, many weed types have actually become resistant to the herbicide. 

- This is causing some farmers to use even more Roundup.Glyphosate has been listed as a “probable human carcinogen” by WHO (the World Health Organization). 

- Studies on humans have shown Roundup causes liver damage even when found in “permissible amounts” in tap water.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease currently affects 90 million Americans and is on the verge of becoming a global epidemic. 

- Associated disorders such as diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome are also soaring.Glyphosate in Roundup weed killer INCREASES the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseaseWhile the known causes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease include overeating, sugary foods and a sedentary lifestyle, some health professionals are beginning to wonder if glyphosate exposure is exacerbating this trend.NAFLD symptoms include chronic fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain and/or swelling, weight loss, jaundice, itching, confusion and swelling of the legs. 

- "These findings highlight adults who are microdosing to treat their mental health conditions and enhance their wellbeing—rather than simply to get high," says Dr. Walsh. 

- "We have an epidemic of mental health problems, with existing treatments that don't work for everyone.

- The IEG’s mission focuses on “pioneering a new asset class based on natural assets and the mechanism to convert them to financial capital.” “These assets,” IEG states, make “life on Earth possible and enjoyable…They include biological systems that provide clean air, water, foods, medicines, a stable climate, human health and societal potential.” Put differently, NACs will not only allow ecosystems to become financial assets, but the rights to “ecosystem services”, or the benefits people receive from nature as well. 

- These sales can be gauged to reflect the increase in capital value of the stock, roughly in-line with its profitability, creating cashflow based on the health of the company and its assets.” Researcher and journalist Cory Morningstar has strongly disagreed with the approach being taken by NYSE/IEG and views NACs as a system that will only exacerbate the corporate predation of nature, despite claims to the contrary.

- These diets could be better for your bank balance as well as for your health and…the planet.”Miguel Barclay, author of the bestselling “One Pound Meals” series of cookbooks, says, “I definitely agree that cutting down your meat, or cutting it out completely, will save you money. 

- It found that making healthy and sustainable diets affordable everywhere is possible within the next 10 years when economic development, especially in lower income countries, is paired with reductions in food waste and a climate and health-friendly pricing of foods.“Affording to eat a healthy and sustainable diet is possible everywhere, but requires political will,” according to Dr. Springmann. 

- Any of the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns we looked at are a better option for health, the environment, and financially, but development support and progressive food policies are needed to make them both affordable and desirable everywhere.”The study, “The global and regional costs of healthy and sustainable dietary patterns: a modeling study,” is published in The Lancet Planetary Health on 10 November 2021. 

- The trials compared resveratrol to a placebo with or without concurrent antidiabetic medications or other drug treatment.Resveratrol doses of 500 milligrams or more were associated with lower fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, insulin resistance, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure in comparison with a placebo. 

- The most appropriate glycemic control effect was fulfilled when consumed for at least one month with doses of 500 mg or more.”Exercise linked to better mental healthKaiser Permanente Research, November 11, 2021Kaiser Permanente research published on November 11 in Preventive Medicine showed people who exercised more during the initial lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced less anxiety and depression than those who didn’t exercise. 

- It also showed that people who spent more time outdoors typically experienced lower levels of anxiety and depression than those who stayed inside.More than 20,000 people participated in the survey-based study from 6 regions served by Kaiser Permanente across the United States, which included Hawaii, Colorado, Georgia, and the mid-Atlantic states, as well as Southern and Northern California.“What these study findings tell us is that even during an active pandemic or other public health crisis, people should be encouraged to be physically active to help maintain their physical and mental health,” said the study’s lead author Deborah Rohm Young, PhD, the director of the Division of Behavioral Research for the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Department of Research & Evaluation. 

- “Parks and other nature areas should remain open during public health emergencies to encourage outdoor physical activity.”In March 2020, COVID-19 developed into a worldwide pandemic. 

- With no known treatment, public health officials attempted to reduce its spread by limiting human interactions through stay-at-home policies. 

- These stressful factors, along with fewer opportunities to socialize with friends and family, increased symptoms of depression and anxiety for many people.Since it is known that physical activity and time spent in nature are associated with improved mental health, researchers at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California sought to determine how exercise and time outdoors was associated with people’s mental health during the height of the pandemic.In April 2020, researchers sent a series of COVID-19 surveys to more than 250,000 participants in the Kaiser Permanente Research Bank — a collection of lifestyle surveys, electronic health record data, and biospecimens, which Kaiser Permanente members volunteered. 

- The study found that:Reports of anxiety and depression decreased over timeAnxiety and depression scores were higher for females and younger people, and lower for Asian and Black people compared with white respondentsParticipants who reported no physical activity reported the highest depression and anxiety compared to people who had exercisedSpending less time outdoors was associated with higher depression and anxiety scoresPeople who had increased their time outdoors the most reported the highest anxiety scores, but the research could not explain the finding“What we learned from these findings is that during future emergencies it will be important to carefully weigh the decisions to close parks and outdoor areas against the negative impact those closures may have on people’s mental health,” said Dr. Young.Bedtime linked with heart healthUniversity of Exeter (UK), November 9, 2021Going to sleep between 10:00 and 11:00 pm is associated with a lower risk of developing heart disease compared to earlier or later bedtimes, according to a study published today in European Heart Journal—Digital Health, a journal of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).“The body has a 24-hour internal clock, called circadian rhythm, that helps regulate physical and mental functioning,” said study author Dr. David Plans of the University of Exeter, UK. 

- “While we cannot conclude causation from our study, the results suggest that early or late bedtimes may be more likely to disrupt the body clock, with adverse consequences for cardiovascular health.”While numerous analyses have investigated the link between sleep duration and cardiovascular disease, the relationship between sleep timing and heart disease is underexplored. 

- Participants completed demographic, lifestyle, health and physical assessments and questionnaires. 

- They were then followed up for a new diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, which was defined as a heart attack, heart failure, chronic ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and transient ischaemic attack.During an average follow-up of 5.7 years, 3,172 participants (3.6%) developed cardiovascular disease. 

- Incidence was highest in those with sleep times at midnight or later and lowest in those with sleep onset from 10:00 to 10:59 pm.The researchers analyzed the association between sleep onset and cardiovascular events after adjusting for age, sex, sleep duration, sleep irregularity (defined as varied times of going to sleep and waking up), self-reported chronotype (early bird or night owl), smoking status, body mass index, diabetes, blood pressure, blood cholesterol and socioeconomic status.Compared to sleep onset from 10:00 to 10:59 pm, there was a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular disease with a sleep onset at midnight or later, a 12% greater risk for 11:00 to 11:59 pm, and a 24% raised risk for falling asleep before 10:00 pm. 

- Plans said: “Our study indicates that the optimum time to go to sleep is at a specific point in the body’s 24-hour cycle and deviations may be detrimental to health. 

- Plans noted that the reasons for the observed stronger association between sleep onset and cardiovascular disease in women is unclear. 

- If our findings are confirmed in other studies, sleep timing and basic sleep hygiene could be a low-cost public health target for lowering risk of heart disease.”Garlic compounds may boost cardio health indirectly via gut microbiotaNational Taiwan University, November 6 2021Allicin from garlic may prevent the metabolism of unabsorbed L-carnitine or choline into TMAO, a compound linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, says a new study from the National Taiwan University.TMAO – or trimethylamine N-oxide – has been known to be generated from dietary carnitine through metabolism of gut microbiota, and was recently reported to be an “important gut microbiota-dependent metabolite to cause cardiovascular diseases,” explained Taiwanese researchers in the Journal of Functional Foods .While antibiotics have been found to inhibit TMAO production, concerns over side effects and resistance have limited their use. 

- However, when allicin supplements were provided with the carnitine diet, TMAO levels were significantly reduced.“Surprisingly, the plasma TMAO levels in the mice of ‘carnitine diet + allicin’ treatment group were as low as that of chow diet [control] group,” wrote the researchers. 

- “This result indicated that the metabolic capacity of mice gut microbiota to produce TMAO was completely inhibited by allicin supplement even though provided with carnitine-rich environment in the gut.“It means the functional alteration of gut microbiota induced by carnitine diet can be prevented by addition of another substance with antimicrobial potential derived from food, such as allicin.”Garlic and heart healthThe study adds to the body of scientific literature supporting the potential heart health benefits of garlic and the compounds it contains.Consumer awareness of the health benefits of garlic, mostly in terms of cardiovascular and immune system health, has benefited the supplements industry, particularly since consumers seek the benefits of garlic without the odors that accompany the fresh bulb.The benefits have been linked to the compound allicin, which is not found in fresh garlic: It is only formed when garlic is crushed, which breaks down a compound called diallyl sulphide.Study details“This may offer an opportunity to take advantage of plants’ delicately designed defense system against microorganisms, to protect ourselves by modulating gut microbiota to a healthier status,” wrote the researchersThe Taiwanese researchers divided male C57BL/6(B6) mice into four groups: One group received only the control chow diet; the second group received the carnitine diet (carnitine added to drinking water at a level of 0.02%); the third group received the carnitine diet with supplemental allicin; and the final group received the control diet plus the allicin supplement for six weeks.Results showed that the second group (carnitine diet) had TMAO levels 4–22 times greater than those observed in the control group. 

- “It may offer an opportunity for us to take advantage of plants’ delicately designed defense system against microorganisms, to protect ourselves by modulating gut microbiota to a healthier status.“Our research also suggested that allicin and dietary fresh garlic containing allicin might be used as functional foods for the prevention of atherosclerosis,” they concluded.Drug used to prevent miscarriage increases risk of cancer in offspringUniversity of Texas Health Science Center, November 9, 2021Exposure in utero to a drug used to prevent miscarriage can lead to an increased risk of developing cancer, according to researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth Houston).The study was published today in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.The drug, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC), is a synthetic progestogen that was frequently used by women in the 1950s and 1960s, and is still prescribed to women today to help prevent preterm birth. 

- Progesterone helps the womb grow during pregnancy and prevents a woman from having early contractions that may lead to miscarriage.“Children who were born to women who received the drug during pregnancy have double the rate of cancer across their lifetime compared to children born to women who did not take this drug,” said Caitlin C. Murphy, PhD, MPH, lead author on the study and associate professor in the Department of Health Promotion and Behavioral Sciences at UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston. 

- “We have seen cancers like colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, and many others increasing in people born in and after the 1960s, and no one really knows why.”Researchers reviewed data from the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan on women who received prenatal care between June 1959 and June 1967, and the California Cancer Registry, which traced cancer in offspring through 2019.Out of more than 18,751 live births, researchers discovered 1,008 cancer diagnoses were made in offspring ages 0 to 58 years.

HEALTH NEWSDiet trumps drugs for anti aging and good metabolic healthUniversity College London, November 15, 2021A study comparing the impact of diet versus drugs on the inner workings of cells has found nutrition has a much stronger impact. 

- The pre-clinical study by the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre suggests the makeup of our diet could be more powerful than drugs in keeping conditions like diabetes, stroke and heart disease at bay.Conducted in mice, the research showed nutrition (including overall calories and macronutrient balance) had a greater impact on aging and metabolic health than three drugs commonly used to treat diabetes and slow down aging. 

- This gives us insights into how diet impacts on health and aging. 

- The report that appeared earlier this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association focused on nearly 27,000 participants across France who took antibody tests to screen for COVID infection.After the subjects had received the antibody test results, researchers asked them whether they believed they had been infected with COVID and to report on symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness or impaired attention.The vast majority of respondents—over 25,000 people—tested negative for COVID antibodies and believed they had never been sick. 

- "Strong links between certain food groups, memory loss and comorbid heart disease or diabetesUniversity of Technology Sydney, November 6, 2021UTS research studied data from 139,000 older Australians and found found high consumption of fruit and vegetables was linked to lowered odds of memory loss and its comorbid heart disease. 

- People aged 80 years and over with a low consumption of cereals are at the highest risk of memory loss and its comorbid heart disease, her research published in the International Journal of Public Health showed. 

- "Our present study implies that the healthy eating suggestions of cereals consumption in the prevention of memory loss and comorbid heart disease for older people may differ compared to other age groups," said Dr. Xu, who holds a Heart Foundation postdoctoral research fellowship.Positive topline results from groundbreaking trial of psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depressionLargest randomised, controlled, double-blind psilocybin therapy study ever completed shows rapid and sustained response for patients receiving a single dose of COMP360 psilocybin with psychological supportColumbia University and COMPASS Pathways plc, November 9, 2021COMPASS Pathways plc (Nasdaq: CMPS) (“COMPASS”), a mental health care company dedicated to accelerating patient access to evidence-based innovation in mental health, today announced that its groundbreaking phase IIb clinical trial of COMP360 psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression has achieved its primary endpoint for the highest dose, with a 25mg dose of COMP360 demonstrating a highly statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in depressive symptom severity after three weeks, with a rapid and durable treatment response*.In the randomised, controlled, double-blind trial, a single dose of investigational COMP360 psilocybin was given to 233 patients in conjunction with psychological support from specially trained therapists. 

- The objective of the trial was to find the appropriate dose for a larger, pivotal phase III programme, which COMPASS expects to begin in 2022.David J Hellerstein MD, a Principal Investigator on the trial and Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said: “Treatment-resistant depression is a common and devastating condition, affecting tens of millions of people, with few effective treatments. 

- We now have evidence from a large well-designed trial that psilocybin may be effective for people with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. 

- Grape consumption benefits gut microbiome and cholesterol metabolismUniversity of California at Los Angeles, November 11, 2021A new clinical study published in the scientific journal Nutrients found that consuming grapes significantly increased the diversity of bacteria in the gut which is considered essential to good health overall. 

- The findings suggest a promising new role for grapes in gut health and reinforce the benefits of grapes on heart health.In the intervention study], healthy subjects consumed the equivalent of 1.5 cups of grapes[2] per day – for four weeks. 

- Bile acids, which are linked to cholesterol metabolism, were decreased by 40.9%.Vitamin D supplementation associated with lower risk of heart attack or death during follow-upKansas City VA Medical Center, November 8 2021.The October 2021 issue of the Journal of the Endocrine Society published findings from a retrospective study of US veterans that uncovered an association between supplementing with vitamin D and a lower risk of heart attack and mortality from any cause during up to 14 years of follow-up.The study included men and women treated at the Kansas City VA Medical Center from 1999-2018 who had low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 20 ng/mL or less. 

- Patients whose vitamin D levels improved the most also experienced significantly greater heart attack-free survival during follow-up than the remainder of the patients.When mortality from any cause during follow-up was examined, men and women whose vitamin D levels improved to 21-29 ng/mL had a 41% lower risk, and those whose levels improved to 30 ng/mL or more had a 39% lower risk than the untreated group.“These results suggest that targeting 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels above 30 ng/mL might improve prognosis in the primary prevention setting among individuals with vitamin D deficiency,” authors Prakash Acharya of the University of Kansas Medical Center and colleagues wrote.Meditative practice and spiritual wellbeing may preserve cognitive function in agingAlzheimer's Research and Prevention Foundation and Thomas Jefferson University, November 12, 2021It is projected that up to 152 million people worldwide will be living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by 2050. 

- A new review in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, published by IOS Press, examines research that finds spiritual fitness, a new concept in medicine that centers on psychological and spiritual wellbeing may reduce multiple risk factors for AD.Research reveals that religious and spiritual involvement can preserve cognitive function as we age. 

- In another study, participants who reported higher levels of PIL exhibited better cognitive function, and further, PIL protected those with already existing pathological conditions, thus slowing their decline.Radiotherapy may explain why childhood cancer survivors often develop metabolic diseaseRockefeller University, November 9, 2021Decades after battling childhood cancer, survivors often face a new challenge: cardiometabolic disease. 

- A spectrum of conditions that includes coronary heart disease and diabetes, cardiometabolic disease typically impacts people who are obese, elderly, or insulin resistant. 

- A new study finds that childhood cancer patients who were treated with abdominal or total body irradiation grow up to display abnormalities in their adipose (fat) tissue, similar to those found in obese individuals with cardiometabolic disease. 

- "Our results imply that the early exposure of fat cells to radiation may cause long-term dysfunction in the adipose tissue that puts childhood cancer survivors at higher risk of cardiometabolic disease. 

- Peanuts, which are actually legumes, but were still part of the study, produced the highest delta response, which is associated with healthy immunity, natural healing, and deep sleep.The study's principal investigator, Lee Berk, DrPH, MPH, associate dean for research at the LLU School of Allied Health Professions, said that while researchers found variances between the six nut varieties tested (almonds, cashews, peanuts, pecans, pistachios and walnuts), all of them were high in beneficial antioxidants, with walnuts containing the highest antioxidant concentrations of all.Why Nitrates And Nitrites In Processed Meats Are Harmful – But Those In Vegetables Aren’tUniversity of Hertfordshire (UK), November 11, 2021While there are many reasons processed meats aren’t great for our health, one reason is because they contain chemicals called nitrates and nitrites.

- It is a common type of heart disease that occurs when plaque builds up in the arteries and hinders proper blood flow. 

- "The study showed EPA adds additional benefit when DHA levels are already high," said study researcher Dr. Francine Welty, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.

- "We've always known pneumonia was a risk factor for a major adverse cardiac event, like a heart attack, within the first 90 days of being diagnosed," said J. Brent Muhlestein, MD, a cardiovascular researcher with the Intermountain Heart Institute at Intermountain Medical Center. 

- "The likely underlying cause is that bacterial pneumonia causes greater inflammation of the arteries compared to viral pneumonia," said Dr. Muhlestein.Researchers find exposure to microplastics may alter cellular functionFlorida State University, November 11, 2021Pollution from miniscule pieces of plastic, or microplastics, have been a growing concern for scientists, public health advocates and environmentalists as these nondegradable items have increasingly made their way into waterways and even the air we breathe.Now, a team researchers found that exposure to microplastics for only a few days caused human lung cells to slow down their metabolism and growth, change shapes, and decluster so that gaps exist in what is typically a solid sheet of cells. 

- The findings raise questions about the long-term effects of microplastics on human health, particularly for those who already have respiratory conditions.The team exposed lung cells in a petri dish to small amounts of polystyrene at levels that are commonly found in the environment and found that though the plastic didn’t cause cell death, it caused some interesting changes. 

- There, police agencies apprehend criminals before they can commit a crime, driverless cars populate the highways, and a person’s biometrics are constantly scanned and used to track their movements, target them for advertising, and keep them under perpetual surveillance.Cue the dawning of the Age of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which internet-connected “things” monitor your home, your health and your habits in order to keep your pantry stocked, your utilities regulated and your life under control and relatively worry-free. 

- In the not-too-distant future, “just about every device you have—and even products like chairs, that you don’t normally expect to see technology in—will be connected and talking to each other.” By the end of 2018, “there were an estimated 22 billion internet of things connected devices in use around the world… Forecasts suggest that by 2030 around 50 billion of these IoT devices will be in use around the world, creating a massive web of interconnected devices spanning everything from smartphones to kitchen appliances.” As the technologies powering these devices have become increasingly sophisticated, they have also become increasingly widespread, encompassing everything from toothbrushes and lightbulbs to cars, smart meters and medical equipment. 

- Moreover, it’s not just our homes and personal devices that are being reordered and reimagined in this connected age: it’s our workplaces, our health systems, our government, our bodies and our innermost thoughts that are being plugged into a matrix over which we have no real control. 

- The government, or “Party,” is headed by Big Brother, who appears on posters everywhere with the words: “Big Brother is watching you.”

- Tune in to find out the latest about health news, healing, politics, and the economy.A SPEECH BY jULIE PONESSE
Sins Of Omission: The AZT ScandalBy Celia FarberSpin Nov. 1989On a cold January day in 1987, inside one of the brightly-lit meeting rooms of the monstrous FDA building, a panel of 11 top Aids doctors pondered a very difficult decision. 

- The study that had brought the panel together had set the medical community abuzz. 

- Powerful, but unspecific, the drug was not selective in its cell destruction.Drug companies around the world were sifting through hundreds of compounds in the race to find a cure, or at least a treatment, for Aids. 

- Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was now pushing to expand prescription.The FDA's traditional concern had been thrown to the wind. 

- The toxicity, however stayed the same.The majority of those in the AIDS afflicted and medical communities held the drug up as the first breakthrough on AIDS. 

- Stock market analysts predict that Burroughs Wellcome may be selling as much as $2 billion worth of AZT, under the brand name Retrovir, each year by the mid-1990s - matching Burroughs Wellcome's total sales for all its products last year.AZT is the only antiretroviral drug that has received FDA approval for treatment of AIDS since the epidemic began 10 years ago, and the decision to approve it was based on a single study that has long been declared invalid.The study was intended to be a "double-blind placebo-controlled study," the only kind of study that can effectively prove whether or not a drug works. 

- The equation is simple and obvious: A drug must unquestionably repair more than it damages, otherwise the drug itself may cause more harm than the disease it is supposed to fight. 

- This kind of treatment could only theoretically help if you have a massive infection, which is not the case with AIDS. 

- The idea that the drug is "doing something," even though this is invariably followed with irritable admissions that there are "mechanisms about the drug and disease we don't understand," is desperately clung to. 

- Since there is a report in the Lancet [a leading British medical journal] that after 20 weeks or so, in many patients p24 came back, do you have any data on that? 

- It's slowing down the progression of the disease. 

- ""I am absolutely convinced that people enjoy a better quality of life and survive longer who do not take AZT," says Gene Fedorko, President of Health Education AIDS Liaison (HEAL). 

- There's also the so-called plague effect, the fact that people get stronger and stronger when a disease hits a population. 

- The overwhelming majority of AIDS patients die of PCP, for which there has been an effective treatment for decades. 

- ""If AIDS were not the popular disease that it is - the money-making and career-making machine - these people could not get away with that kind of shoddy science," says Bialy. 

- "August 17, 1989: The government has announced that 1.4 million healthy, HIV antibody-positive Americans could "benefit" from taking AZT, even though they show no symptoms of disease. 

- Every doctor and scientist I asked felt that it was highly unprofessional and reckless to announce a study with no data to look at, making recommendations with such drastic public health implications. 

- "I know dozens of people that I've seen personally every few months for several years now who have been in that state for more than five years, and have not progressed to any disease. 

- "When Duesberg heard the latest announcement, he was particularly stunned over the reaction of Gay Men's Health Crisis President Richard Dunne, who said that GMHC now urged "everybody to get tested," and of course those who test positive to go on AZT. 

- And they often prove costly in terms of their impact on health services and time taken in sick leave.Zinc has a key role in immunity, inflammation, tissue injury, blood pressure and in tissue responses to lack of oxygen.As a result, it has generated considerable interest during the current pandemic for the possible prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection.In response to calls for rapid evidence appraisals to inform self-care and clinical practice, the researchers evaluated zinc for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, and other viral respiratory tract infections.When that review was published, the results of several relevant clinical trials weren't yet available, so this current review brings the available evidence up to date.The review includes 28 clinical trials involving 5446 adults, published in 17 English and Chinese research databases up to August 2020. 

- None of the trials specifically looked at the use of zinc for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.The most common zinc formulations used were lozenges followed by nasal spraysand gels containing either zinc acetate or gluconate salts. 

- Doses varied substantially, depending on the formulation and whether zinc was used for prevention or treatment.Pooled analysis of the results of 25 trials showed that compared with dummy treatment (placebo), zinc lozenges or nasal spray prevented 5 respiratory tract infections in 100 people a month.These effects were strongest for curbing the risk of developing more severe symptoms, such as fever and influenza-like illnesses. 

- That might not work, says new studyUlrich John of University Medicine (Germany), November 2, 2021Increased mortality risk among current alcohol abstainers might largely be explained by other factors, including previous alcohol or drug problems, daily smoking, and overall poor health, according to a new study publishing November 2nd in PLOS Medicine by Ulrich John of University Medicine Greifswald, Germany, and colleagues.Previous studies have suggested that people who abstain from alcohol have a higher mortality rate than those who drink low to moderate amounts of alcohol. 

- Baseline data were available on alcohol drinking in the 12 months prior to the interview, as well as other information on health, alcohol and drug use. 

- Of these abstainers, 405 (90.60%) were former alcohol consumers and 322 (72.04%) had one or more other risk factor for higher mortality rates, including a former alcohol-use disorder or risky alcohol consumption (35.40%), daily smoking (50.00%), or fair to poor self-rated health (10.51%). 

- "The findings speak against recommendations to drink alcohol for health reasons. 

- "John adds, "It has long been assumed that low to moderate alcohol consumption might have positive effects on health based on the finding that alcohol abstainers seemed to die earlier than low to moderate drinkers. 

- We found that the majority of the abstainers had alcohol or drug problems, risky alcohol consumption, daily tobacco smoking or fair to poor health in their history, i.e., factors that predict early death.

- He has several recommendations.Tips for longevityWalking or other physical exercise is likely the best method to ensure brain and body health, Castel writes.In a large 2011 study, older adults were randomly assigned to a group that walked for 40 minutes three times a week or a stretching group for the same amount of time. 

- A good balance exercise is standing on one leg with your eyes open for 60 seconds or more, and then on the other leg. 

- Similarly, "walk four days a week with a friend" is a more useful goal than "get more exercise" and "call a friend or family member every Friday morning" is better than "maintain friendships. 

- Rates of loneliness among older adults are increasing and chronic loneliness "poses as large a risk to long-term health and longevity as smoking cigarettes and may be twice as harmful for retirees as obesity," Castel writes. 

- Some researchers believe this discomfort and frustration means you are challenging yourself in ways that will pay off in future brain and other health benefits.Research has shown that simply telling older adults they are taking a "wisdom test" rather than a "memory test" or "dementia screening" actually leads to better results on the identical memory test, Castel writes.If you are concerned about your memory, or that of a loved one, it may be wise to see a neurologist, Castel advises.Castel, 42, said he is struck by how many older adults vividly recall what is most important to them.As Castel quotes the Roman philosopher and statesman Cicero: "No old man forgets where he has hidden his treasure.

- "Recent reviews of scientific literature reveal that the vast majority of studies find evidence for an adverse association between screen-based media consumption and sleep health, primarily delayed bedtimes and reduced total sleep duration," said Orfeu Buxton, associate professor of biobehavioral health at Penn State and an author on the manuscript.The reasons behind this adverse association likely include time spent on screens replacing time spent sleeping; mental stimulation from media content; and the effects of light interrupting sleep cycles, according to the researchers.Buxton and other researchers are further exploring this topic. 

- They are working to understand if media use affects the timing and duration of sleep among children and adolescents; the role of parenting and family practices; the links between screen time and sleep quality and tiredness; and the influence of light on circadian physiology and sleep health among children and adolescents. 

- Supplementation with vitamins C and E associated with decreased risk of cognitive impairment, dementiaCHU de Québec Research Center, November 1, 2021.An article that appeared in the Annals of Pharmacotherapy reports an association between the intake of vitamin C and E supplements and a lower risk of developing cognitive decline among men and women aged 65 years and older.The current investigation included 5,269 men and women who were free of dementia upon enrollment in the Canadian Study of Health and Aging from 1991 to 1992. 

- Information concerning current use of prescription drugs and vitamins was ascertained from interview or questionnaire responses at the beginning of the study.Approximately 10% of the subjects reported using vitamin C or E. Over up to 11 years of follow up, 821 cases of all-cause dementia (including 560 Alzheimer’s disease cases) were diagnosed and 882 cases of cognitive impairment without dementia developed. 

- In comparison with those who did not report supplementing with either vitamin, the use of vitamin C and/or vitamin E was associated with a 38% lower adjusted risk of all-cause dementia and a 40% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. 

- For cognitive impairment without dementia, the risk was 23% lower among those who used either or both vitamins. 

- Evaluation of the effects of using either vitamin alone resulted in associations with similar risk reductions.“This study supports a protective role of vitamin E and C supplements in the risk for Alzheimer’s disease and all-cause dementia,” authors Luta L. Basambombo, MSc, of CHU de Québec Research Center and colleagues conclude. 

- “They provide some sense of the mechanisms of how these diets work, and that can lead to rational ideas on how we might mimic those situations for cancer therapy.”Widespread fast-food restaurants linked to higher rates of type 2 diabetesNew York University, November 1, 2021An increasing number of studies suggest a link between a neighborhood's built environment and the likelihood that its residents will develop chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and certain types of cancers. 

- "Most studies that examine the built food environment and its relationship to chronic diseases have been much smaller or conducted in localized areas," said Rania Kanchi, MPH, a researcher in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone and lead author of the study. 

- "How the study was conductedThe research team used data from the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (the largest single-payer healthcare system in the country) that captures more than 9 million veterans seen at more than 1,200 health facilities around the country. 

- Using this data, the researchers then constructed a national cohort of more than 4 million veterans without diabetes from the VA electronic health records (EHR) between 2008 and 2016. 

- Each veteran's health status was followed through 2018 or until the individual either developed diabetes, died, or had no appointments for more than two years.Within each of four distinct neighborhood types, the proportion of restaurants that were fast food, and the proportion of food outlets that were supermarkets were tabulated within a one-mile walk in high- density urban neighborhoods, a two-mile drive in low-density urban neighborhoods, a six-mile drive in suburban communities, and a 10-mile drive in rural communities.Veterans were followed for a median of five and a half years. 

- "The more we learn about the relationship between the food environment and chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, the more policymakers can act by improving the mix of healthy food options sold in restaurants and food outlets, or by creating better zoning laws that promote optimal food options for residents," said Lorna Thorpe, Ph.D., MPH, professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone and senior author of the study.One limitation of the study, according to the authors, is that the study may not be fully generalizable to non-veteran populations, as U.S. veterans tend to be predominantly male and have substantially greater health burdens and financial instability than the civilian population. 

- They plan to examine whether or not the relationships between fast-food restaurants, supermarkets and community types vary by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.Researchers have discovered neurons needed for acupuncture's anti-inflammatory responseHarvard Medical School, October November 1, 2021Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese technique that has been used for millennia to treat chronic pain and other health problems associated with inflammation, yet the scientific basis of the technique remains poorly understood.Now, a team of researchers led by neuroscientists at Harvard Medical School has elucidated the underlying neuroanatomy of acupuncture that activates a specific signaling pathway.In a study conducted in mice and published Oct. 13 in Nature, the team identified a subset of neurons that must be present for acupuncture to trigger an anti-inflammatory response via this signaling pathway.The scientists determined that these neurons occur only in a specific area of the hindlimb region—thus explaining why acupuncture in the hindlimb works, while acupuncture in the abdomen does not. 

- said lead investigator Qiufu Ma, HMS professor of neurobiology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.One area of particular interest to the research team is the so-called cytokine storm—the rapid release of large quantities of cytokines that frequently drives severe, systemic inflammation, and can be triggered by many things, including COVID-19, cancer treatment, or sepsis. 

- "This exuberant immune response is a major medical problem with a very high fatality rate of 15 percent to 30 percent," Ma said. 

- Even so, drugs to treat cytokine storm are lacking.Adapting an ancient technique to treat aberrant inflammationIn recent decades, acupuncture has been increasingly embraced in Western medicine as a potential treatment for inflammation.In this technique, acupoints on the body's surface are mechanically stimulated, triggering nerve signaling that affects the function of other parts of the body, including organs.In a 2014 study, researchers reported that electroacupuncture, a modern version of traditional acupuncture that uses electrical stimulation, could reduce cytokine storm in mice by activating the vagal-adrenal axis—a pathway wherein the vagus nervesignals the adrenal glands to release dopamine.In a study published in 2020, Ma and his team discovered that this electroacupuncture effect was region-specific: It was effective when given in the hindlimb region, but did not have an effect when administered in the abdominal region. 

- Another area of need, he added, is excessive immune reactions that can be a side effect of cancer immunotherapy.Ma hopes that his research will ultimately advance scientific understanding of acupuncture and provide practical information that can be used to improve and refine the technique.Happy childhood memories linked to better health later in lifeMichigan State University, November 5, 2018People who have fond memories of childhood, specifically their relationships with their parents, tend to have better health, less depression and fewer chronic illnesses as older adults, according to research published by the American Psychological Association. 

- "We found that good memories seem to have a positive effect on health and well-being, possibly through the ways that they reduce stress or help us maintain healthy choices in life. 

- "The findings were published in the journal Health Psychology.Previous research has shown a positive relationship between good memories and good health in young adults, including higher quality of work and personal relationships, lower substance use, lower depression and fewer health problems, according to Chopik. 

- Chopik and Edelstein sought to expand on the existing studies to include participants' reflections of their relationships with both parents.The researchers used data from two nationally representative samples, the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States and the Health and Retirement Study, with a total of more than 22,000 participants. 

- The surveys included questions about perceptions of parental affection, overall health, chronic conditions and depressive symptoms.Participants in both groups who reported remembering higher levels of affection from their mothers in early childhood experienced better physical health and fewer depressive symptoms later in life. 

- One might expect childhood memories to matter less and less over time, but these memories still predicted better physical and mental health when people were in middle age and older adulthood," said Chopik.There was a stronger association in people who reported a more loving relationship with their mothers, noted Chopik, but that might change. 

- Miller co-authored the paper, along with his colleagues in the Department of Psychology and the Emory Behavioral Immunology Program, where he serves as director.Miller says novel treatment strategies to break this vicious cycle are currently under development. 

- He and his colleagues raise the possibility of developing treatments specifically for the motivational deficits caused by inflammation, thus moving to a much more targeted approach to therapeutic development in psychiatry, as now seen in the oncology field, versus the current use of outdated and non-specific diagnostic categories of psychiatric disease such as "depression.

- Therefore I was perplexed that you would defend the very institutional structures, which have betrayed us repeatedly in history, that you have made a career to challenge.My own background is in human nutritional health and science. 

- I have counseled tens of thousands of people and conducted over 50 clinical studies related to chronic illnesses and health.When Anthony Fauci and other federal health officials began making very misleading statements about Covid-19, which independent reviews have found to be based on very shoddy scientific research and analysis, it drew my attention. 

- Over 100,000 physicians and medical researchers worldwide, including one of the inventors of mRNA vaccine technology Dr. Robert Malone, are formally challenging the official narrative about the efficacy and safety of these experimental vaccines. 

- These doctors therefore are adhering to the precautionary principle, which has been upheld as a gold standard for questionable medical intervention before the pandemic. 

- Medical professionals are risking their reputations to now warn that more children will die from these vaccines than from a SARS-2 infection. 

- Recently in Europe, a suit has been filed by 1,000 attorneys and 10,000 medical professionals against the World Health Organization, the CDC and the World Economic Forum based upon the Nuremberg Code criteria. 

- Another lawsuit is underway in the US against the CDC and Fauci's National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Disease for manipulating and massaging the data in the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to reduce the evidence that the vaccines are causing enormous injuries and deaths. 

- It is a classic example of "manufacturing consent" to implement a narrative that is grossly compromised by commercial and perhaps political interests.So I would encourage you to please examine the literature and articles carefully and reflect upon the facts that are being intentionally ignored and denied by our health officials and by the media. 

- However, perhaps not on the matter of medical science and immunology.I appreciate your considerationSincerely yoursGary Null, PhD

- Eating leafy greens could help prevent macular degenerationWestmead Institute for Medical Research (Australia), October 13, 2021A new study has shown that eating vegetable nitrates, found mainly in green leafy vegetables and beetroot, could help reduce your risk of developing early-stage age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Researchers at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research interviewed more than 2,000 Australian adults aged over 49 and followed them over a 15-year period.The research showed that people who ate between 100 to 142 mgs of vegetable nitrates each day had a 35% lower risk of developing early AMD than people who ate less than 69mgs of vegetable nitrates each day.Lead Researcher Associate Professor Bamini Gopinath from the Westmead Institute and the University of Sydney said the link between vegetable nitrates and macular degeneration could have important implications. 

- It also did not show any significant connections between vegetable nitrates and late stage AMD, or between non-vegetable nitrates and AMD risk.One in seven Australians over 50 have some signs of macular degeneration.Age is the strongest known risk factor and the disease is more likely to occur after the age of 50.There is currently no cure for the disease.The research compiled data from the Blue Mountains Eye Study, a benchmark population-based study that started in 1992.It is one of the world's largest epidemiology studies, measuring diet and lifestyle factors against health outcomes and a range of chronic diseases. 

- "Our research aims to understand why eye diseases occur, as well as the genetic and environmental conditions that may threaten vision," Associate Professor Gopinath concluded.Research review shows intermittent fasting works for weight loss, health changesUniversity of Illinois Chicago, October 13, 2021Intermittent fasting can produce clinically significant weight loss as well as improve metabolic health in individuals with obesity, according to a new study review led by University of Illinois Chicago researchers. 

- "We noted that intermittent fasting is not better than regular dieting; both produce the same amount of weight loss and similar changes in blood pressure, cholesterol and inflammation," said Krista Varady, professor of nutrition at the UIC College of Applied Health Sciences and author of "Cardiometabolic Benefits of Intermittent Fasting. 

- "According to the analysis published in the Annual Review of Nutrition, all forms of fasting reviewed produced mild to moderate weight loss, 1 percent to 8 percent from baseline weight, which represents results that are similar to that of more traditional, calorie-restrictive diets. 

- Intermittent fasting regimens may also benefit health by decreasing blood pressure and insulin resistance, and in some cases, cholesterol and triglyceride levels are also lowered. 

- Other health benefits, such as improved appetite regulation and positive changes in the gut microbiome, have also been demonstrated.The review looked at over 25 research studies involving three types of intermittent fasting:Alternate day fasting, which typically involves a feast day alternated with a fast day where 500 calories are consumed in one meal.5:2 diet, a modified version of alternate day fasting that involves five feast days and two fast days per week.Time-restricted eating, which confines eating to a specified number of hours per day, usually four to 10 hours, with no calorie restrictions during the eating period.Various studies of time-restricted eating show participants with obesity losing an average of 3 percent of their body weight, regardless of the time of the eating window.Studies showed alternate day fasting resulted in weight loss of 3 percent to 8 percent of body weight over three to eight weeks, with results peaking at 12 weeks. 

- Increased water intake can help alleviate headaches caused by dehydration during this time.Exercise—Moderate to high-intensity endurance or resistance training during food abstention can be done, and some study participants reported having more energy on fast days. 

- However, studies recommend those following alternate day fasting eat their fasting day meal after exercise.Diet during fasting—There are no specific recommendations for food consumption during intermittent fasting, but eating fruits, vegetables and whole grains can help boost fiber intake and help relieve constipation that sometimes accompanies fasting.Alcohol and caffeine—For those using an alternate day or 5:2 fasting plan, alcohol is not recommended on fast days as the limited calories should be used on healthy foods that provide nutrition.There are several groups who should not intermittent fast, according to the studies. 

- You can also combine it with other diets, like Keto," Varady said.Varady has recently been awarded a National Institutes of Health grant to study time-restricted eating for 12 months to see if it works long term.Antioxidants to prevent Alzheimer's diseaseA balanced intake of antioxidants could prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease.Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (France), October 13, 2021Research conducted by the Ph.D student Mohamed Raâfet Ben Khedher and the postdoctoral researcher Mohamed Haddad of the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS) has shown that an oxidation-antioxidant imbalance in the blood is an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease, rather than a consequence. 

- This breakthrough made by researchers under the supervision of the Professor Charles Ramassamy provides an avenue for preventive intervention: the antioxidants intake.The research team showed that oxidative markers, known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease, show an increase up to five years before the onset of the disease. 

- The results of this study, published in the Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring (DADM) journal, suggest that oxidation may be an early marker of this disease that affects more than 500,000 Canadians.“Given that there is an increase in oxidative stress in people who develop the disease, we may regulate the antioxidant systems. 

- For example, we could modulate the antioxidant systems, such as apolipoproteins J and D, which transport lipids and cholesterol in the blood and play an important role in brain function and Alzheimer's disease. 

- Another avenue would be to increase the intake of antioxidants through nutrition”, says Professor Ramassamy.Accessible biomarkersUnlike the current set of invasive and expensive tests used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease, the oxidative markers discovered by Professor Ramassamy's research team can be detected by a blood test. 

- These markers are found in plasma extracellular vesicles, which are pockets released by all cells in the body, including those in the brain.The research team focused specifically on the "sporadic" Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of the disease which results primarily from the presence of the APOE4 susceptibility gene. 

- This same form of the disease had been studied by the team for other early markers.“By identifying oxidative markers in the blood of individuals at risk five years before the onset of the disease, we could make recommendations to slow the onset of the disease and limit the risks”, scientists noted.This breakthrough brings new hope to Alzheimer's research. 

- Once the disease is symptomatic, it is difficult, if not impossible, to reverse it.Meditation training reduces long-term stress, according to hair analysisMax Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (Germany), October 11, 2021Mental training that promotes skills such as mindfulness, gratitude or compassion reduces the concentration of the stress hormone cortisol in hair. 

- This condition not only puts a strain on the well-being of those affected, but it is also linked to a number of physiological diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and psychological disorders such as depression, one of the world's leading causes of disease burden (Global Burden of Disease Study, 2017).Therefore, effective methods are being sought to reduce everyday stress in the long term. 

- "We assume that different training aspects are particularly helpful for these different forms of stress," says Veronika Engert, head of the research group "Social Stress and Family Health" at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences. 

- "Study: Moderate carbohydrate intake is a cardiovascular benefit for womenMonash University (Australia), October 13, 2021Women's heart health has been the focus of a recent study by Monash University, with researchers finding that proportional carbohydrate intake and not saturated fat was significantly associated with cardiovascular disease benefit in Australian women.Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women. 

- No significant relationship was demonstrated between proportional carbohydrate intake and all-cause mortality.In addition, increasing proportional saturated fat intake was not associated with cardiovascular disease or mortality in women; rather, increasing saturated fat intakecorrelated with lower odds of developing diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity.The findings are now published in the British Medical Journal.The results contradict much of the historical epidemiological research that supported a link between saturated fat and CVD. 

- "The Heart Foundation, which is one of the study's funders, welcomed the focus on women and CVD, which has historically been under-researched.Heart Foundation manager, food and nutrition, Eithne Cahill, cautioned that "not all carbohydrates are created equal. 

- ""We know that quality carbohydrate foods such as vegetables and whole grains—including whole grain bread, cereals, and pasta—are beneficial for heart health, whereas poor quality carbohydrates such as white bread, biscuits, cakes, and pastries can increase risk," she said. 

- "Similarly, different fats have different effects on heart health. 

- This research comes from the same group that found ONA suppressed pro-tumor activation of host myeloid cells.According to a 2014 review of cancer medicines from the World Health Organization, EOC is the most common type of ovarian cancer and has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 40%. 

- It has a relatively low lifetime risk that is less than 1%, but that can increase up to 40% if there is a family history of the disease. 

- A majority of patients (80%) experience a relapse after their initial treatment with chemotherapy, therefore a more effective line of treatment is needed.Kumamoto University researchers found that ONA has several effects on EOC. 

- With a little more testing, an oral ONA supplement should greatly benefit cancer patients.Risk of chronic diseases caused by exogenous chemical residuesDalian Institute of Chemical Physics (China), October 13, 2021Chronic diseases are main killers affecting the health of human. 

- The morbidities of major chronic diseases such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperuricemia and dyslipidemia are as high as 10% to 30%, showing a gradually upward trend as well.More and more studies have shown that environmental pollution is a major health risk factor that cannot be ignored. 

- Researchers from National Institute for Nutrition and Health of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology were also involved in this study.The researchers discovered positive associations of serum perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) with hyperuricemia, and revealed the mechanism of the relationship between the exogenous chemical residues in the serum and the risk of chronic diseases at the metabolic level.The researchers investigated the relationship between 106 exogenous chemical residues and five chronic diseases in 496 serum samples. 

- Lipid species including glycerophospholipids and glycerides presented the strongest correlation with exposure and disease, which were not only positively related to PFASs exposure but also the risk factor for hyperuricemia. 

- "We also found that key mediation metabolites mediated 25% to 68% of the exposure-disease risk relationship," Prof. Xu added.This study provides in-depth etiological understanding for the occurrence and development of diseases, which may be helpful for the early detection of the disease and the identification of early warning markers.

- The Government Assault Against Ivermectin and other Safe SARS-2 TreatmentsRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, September 1, 2021Had the FDA and Anthony Fauci’s National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease (NIAID) started approving existing clinically-proven and inexpensive drugs for treating malaria, parasites and other pathogens at the start of the pandemic, millions of people would have been saved from experiencing serious infections or dying from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 

- Why federal health officials never followed this strategy is a question the mainstream media refuses to ask.Another question that the medical establishment, let alone our compliant media, is why have they failed to ask whether there are reliable studies in the peer-reviewed literature and testimonies from thousands of day-to-day clinical physicians worldwide who treat Covid-19 patients with these drugs, in particular hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Ivermectin. 

- However, in the US, Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, the FDA and our federal medical officials have categorically denied their use. 

- It may be noted that various organizations and agencies in other nations, such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority in South Africa, which have banned ivermectin, are often funded by Gates. 

- It is naïve to believe that Gates has any philanthropic intentions whatsoever to see a highly effective treatment for SARS-2 infections reach worldwide approval. 

- Remdesivir’s average effectiveness for late stage treatment is only 22 percent. 

- A Chinese study published in The Lancet found no statistically significant benefit in the drug and 12 percent of participants taking the drug had to discontinue treatment due to serious adverse effects, especially liver and kidney damage.When questions are posited as a general argument for advocating expedient measures to protect public health during this pandemic, would it not have been wise to have prioritized for emergency use HCQ, Ivermectin, and other remedies with a record of curtailing Covid, such as the antibiotic azithromycin, zinc, selenium, Vitamins C and D, and melatonin as a first line of defense? 

- But this is what Fauci and Trump, and now Biden, permitted to happen.If this strategy of medical intervention had been followed, would it have been successful? 

- Yet those American physicians struggling to get this urgent message out to federal health officials are being marginalized and ridiculed en masse. 

- The World Health Organization recommends Ivermectin for Covid-19 so why not the US and these other nations? 

- Under oath, multiple physicians and professors at American medical schools have testified before Congress to present the scientific evidence supporting HCQ and Ivermectin. 

- These are otherwise medical professionals at the very heart of treating Covid-19 patients.Today, American journalism is in shambles. 

- Whether it is CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the liberal tabloid Daily Beast, NPR or PBS, each has unlimited resources to properly investigate the federal and institutional machinery behind the government health policies being thrust upon us. 

- Yet no mainstream journalist has found the moral compass to bring this truth to the public.In the meantime, we are allowing millions to die, and countless others to be seriously affected from a severe infection because of professional medical neglect and a healthcare system favoring the pharmaceutical industry’s frantic rush to develop expensive novel drugs and experimental vaccines. 

- Worldwide, it is not unreasonable to claim that billions of people have been treated with these drugs.Below is a breakdown of the studies conducted so far for HCQ, Ivermectin and Vitamin D specifically for combatting the SARS-CoV-2 virusHydroxychloroquine344 studies, 250 peer-reviewed have been conducted specifically for Covid-19281 have been clinical trials that involved 4,583 scientists and over 407,627 patients64% improvement in 31 early treatment trials75% improvement in 13 early stage infection treatment mortality results21% improvement in 190 late stage infection treatment trials (patients in serious condition)23% improvement in 44 randomized controlled trialsFull list of HCQ studies and details:  https://c19hcq.comIvermectin131 studies, 52 peer-reviewed have been conducted specifically for Covid-1963 have been clinical trials that involved 613 scientists and over 26,398 patients58% improvement in 31 randomized controlled trials86% improvement in 14 prophylaxis trials72% improvement in 27 early stage infection treatment trials40% improvement in 22 late stage infection treatment trials58% improvement in 25 mortality resultsFull list of Ivermectin studies and details:  https://c19ivermectin.comOther inexpensive repurposed drugs for treating SARS-2Fluvoxamine88% improvement in early treatment29% improvement in late stage treatment63% improvement in all 7 peer-reviewed studiesVitamin D101 studies conducted by over 875 scientists63 sufficiency studies with 34,863 patients33 treatment trials with 46,860 patients42% improvement in 33 treatment trials56% improvement in 68 sufficiency studies55% improvement in 19 treatment mortality resultsFull list of Vitamin D studies and details:  https://c19vitamind.comIn contrast there have been 21 studies enrolling 35,744 patients in Remdesivir trials showing only a 22% improvement in all studies combined.

Can low temperature-aged garlic enhance exercise performance?Korea Univesity & National Institute of Agricultural Sciences (South Korea), October 8, 2021Scientists from South Korea’s National Institute of Agricultural Sciences and Korea University looked at aged garlic to see whether it could help reduce fatigue. 

- One of these control groups was made to exercise while the other group was not.The mice in the five groups were forced to run on a treadmill for four weeks. 

- With each passing week, the amount of exercise the mice would have to do on the treadmills would increase. 

- )After 28 days of treatment, five mice from each group were subjected to a final, exhaustive treadmill test. 

- Following the final exercise, the mice were killed and blood samples were collected from them. 

- More importantly, the LTAG treated mice had increased amounts of glycogen and creatine kinase (CK) in their muscles.Glycogen storage is an important source of energy during exercise.

- Treatment with intravenous iron improved symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency enrolled in the FAIR-HF trial.2 Based on these results, the FAIR-HF 2 trial is investigating the impact of intravenous iron supplementation on the risk of death in patients with heart failure.The current study aimed to examine whether the association between iron deficiency and outcomes was also observed in the general population.The study included 12,164 individuals from three European population-based cohorts. 

- The functional definition is more accurate as it includes both measures and picks up those with sufficient stores but not enough in circulation for the body to work properly.”Participants were followed up for incident coronary heart disease and stroke, death due to cardiovascular disease, and all-cause death. 

- The researchers analysed the association between iron deficiency and incident coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality after adjustments for age, sex, smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, body mass index, and inflammation. 

- Participants with a history of coronary heart disease or stroke at baseline were excluded from the incident disease analyses.At baseline, 60% of participants had absolute iron deficiency and 64% had functional iron deficiency. 

- Incidence coronary heart disease and stroke were diagnosed in 1,033 (8.5%) and 766 (6.3%) participants, respectively.Functional iron deficiency was associated with a 24% higher risk of coronary heart disease, 26% raised risk of cardiovascular mortality, and 12% increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with no functional iron deficiency. 

- Absolute iron deficiency was associated with a 20% raised risk of coronary heart disease compared with no absolute iron deficiency, but was not linked with mortality. 

- Within a 10-year period, 5.4% of all deaths, 11.7% of cardiovascular deaths, and 10.7% of new coronary heart disease diagnoses were attributable to functional iron deficiency.“This analysis suggests that if iron deficiency had been absent at baseline, about 5% of deaths, 12% of cardiovascular deaths, and 11% of new coronary heart disease diagnoses would not have occurred in the following decade,” said Dr. Schrage.“The study showed that iron deficiency was highly prevalent in this middle-aged population, with nearly two-thirds having functional iron deficiency,” said Dr. Schrage. 

- “These individuals were more likely to develop heart disease and were also more likely to die during the next 13 years.”Dr. 

- Hence, there is a need for more novel treatment alternatives and options. 

- The study was published in the journal Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice.Earlier studies have reported the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating insulin resistance and related conditions.The review looked at acupuncture and its effects on clinical outcomes.The researchers searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials involving insulin resistance patients treated with acupuncture:Cochrane Central Register of Controlled TrialsEmbaseMedline (via OVID)China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)Wan Fang and China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP)The studies show that homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance significantly decreased with acupuncture treatment.Other significant decreases include fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose and fasting insulin.Acupuncture increased insulin sensitivity with very few adverse effects.In sum, acupuncture is a safe and effective alternative treatment for insulin resistance.Blueberries may improve attention in children following double-blind trialUniversity of Reading (UK), October 10, 2021Primary school children could show better attention by consuming flavonoid-rich blueberries, following a study conducted by the University of Reading.In a paper published in Food & Function, a group of 7-10 year olds who consumed a drink containing wild blueberries or a matched placebo and were tested on their speed and accuracy in completing an executive task function on a computer.The double blind trial found that the children who consumed the flavonoid-rich blueberry drink had 9% quicker reaction times on the test without any sacrifice of accuracy. 

- They have been associated with a range of health benefits including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and our latest findings continue to show that there is a beneficial cognitive effect of consuming fruit and vegetables, tea, coffee and even dark chocolate which all contain flavonoids. 

- The task was a simple one- responding to the direction of an arrow in the middle of a screen (by pressing left/right arrow key) but we then varied how quickly the stimuli appeared, whether there was additional arrows appearing either side of the stimuli and whether those flanking arrows were pointing in the same/different direction as they direction you had to respond.There are 6 main classes of flavonoids:Anthocyanins – found in berry fruits such as the blueberries used in this study and also in red wine.Flavonols - found in onions, leeks, and broccoliFlavones - found in parsley and celery,Isoflavones - found in soy and soy products,Flavanones - found in citrus fruit and tomatoesFlavanols—found in green tea, red wine, and chocolateNocebo effect: Does a drug's high price tag cause its own side effects?University Medical Center Hamburg (Germany), October 5, 2021Pricey drugs may make people more vulnerable to perceiving side effects, a new study suggests—and the phenomenon is not just "in their heads. 

- It's the negative version of the well-known placebo effect, where people feel better after receiving a therapy because they expected good things.With the nocebo effect, patients' worries over treatment side effects make them feel sick.In this study, researchers found that people were more likely to report painful side effects from a fake drug when told it was expensive.But it wasn't just something people were "making up." 

- She is with the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, in Germany.Dr. 

- "Expectations do modulate symptoms and patients' responses to treatment," she said.For the study, Tinnermann's team recruited 49 healthy volunteers and randomly assigned them to test one of two itch-relieving "medical creams. 

- Doctors could, for instance, inform patients that drug prices or other factors can sway their expectations about a treatment's benefits and risks—and that, in turn, can influence whether they feel better or develop side effects.There is, however, no research into whether that kind of knowledge helps prevent patients from the nocebo effect, Tinnermann said.But, she added, health professionals can be aware that patients' expectations "play a huge role in medicine"—and be mindful of how they talk about a medication and its possible side effects.It's an important matter, Colloca said, because the nocebo effect can cause people to stop taking needed medications.Colloca pointed to the example of cholesterol-lowering statins.The potential for those medications to cause muscle pain has been widely reported. 

- "We hope that the findings from this study can help guide the design of future clinical trials," Dr Shay stated.In another study, Barbara Shukitt-Hale, PhD, and her associates at Tufts University's Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging gave 19 month old rats a control diet or a diet enhanced with raspberry extract for 11 weeks. 

- While both treated and untreated muscles displayed a reduction in the amount of damaged muscle fibers, the reduction was more pronounced and the cross-sectional area of the fibers was larger in the treated muscle, indicating that treatment had led to greater repair and strength recovery. 

- The greater the force applied during treatment, the stronger the injured muscles became, confirming that mechanotherapy improves muscle recovery after injury. 

- "Neutrophils are known to kill and clear out pathogens and damaged tissue, but in this study we identified their direct impacts on muscle progenitor cell behaviors," said co-second author Stephanie McNamara, a former Post-Graduate Fellow at the Wyss Institute who is now an M.D.-Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School (HMS). 

- "These findings are remarkable because they indicate that we can influence the function of the body's immune system in a drug-free, non-invasive way," said Walsh, who is also the Paul A. Maeder Professor of Engineering and Applied Science at SEAS and whose group is experienced in developing wearable technology for diagnosing and treating disease. 

- "The fields of mechanotherapy and immunotherapy rarely interact with each other, but this work is a testament to how crucial it is to consider both physical and biological elements when studying and working to improve human health," said Mooney, who is the corresponding author of the paper and the Robert P. Pinkas Family Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS. 

- Light smokers who engaged in leisure time exercise had a 69% lower risk compared with unsupplemented members of this subgroup. 

- This phenomenon is likely the driving factor behind most, if not all, diseases that affect brain function, as well as the natural breakdown of brain cells seen in aging, researchers say.Previous research has pointed to astrocytes—a star-shaped glial cell of the central nervous system—as the culprits behind cell death seen in Parkinson's disease and dementia, among other neurodegenerative diseases. 

- "Our findings show that the toxic fatty acids produced by astrocytes play a critical role in brain cell death and provide a promising new target for treating, and perhaps even preventing, many neurodegenerative diseases," says study co-senior author Shane Liddelow, Ph.D.Liddelow, an assistant professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Physiology at NYU Langone Health, adds that targeting these fats instead of the cells that produce them may be a safer approach to treating neurodegenerative diseasesbecause astrocytes feed nerve cells and clear away their waste. 

- He notes that while healthy cells are not harmed by the toxins, neurons become susceptible to the damaging effects when they are injured, mutated, or infected by prions, the contagious, misfolded proteins that play a major role in mad cow disease and similar illnesses. 

- Liddelow and his colleagues had previously shown these neurotoxic astrocytes in the brains of patients with Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis, among other diseases.Clinical trial for nicotinamide riboside: Vitamin safely boosts levels of important cell metabolite linked to multiple health benefitsUniversity of Iowa Health Care, October 3, 2021In the first controlled clinical trial of nicotinamide riboside (NR), a newly discovered form of Vitamin B3, researchers have shown that the compound is safe for humans and increases levels of a cell metabolite that is critical for cellular energy production and protection against stress and DNA damage.Studies in mice have shown that boosting the levels of this cell metabolite -- known as NAD+ -- can produce multiple health benefits, including resistance to weight gain, improved control of blood sugar and cholesterol, reduced nerve damage, and longer lifespan. 

- Levels of NAD+ diminish with age, and it has been suggested that loss of this metabolite may play a role in age-related health decline.These findings in animal studies have spurred people to take commercially available NR supplements designed to boost NAD+. 

- Because the levels of supplementation in mice that produce beneficial effects are achievable in people, it appears than health benefits of NR will be translatable to humans safely. 

- "The next step will be to study the effect of longer duration NR supplementation on NAD+ metabolism in healthy adults, but Brenner also has plans to test the effects of NR in people with diseases and health conditions, including elevated cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, and people at risk for chemotherapeutic peripheral neuropathy.Prior to the formal clinical trial, Brenner conducted a pilot human study -- on himself. 

- More than a decade of research on NR metabolic pathways and health effects in mice and rats had convinced him that NR supplementation had real promise to improve human health and wellness. 

- The experiments also revealed more detail about NAD+ metabolic pathways.In particular, the researchers compared the ability of all three NAD+ precursor vitamins -- NR, niacin, and nicotinamide -- to boost NAD+ metabolism and stimulate the activity of certain enzymes, which have been linked to longevity and healthbenefits. 

- "Now that we have demonstrated safety in this small clinical trial, we are in a position to find out if the health benefits that we have seen in animals can be reproduced in people," says Brenner, who also is co-director of the Obesity Research and Education Initiative, professor of internal medicine, and a member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles Diabetes Research Center at the UI.Protecting the ozone layer is delivering vast health benefitsMontreal Protocol will spare Americans from 443 million skin cancer casesNational Center for Atmospheric Research, October 7, 2021An international agreement to protect the ozone layer is expected to prevent 443 million cases of skin cancer and 63 million cataract cases for people born in the United States through the end of this century, according to new research.The research team, by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), ICF Consulting, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), focused on the far-reaching impacts of a landmark 1987 treaty known as the Montreal Protocol and later amendments that substantially strengthened it. 

- The modeling revealed the treaty’s effect on stratospheric ozone, the associated reductions in ultraviolet radiation, and the resulting health benefits.In addition to the number of skin cancer and cataract cases that were avoided, the study also showed that the treaty, as most recently amended, will prevent approximately 2.3 million skin cancer deaths in the U.S.“It’s very encouraging,” said NCAR scientist Julia Lee-Taylor, a co-author of the study. 

- The amendments were based on Input from the scientific community, including a number of NCAR scientists, that were summarized in quadrennial Ozone Assessment reports.To quantify the impacts of the treaty, the research team built a model known as the Atmospheric and Health Effects Framework. 

- This model, which draws on various data sources about ozone, public health, and population demographics, consists of five computational steps. 

- These simulate past and future emissions of ozone-destroying substances, the impacts of those substances on stratospheric ozone, the resulting changes in ground-level UV radiation, the U.S. population’s exposure to UV radiation, and the incidence and mortality of health effects resulting from the exposure.The results showed UV radiation levels returning to 1980 levels by the mid-2040s under the amended treaty. 

- Those born between 1900 and 2040 experience heightened cases of skin cancer and cataracts, with the worst health outcomes affecting those born between about 1950 and 2000.However, the health impacts would have been far more severe without the treaty, with cases of skin cancer and cataracts rising at an increasingly rapid rate through the century.“We peeled away from disaster,” Lee-Taylor said. 

- After that, our calculations for the health impacts start to break down because we’re getting so far into conditions that have never been seen before.”The research team also found that more than half the treaty’s health benefits could be traced to the later amendments rather than the original 1987 Montreal Protocol. 

- Overall, the treaty prevented more than 99% of potential health impacts that would have otherwise occurred from ozone destruction. 

- This showed the importance of the treaty’s flexibility in adjusting to evolving scientific knowledge, the authors said.The researchers focused on the U.S. because of ready access to health data and population projections. 

- Lee-Taylor said that the specific health outcomes in other countries may vary, but the overall trends would be similar.“The treaty had broad global benefits,” she said.What is Boron?The trace mineral boron provides profound anti-cancer effects, in addition to maintaining stronger bones.Life Extension, September 2021Boron is a trace mineral found in the earth’s crust and in water. 

- Its importance in human health has been underestimated.Boron has been shown to have actions against specific types of malignancies, such as:Cervical cancer: The country Turkey has an extremely low incidence of cervical cancer, and scientists partially attribute this to its boron-rich soil.1 When comparing women who live in boron-rich regions versus boron-poor regions of Turkey, not a single woman living in the boron-rich regions had any indication of cervical cancer.2(The mean dietary intake of boron for women in this group was 8.41 mg/day.) 

- In one study, when mice were exposed to boric acid, their tumors shrank by as much as 38%.6 One analysis found that increased dietary boron intake was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer.7Several human and animal studies have confirmed the important connection between boron and bone health.Boron prevents calcium loss,8 while also alleviating the bone problems associated with magnesium and vitamin D deficiency.9 All of these nutrients help maintain bone density.A study in female rats revealed the harmful effects a deficiency in boron has on bones, including:10Decreased bone volume fraction, a measure of bone strength,Decreased thickness of the bone’s spongy inner layer, andDecreased maximum force needed to break the femur.And in a study of post-menopausal women, supplementation with3 mg of boron per day prevented calcium loss and bone demineralization by reducing urinary excretion of both calcium and magnesium.8In addition to its bone and anti-cancer benefits, there are nine additional reasons boron is an important trace mineral vital for health and longevity. 

- Natural compound in basil may protect against Alzheimer's disease pathologyUniversity of South Florida, October 5, 2021Fenchol, a natural compound abundant in some plants including basil, can help protect the brain against Alzheimer's disease pathology, a preclinical study led by University of South Florida Health (USF Health) researchers suggests.The new study published Oct. 5 in the Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, discovered a sensing mechanism associated with the gut microbiome that explains how fenchol reduces neurotoxicity in the Alzheimer's brain.Emerging evidence indicates that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)– metabolites produced by beneficial gut bacteria and the primary source of nutrition for cells in your colon—contribute to brain health. 

- The abundance of SCFAs is often reduced in older patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. 

- However, how this decline in SCFAs contributes to Alzheimer's disease progression remains largely unknown.Gut-derived SCFAs that travel through the blood to the brain can bind to and activate free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), a cell signaling molecule expressed on brain cellscalled neurons. 

- "Our study is the first to discover that stimulation of the FFAR2 sensing mechanism by these microbial metabolites (SCFAs) can be beneficial in protecting brain cells against toxic accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein associated with Alzheimer's disease," said principal investigator Hariom Yadav, Ph.D., professor of neurosurgery and brain repair at the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine, where he directs the USF Center for Microbiome Research.One of the two hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's disease is hardened deposits of Aβ that clump together between nerve cells to form amyloid protein plaques in the brain. 

- These pathologies contribute to the neuron loss and death that ultimately cause the onset of Alzheimer's, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of memory, thinking skills and other cognitive abilities.Dr. 

- Yadav and his collaborators delve into molecular mechanisms to explain how interactions between the gut microbiome and the brain might influence brain health and age-related cognitive decline. 

- In this study, Dr. Yadav said, the research team set out to uncover the "previously unknown" function of FFAR2 in the brain.The researchers first showed that inhibiting the FFAR2 receptor (thus blocking its ability to "sense" SCFAs in the environment outside the neuronal cell and transmit signaling inside the cell) contributes to the abnormal buildup of the Aβ protein causing neurotoxicity linked to Alzheimer's disease.Then, they performed large-scale virtual screening of more than 144,000 natural compounds to find potential candidates that could mimic the same beneficial effect of microbiota produced SCFAs in activating FFAR2 signaling. 

- Fenchol, a plant-derived compound that gives basil its aromatic scent, was best at binding to the FFAR's active site to stimulate its signaling.Further experiments in human neuronal cell cultures, as well as Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans (worm) and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease demonstrated that fenchol significantly reduced excess Aβ accumulation and death of neurons by stimulating FFAR2 signaling, the microbiome sensing mechanism. 

- When the researchers more closely examined how fenchol modulates Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, they found that the compound decreased senescent neuronal cells, also known as "zombie" cells, commonly found in brains with Alzheimer's disease pathology.Zombie cells stop replicating and die a slow death. 

- "Before you start throwing lots of extra basil in your spaghetti sauce or anything else you eat to help stave off dementia, more research is needed—including in humans.In exploring fenchol as a possible approach for treating or preventing Alzheimer's pathology, the USF Health team will seek answers to several questions. 

- We were interested in whether purpose was also associated with the quality of memories of important personal experiences because such qualities may be one reason why purpose is associated with better mental and physical health. 

- Researchers then measured participants' ability to retrieve and describe personal memories about the pandemic in July 2020, several months into the public health crisis.Participants with a stronger sense of purpose in life reported that their memories were more accessible, coherent and vivid than participants with less purpose. 

- "We chose to measure the ability to recall memories associated with the COVID-19 pandemic because the pandemic is an event that touched everyone, but there has been a wide range of experiences and reactions to it that should be apparent in memories," said co-author Martina Luchetti, an assistant professor in the College of Medicine.Along with the association with better memory, previous research has found other numerous benefits connected with having a sense of purpose, from a lower risk of death to better physical and mental health. 

- "Memories help people to sustain their well-being, social connections and cognitive health," said co-author Antonio Terracciano, a professor in the College of Medicine. 

- Asthma deaths arise primarily during episodes of acute worsening of symptoms, known as attacks or 'exacerbations', which are commonly triggered by viral upper respiratory infections.Vitamin D is thought to protect against such attacks by boosting immune responses to respiratory viruses and dampening down harmful airway inflammation.The new study, funded by the National Institute for Health Research, and published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, collated and analysed the individual data from 955 participants in seven randomised controlled trials, which tested the use of vitamin D supplements.Overall, the researchers found that vitamin D supplementation resulted in:a 30 per cent reduction in the rate of asthma attacks requiring treatment with steroid tablets or injections - from 0.43 events per person per year to 0.30.a 50 per cent reduction in the risk of experiencing at least one asthma attack requiring Accident and Emergency Department attendance and/or hospitalisation - from 6 per cent of people experiencing such an event to 3 per cent.Vitamin D supplementation was found to be safe at the doses administered. 

- No instances of excessively high calcium levels or renal stones were seen, and serious adverse events were evenly distributed between participants taking vitamin D and those on placebo.Lead researcher Professor Adrian Martineau said: "These results add to the ever growing body of evidence that vitamin D can support immune function as well as bone health. 

- These participants saw a 55 per cent reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with steroid tablets or injections - from 0.42 events per person per year to 0.19.However, due to relatively small numbers of patients within sub-groups, the researchers caution that they did not find definitive evidence to show that effects of vitamin D supplementation differ according to baseline vitamin D status.Professor Hywel Williams, Director of the NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme, said: "The results of this NIHR-funded study brings together evidence from several other studies from over the world and is an important contribution to reducing uncertainties on whether Vitamin D is helpful for asthma - a common condition that impacts on many thousands of people worldwide. 

- "Study Shows Lifestyle Choices Have Significant Impact on Multiple Chronic Conditions, Significant Implications For Reducing CostsYale University,  October 05, 2021In a study published in the Journal of Preventive Medicine, Adams and colleagues showed a linear association between a number of modifiable risk factors and multiple chronic conditions, making those modifications a key to health care cost savings and to preventing a wide range of conditions.The data analyzed for the study, https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1VpFeKt2pmc9H, were from the publicly available 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and included 483,865 non-institutionalized US adults ages 18 years old or older. 

- Chronic conditions included asthma, arthritis, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cognitive impairment, cancer other than skin, and kidney disease. 

- Risk factors included obesity, current smoking, sedentary lifestyle, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption and sleeping other than seven to eight hours, while depression, hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes were considered in each category.Previous research by Thorpe and colleagues had estimated that the care of adults with four or more chronic conditions (17.1% of all adults in the study) is responsible for 77.6% of all health care costs in the U.S. today.The potential savings by reducing just two risk factors (diabetes and hypertension) and their related comorbidity was estimated previously by Ormond and colleagues at $9 billion annually over one to two years and closer to $25 billion a year after 5 years or more, factoring in possible complications.True Health Initiative founder, at Yale University  Director and study co-author David L. Katz, MD, MPH, FACLM, pointed out that in addition to costs, another implication of the study results is an individual's access to healthcare if they have one or more of the chronic conditions. 

- "The evidence shows that the risks for chronic disease are rooted in lifestyle choices," he said. 

- "More than ever, it is important to emphasize lifestyle medicine as the first treatment option for preventing, treating, and in some cases, reversing the cause of chronic conditions.

- "By teasing out the microbial changes that occur in the small bowel with age, medication use and diseases, we hope to identify unique components of the microbial community to target for therapeutics and interventions that could promote healthy aging," said Ruchi Mathur, MD, the study's principal investigator.Research exploring the gut microbiome, and its impact on health, has relied predominantly on fecal samples, which do not represent the entire gut, according to Mathur. 

- We have identified specific microbes that appear to be only influenced by the chronological age of the person," said Mathur, an endocrinologist and director of the Diabetes Outpatient Treatment & Education Center.The 21st century has been referred to as the "era of the gut microbiome" as scientists turn considerable attention to the role trillions of gut bacteria, fungi and viruses may play in human health and disease. 

- "Our goal is to identify and fingerprint the small intestinal microbial patterns of human health and disease. 

- Given the important role the small bowel plays in absorption of nutrients, changes in the microbiome in this location of the gut may have a greater impact on human health, and warrants further study," said Mark Pimentel, MD, director of the MAST program and a co-author of the study.This research is part of Cedars-Sinai's ongoing REIMAGINE study: Revealing the Entire Intestinal Microbiota and its Associations with the Genetic, Immunologic, and Neuroendocrine Ecosystem.Study finds no association between caffeine intake and invasive breast cancer riskUniversity of Buffalo, September 28, 2021Researchers from the University at Buffalo conducted a study of nearly 80,000 postmenopausal women in the U.S. to determine whether caffeine consumption from coffee and tea has any association with invasive breast cancer.The average age when U.S. women reach menopause, 51, also happens to coincide with the age group—50- to 64-year-olds—that has the highest reported caffeine consumption. 

- It is important for the public to know whether consumption of caffeinated beverages has beneficial or harmful effects on breast cancer, the most common type of cancer and second-leading cause of cancer death for U.S. women," said Lina Mu, MD, Ph.D., the study's senior author, who is an associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health at UB. 

- "The overlap of age at diagnosis of breast cancer and age with high consumption of caffeine, and the inconsistent findings from previous studies motivated us to study whether this lifestyle factor could affect breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women," said Kexin Zhu, a study co-first author and epidemiology Ph.D. student in UB's School of Public Health and Health Professions.Researchers looked at a sample of 79,871 participants in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. 

- Participants have for decades now completed yearly health questionnaires that help researchers learn more about diet and exercise habits, as well as disease, and any possible linkages.After a median follow-up of 16 years, there were 4,719 cases of invasive breast cancer identified.At first glance, women who reported drinking two to three cups of caffeinated coffee per day had a 12% higher risk of invasive breast cancer compared to non-drinkers. 

- An extract from broccoli sprouts given to male participants was shown to improve hepatic abnormalities and overall liver function significantly.For the study, the researchers conducted a double blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of males with fatty liver disease. 

- The researchers believe the antioxidants in broccoli sprouts are effective in suppressing the mechanisms of liver failure at a cellular level.The reduction of oxidative stress is crucial in protecting the liver and improving its health, and broccoli is loaded with health-supporting antioxidants.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is also reaching epidemic proportions, with nearly 30 percent of Americans (90 million people) having some level of the disease. 

- Eating plenty of organic fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly and avoiding alcohol and cigarettes can do wonders for liver health.As evidenced by the recent research out of Japan, sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprouts can be a key component in supporting healthy liver function. 

- Wierenga: "Ultimately, as a researcher, we want to understand how brain cells coordinate the balance and what happens when that balance is disturbed.Glycerin is safe, effective in psoriasis modelMedical College of Georgia at Augusta University, October 4, 2021Patients with psoriasis have reported that glycerin, an inexpensive, harmless, slightly sweet liquid high on the list of ingredients in many skin lotions, is effective at combatting their psoriasis and now scientists have objective evidence to support their reports.They found that whether applied topically or ingested in drinking water, glycerin, or glycerol, helps calm the classic scaly, red, raised and itchy patches in their psoriasismodel, Dr. Wendy Bollag, cell physiologist and skin researcher at the Medical College of Georgia and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center and her colleagues report in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences.The studies also provide more evidence of the different ways glycerin enables the healthy maturation of skin cells through four stages that result in a smooth, protective skin layer. 

- For example, it's a component of some high-end cosmetics, Bollag says.She suspects that this sort of two-punch combination, could help keep early signs of psoriasis at bay and, with more advanced disease, use existing psoriasis treatments to get the skin condition under control then start applying glycerin to help keep it that way.Bollag and her colleagues reported in 2018 in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology that in a mouse model of psoriasis, phosphtidylglycerol reduced inflammation and the characteristic raised skin lesions of psoriasis.While its exact cause is unclear, psoriasis is an immune-mediated condition and patients have higher levels of inflammation, as well as too many skin cells being produced then maturing abnormally. 

- The heightened inflammation also puts them at increased risk for problems like heart disease.Biologics used to treat psoriasis work different ways to stem this overactive immune response but in addition to their high cost, can put the patient at risk for problems like serious infections and cancer.

- Those in the experimental group took 3 grams of pumpkin seed oil every day.Brachial and central blood pressure, wave reflection (augmentation index, AIx), arterial stiffness (SI) and various HRV parameters were measured at baseline and at the end of the study.Those who took pumpkin seed oil had significantly lower AIx, brachial and systolic blood pressure after treatment. 

- SI and HRV parameters remained unchanged for the treatment group and the placebo group at the end of the study.In sum, taking pumpkin seed oil may improve arterial hemodynamics in postmenopausal women.Health benefits of evening classes revealedOxford University, September 20, 2021Those with a taste for adult education classes have long known it, but now Oxford University scientists have confirmed that taking part in the weekly sessions can boost wellbeing – regardless of the subject studied.In partnership with the Workers' Educational Association (WEA), the largest voluntary sector provider of adult education in England and Scotland, a team from Oxford's department of experimental psychology studied attendees at seven separate day-time adult education classes. 

- Participants were involved in one of three activities: singing, crafts or creative writing.Overall, attendees at all seven classes had improved mental and physical health and reported more satisfaction with their lives at the end of their courses.Dr Eiluned Pearce led the research. 

- We also found that the more someone felt part of their group, the more their health and wellbeing improved. 

- This research adds to growing support for the relevance of creative activities in creating happy communities and improving health and well-being, with consequent benefits for public services and society. 

- "But in the absence of major medical and social advances, ages much over this are highly unlikely ever to be observed," he added.For now, the oldest person on record is Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 at the confirmed age of 122.Her true age was the subject of some controversy, with claims of a possible fraud, but in 2019 several experts said a review of the evidence confirmed her age.Other pretenders to the throne of oldest person ever have a long way to go. 

- The oldest verified living person in the world is Japan's Kane Tanaka, a comparatively youthful 118.Psychological treatment shown to yield strong, lasting pain relief, alter brain networksUniversity of Colorado, September 29, 2021Rethinking what causes pain and how great of a threat it is can provide chronic pain patients with lasting relief and alter brain networks associated with pain processing, according to new University of Colorado Boulder-led research.The study, published Sept. 29 in JAMA Psychiatry, found that two-thirds of chronic back pain patients who underwent a four-week psychological treatment called Pain Reprocessing Therapy (PRT) were pain-free or nearly pain-free post-treatment. 

- "This treatment is based on the premise that the brain can generate pain in the absence of injury or after an injury has healed, and that people can unlearn that pain. 

- "The idea is that by thinking about the pain as safe rather than threatening, patients can alter the brain networks reinforcing the pain, and neutralize it," said Ashar, now a postdoctoral researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine.or the randomized controlled trial, Ashar and senior author Tor Wager, now the Diana L. Taylor Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience at Dartmouth College, recruited 151 men and women who had back pain for at least six months at an intensity of at least four on a scale of zero to 10.Those in the treatment group completed an assessment followed by eight one-hour sessions of PRT, a technique developed by Los Angeles-based pain psychologist Alan Gordon. 

- "Before and after treatment, participants also underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to measure how their brains reacted to a mild pain stimulus.After treatment, 66% of patients in the treatment group were pain-free or nearly pain-free compared to 20% of the placebo group and 10% of the no-treatment group. 

- "The magnitude and durability of pain reductions we saw are very rarely observed in chronic pain treatment trials," Ashar said, noting that opioids have yielded only moderate and short-term relief in many trials.And when people in the PRT group were exposed to pain in the scanner post-treatment, brain regions associated with pain processing—including the anterior insula and anterior midcingulate —had quieted significantly.The authors stress that the treatment is not intended for "secondary pain"—that rooted in acute injury or disease.The study focused specifically on PRT for chronic back pain, so future, larger studies are needed to determine if it would yeild similar results for other types of chronic pain.Meanwhile, other similar brain-centered techniques are already ememrging among physical therapists and other clinicians who treat pain. 

- "This study suggests a fundamentally new way to think about both the causes of chronic back pain for many people and the tools that are available to treat that pain," said co-author Sona Dimidjian, professor of psychology and neuroscience and director of the Renee Crown Wellness Institute at CU Boulder.

- Virologists reveal how poor man’s amino acid cure for COVID-19 would abolish need for vaccinesBio-Virus Research Inc (Nevada), September 15, 2021A natural cure for COVID-19 that is widely available and affordable for even the poorest of people on the planet has been confirmed by a team of virologists who have spent a lifetime studying the underlying causes of viral infections.Backed by decades of research and safety data for herpes-family viruses, U.S.-based researchers at Bio-Virus Research Inc, Reno, Nevada, report on the successful treatment of the first 30 frontline doctors and nurses and a thousand-plus patients given the amino acid lysine to prevent and even abolish COVID-19 coronavirus infections at a clinic in the Dominican Republic. 

- Astonishingly, symptoms of COVID-19 are reported to have dissipated within hours of this natural treatment.The medical staff at a clinic in the Dominican Republic was coming down with two cases of coronavirus per month before lysine therapy was instituted.The virologists, Drs. 

- Lysine has been safely used for decades to quell herpes virus outbreaks that cause cold sores on the lips (herpes labialis), a treatment pioneered by one of the Bio-Virus Research team members in 1974.Lysine is available in foods and in concentrated form in inexpensive dietary supplements (250 500-milligram lysine tablets can be purchased for under $5 US or 2-cents per tablet), making affordable lysine therapy possible.Lysine/arginine imbalance would explain why patients who have been infected with COVID-19 have recurrent infections, even after vaccination.Lysine Rx in Dominican RepublicThe daily therapeutic supplement regimen for the medical staff in the Dominican Republic consisted of 2000 milligrams of lysine capsules along with restricted dietary consumption of arginine-rich foods such as nuts, chocolate, orange juice, pumpkin, sesame seeds, wheat germ.The Bio-Virus Research team found doses of supplemental lysine up to 4000 milligrams to be safe and effective.Foods that have a high ratio of lysine over arginine such as eggs, tofu, fish (not raw), sardines, cheese, meats such as pork, poultry and red meat, and yogurt) provide a high ratio of lysine over arginine, thus blocking replication of all coronaviruses including COVID-19.According to the virologists who were interviewed by this reporter, over 1000 patients have now been successfully treated with surprisingly rapid dissolution of symptoms and return to health. 

- The average intake of arginine is estimated to be 4000-6000 milligrams per day.Other health benefitsSupplemental lysine also has other health benefits. 

- When lysine (and vitamin C) occupy those binding sites, cholesterol is not deposited in arteries.Prevalence of herpes viral infectionsWorldwide many billions of people harbor dormant herpes viruses that erupt into disease from time to time. 

- There is no shortage.Billions may benefitThe most frequent medical application of lysine therapy has been the quelling of active herpes infections (on skin, lips, etc. 

- ), and eradication of Epstein-Barr infection, Bell’s palsy, etc.Researchers bemoan the fact that lysine therapy hasn’t become a mainstay in the treatment of herpes infections that affect ~80% of the world’s population over expensive and problematic anti-viral drugs because it doesn’t generate sufficient profit to attract funding for human clinical trials. 

- Lysine is superior to various anti-viral drugs.If lysine lives up to its promise as a universal COVID-19 antidote for therapeutic and preventive use, unless billionaire Bill Gates buys up and mothballs all the lysine production plants in the world like he has bought off agricultural land, and bought off news media, vaccine makers and politicians, the need for vaccines will become a moot and meaningless practice for COVID-19.Because of the long-term safety record of this dietary amino acid, the public can take lysine as a non-prescription preventive “medicine.”Epidemiologists baffled by low rate of coronavirus infections in IndiaDespite its large population and poor sanitation, disease trackers are baffled by India’s low rate of coronavirus infections. 

- Maybe it is India’s lysine-rich diet of yogurt, lamb, chicken, fish curry that protects its population from viral disease. 

- If not for COVID-19, at least for herpes infections.The shame is on the World Health Organization with a budget of $8.482 billion or the Centers For Disease Control with a budget of $7.875 billion that overlook safe and economical cures like lysine. 

- This report serves as evidence the world is being gamed to plunder the masses of their health and wealth. 

- The people of the world need to stop heeding advice from public health officials and practice preventive medicine on their own volition.There is additional evidence that lysine also halts the growth of influenza and coxsackie viruses.Further researchResearchers at Bio-Virus Research Inc. are searching for research funds to further document the benefits of lysine therapy.Omega-3 and Omega-6 supplement improves reading for childrenUniversity of Gothenburg, Sweden - September 14, 2021Supplement of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may improve reading skills of mainstream schoolchildren, according to a new study from Sahlgrenska Academy, at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. 

- To be more certain about the results, they should also be replicated in other studies," says Mats Johnson.The article Omega 3/6 fatty acids for reading in children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 9-year-old mainstream schoolchildren in Sweden was published by The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.Elevated stress hormones linked to higher risk of high blood pressure and heart eventsKyoto University (Japan) & University of California at Los Angeles, Sept. 13, 2021Adults with normal blood pressure and high levels of stress hormones were more likely to develop high blood pressure and experience cardiovascular events compared to those who had lower stress hormone levels, according to new research published today in Hypertension, an American Heart Association journal.Studies have shown that cumulative exposure to daily stressors and exposure to traumatic stress can increase cardiovascular disease risk. 

- A growing body of research refers to the mind-heart-body connection, which suggests a person’s mind can positively or negatively affect cardiovascular health, cardiovascular risk factors and risk for cardiovascular disease events, as well as cardiovascular prognosis over time.“The stress hormones norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and cortisol can increase with stress from life events, work, relationships, finances and more. 

- Inoue also is affiliated with the department of epidemiology at the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles.“Previous research focused on the relationship between stress hormone levels and hypertension or cardiovascular events in patients with existing hypertension. 

- In this study, we aimed to investigate the dietary treatment effect of Spirulina platensis on learning deficits in high fat diet (HFD) fed mice and clarify the potential mechanisms via investigating the gut microbiome-brain axis. 

- This study provides further evidence for the application of Spirulina platensis as functional supplement for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.Spirulina platensis was frequently used as both a food ingredient and a medical supplement to counteract various metabolic disorders worldwide. 

- This study provides potent evidence for the application of Spirulina platensis as functional supplement for treatment of AD.Regular exercise may lower risk of developing anxiety by almost 60%University of Lund (Sweden), September 13, 2021A quick online search for ways to improve our mental health will often come up with a myriad of different results. 

- However, one of the most common suggestions put forward as a step to achieving wellness—and preventing future issues—is doing some physical exercise, whether it be a walk or playing a team sport.Anxiety disorders—which typically develop early in a person's life—are estimated to affect approximately 10% of the world's population and has been found to be twice as common in women compared to men. 

- And while exercise is put forward as a promising strategy for the treatment of anxiety, little is known about the impact of exercise dose, intensity or physical fitness level on the risk of developing anxiety disorders.To help answer this question, researchers in Sweden have published a study in Frontiers in Psychiatry to show that those who took part in the world's largest long-distance cross-country ski race (Vasaloppet) between 1989 and 2010 had a "significantly lower risk" of developing anxiety compared to non-skiers during the same period.The study is based on data from almost 400,000 people in one of the largest ever population-wide epidemiology studies across both sexes.Surprising finding among female skiers"We found that the group with a more physically active lifestyle had an almost 60% lower risk of developing anxiety disorders over a follow-up period of up to 21 years," said first author of the paper, Martine Svensson, and her colleague and principal investigator, Tomas Deierborg, of the Department of Experimental Medical Science at Lund University, Sweden. 

- "However, the authors found a noticeable difference in exercise performance level and the risk of developing anxiety between male and female skiers.While a male skier's physical performance did not appear to affect the risk of developing anxiety, the highest performing group of female skiers had almost the double risk of developing anxiety disorders compared to the group which was physically active at a lower performance level. 

- Furthermore, some of the largest studies looking at this topic only included men, were much smaller in sample size, and had either limited or no follow-up data to track the long-term effects of physical activity on mental health.Next steps for researchThe surprising discovery of an association between physical performance and the risk for anxiety disorders in women also emphasized the scientific importance of these findings for follow-up research. 

- "Our results suggest that the relation between symptoms of anxiety and exercise behavior may not be linear," Svensson said. 

- "Exercise behaviors and anxiety symptoms are likely to be affected by genetics, psychological factors, and personality traits, confounders that were not possible to investigate in our cohort. 

- Studies investigating the driving factors behind these differences between men and women when it comes to extreme exercise behaviors and how it affects the development of anxiety are needed. 

- But does this mean that skiing in particular can play an important role in keeping anxiety at bay, as opposed to any other form of exercise? 

- Not so, Svensson and Deierborg said, given that previous studies have also shown the benefits of keeping fit on our mental health. 

- "Studies focusing on specific sports may find slightly different results and magnitudes of the associations, but this is most likely due to other important factors that affect mental health and which you cannot easily control in research analysis.Gut microbes are key to health benefit delivered by hops compoundOregon State University, September 13, 2021The health-enhancing performance of a compound found in hops is dependent upon its interactions with intestinal microorganisms, new research by Oregon State University shows.Understanding how xanthohumol, often abbreviated as XN, works is important for unlocking its potential to counter diet-induced obesity and the health risksassociated with a global obesity epidemic, including type 2 diabetes and liver and heart disease, researcher Adrian Gombart says. 

- Faulty glucose metabolism also negatively affects brain physiology and is at the root of multiple medical conditions including diabetes and heart disease.In previous studies involving mice, Gombart and colleagues found that XN improved the animals' health and changed the composition of their microbiome, the latter leading them to suspect that the mix of microbes played a role in XN's healthful effects. 

- "Gombart added that the study yielded some evidence that those three microbes are at least partially responsible for the health benefits associated with XN, but the entire microbial community may be playing a role as well. 

- It causes the pancreas to make more and more insulin to keep blood glucose levels within a non-harmful range and is a risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Antioxidant protects neuronsUniversity of Edinburgh   September 12 2021Research involving a potent antioxidant, described in Scientific Reports, suggests that the compound could help protect cells in several conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosisand cell transplants.In their report, a team from the University of Edinburgh observe that the flavonoids quercetin and myricetin are among the most potent dietary antioxidants. 

- Neither therapy affected normal embryonic development.“This novel antioxidant can be applied to investigate oxidative stress in disease models, like alpha-synucleinopathies and other neurodegeneration models,” Nicola J. Drummond and colleagues conclude. 

- These effects appear to be both concentration and administration route dependent, and may not be achievable using unenriched propolis as a dietary intervention.20-Week Study of Clinical Outcomes of Over-the-Counter COVID-19 Prophylaxis and TreatmentComprehensive Pain Management Institute (Ohio), August 6, 2021New research published in the Journal of Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine shows that early intervention against a Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) infection using natural, over-the-counter remedies is a safe and effective way to avoid complications.Researchers from Ohio looked at modalities that are readily available for the Chinese Virus, including zinc, zinc ionophores, vitamins C, D3, and E, and l-lysine. 

- Adjustments were made for those with pre-existing health conditions and other health factors that may have influenced the outcome.Since all of the remedies utilized fall into the “low cost” category, anyone can access them. 

- Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol component of green tea, is a natural zinc ionophore that improves zinc absorption.For this latest study, the research team used quina (cinchona) plant bark extract and quercetin as zinc ionophores, as these, too, help to deliver more healing nutrients like zinc to the cells.“The core supplementation formulation components have been demonstrated … to have beneficial effects both outside of and within clinical settings in the prevention of viral infections and also in the treatment of early stages of such diseases,” the study reveals.“Zinc ionophores can … be utilized to gain the anti-viral benefit of enhanced intracellular Zn+2 concentrations while limiting tolerance / side-effect / toxicity issues associated with elevated serum levels of zinc supplementation.”You can review the full paper at this link.Neuroprotective effect of L-carnitine against glyceraldehyde-induced metabolic impairmentUniversity Politecnica delle Marche (Italy), September 7, 2021According to news reporting originating from Ancona, Italy, research stated, “Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive regression and memory loss. 

- Overall, these findings suggest that the use of LC can promote cell survival in the setting of the metabolic impairments commonly observed in AD.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Our data suggest that LC may act by maintaining mitochondrial function and by reducing the pTau level.”Hyperbaric oxygen study shows reversal of biologic hallmarks responsible for development of Alzheimer diseaseTel Aviv University  & Shamir Medical Center (Israel), September 10, 2021A new study, published today in peer-review medical journal Aging, marks the first time non-pharmaceutical clinical exploration proves efficacy in reversing the main activators of Alzheimer's disease.Using a specific protocol of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), cerebral blood flow (CBF) improved/increased in elderly patients by 16-23%, alleviating vascular dysfunction and amyloid burden. 

- The study, part of a comprehensive research program directed toward aging and accompanying ailments as a reversible disease, holds promise for a new strategic approach to the prevention of Alzheimer's by addressing not only the symptoms or targeting biomarkers, but rather the core pathology and biology responsible for the advancement of the disease.Vascular dysfunction is a crucial element in the development of Alzheimer's and cognitive decline:Amyloid beta deposits in the brain blood vessel walls are the most common vascular pathology in Alzheimer's.Reduced blood flow to the brain and its related decrease in oxygen supply (hypoxia) can precede the clinical onset of dementia and correlates with the degree of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's.The comprehensive research, conducted at the Sagol School of Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University and the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Shamir Medical Center, was led by study co-authors, Professor Shai Efrati, M.D. 

- Using combined data from an animal model of Alzheimer's, where effects were evaluated directly on brain tissue (Sagol School of Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University); humans, assessed with the use of high-resolution MRI and computerized cognitive test (Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Shamir Medical Center); correlating results displayed beneficial effects of HBOT on patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the stage before dementia. 

- "After dedicating our HBOT research to exploring its impact on the areas of brain functionality and age-related cognitive decline, we have discovered for the first time HBOT induces degradation and clearance of pre-existing amyloid plaques – treatment, and the appearance of newly formed plaques- prevention," explains Professor Uri Ashery. 

- "Elderly patients suffering from significant memory loss at baseline revealed an increase in brain blood flow and improvement in cognitive performance, demonstrating HBOT potency to reverse core elements responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease. 

- More research is underway to further demonstrate how HBOT can improve cognitive function and become an influential tool in the imperative fight against the disease," affirms Professor Efrati, research group leader and medical advisor to Aviv Scientific.Aviv has developed a unique medical treatment protocol that includes HBOT, cognitive and physical training, and nutritional coaching, to enhance brain and body performance of aging adults at Aviv Clinics, currently available in Central Florida and Dubai.HBOT is already used in patients with other pathologies and is known to be a relatively safe treatment modality, illustrating its potential to be easily implanted in clinical practice. 

- The researchers note this was due to fermenting of plant material in the gut.The researchers suggest their experiments show that a plant-based diet promotes more healthy types of gut bacteria which leads to better overall gut health.Physical exercise can relieve tumor-associated anemiaUniversity of Basel (Switzerland), September 10, 2021Many cancer patients suffer from anemia leaving them fatigued, weak, and an impaired ability to perform physical activity. 

- Researchers at the University of Basel have now been able to show what causes the anemia, and that physical exercise can improve this condition.The two major symptoms of cancer are loss of muscle mass and a reduced hemoglobin level, leading to weight loss, fatigue, lethargy and reduced physical performance. 

- Why cancer causes muscle atrophy and anemia is not yet understood, and treatment is currently difficult.The fact that anemia leads to a decline of the overall state of health and can negatively affect the course of cancer therapy highlights the urgency to obtain insights into causes and potential remedies. 

- The study published in Science Advances shows that exercise normalizes these metabolic abnormalities and thereby reduces the anemia caused by cancer.The body tries to counteract the degradation by increasing red blood cell productionin the bone marrow and the spleen—without success. 

- Macrophages are a type of white blood cells and part of the immune system.Exercise normalizes metabolism and alleviates anemiaThe research group attempted to normalize the metabolism by pharmacological means. 

- In contrast, however, the metabolism was regulated to such an extent by exercise that the anemia also decreased. 

- The findings suggest that exercise is a useful therapy for cancer patients, in order to counteract anemia and associated fatigue and lethargy and in turn to improve their general well-being and quality of life. 

- This also leads to improved tolerance of radio- and chemotherapy, as has previously been established.Mango could help maintain gut bacteria at risk from high-fat dietsOklahoma State University, September 13, 2021Mango consumption could help prevent the loss of beneficial gut bacteria caused by a high fat diet, according to research on mice.The findings, published in the Journal of Nutrition , appears to reveal for the first time the positive impact of mango on gut microbiota.In the study, 60 male mice were assigned to one of four dietary treatment groups for 12 weeks - control (with 10% of calories from fat), high fat (with 60% calories from fat), or high fat with 1% or 10% mango. 

- All high-fat diets had similar macronutrient, calcium, phosphorus, and fiber content.“We investigated the effects of freeze-dried mango pulp combined with an high-fat diet on the cecal microbial population and its relation to body composition, lipids, glucose parameters, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and gut inflammatory markers in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity,” the study reports.The high-fat dietary treatment with 10% mango (equivalent to 1½ cups of fresh mango pieces) was found to be the most effective in preventing the loss of beneficial bacteria from a high-fat diet without decreasing body weight or fat accumulation.Specifically, mango supplementation regulated gut bacteria in favor of Bifidobacteria and Akkermansia and enhanced short-chain fatty acid (SFCA) production. 

- The results of this animal study showed that adding mango to the diet may help maintain and regulate gut health and levels of beneficial bacteria levels.”India, China, Indonesia and Thailand are the top four Mango growing countries, accounting for well over half the total global production.Although more research is needed on the effects of mango on human health, this study suggests that mango consumption may be important in improving gut health particularly for those consuming a high-fat diet, the researchers concluded.

Eating a plant rich diet reduces risk of developing COVID-19King's College London, September 8, 2021A recent study, published in Gut, by researchers from King's and Harvard Medical School, examines data from nearly 600,000 ZOE COVID Study app contributors. 

- 19% of these contributors contracted COVID-19.People with the highest quality diet were around 10% less likely to develop COVID-19 than those with the lowest quality diet, and 40% less likely to fall severely ill.This is the first longitudinal study of diet and COVID-19 and the first to show that a healthy diet cuts the chances of developing the disease in the first place.Rather than looking at specific foods or nutrients, the survey was designed to look at broader dietary patterns which are reflective of how people actually eat. 

- Factors included age, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, smoking, physical activity and underlying health conditions. 

- Mask-wearing habits and population density were also considered.The impact of diet was amplified by individual life situations, with people living in low-income neighborhoods and having the lowest quality diet being around 25% more at risk from COVID-19 than people in more affluent communities who were eating in the same way.Based on these results, the researchers estimate that nearly a quarter of COVID-19 cases could have been prevented if these differences in diet quality and socioeconomic status had not existed.This further highlights that improved access to nutritious, healthier food could be substantive for bettering public health, especially among the underprivileged members of the community.Professor Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at the School of Life Course Sciences, says that "these findings chime with recent results from our landmark PREDICT study, showing that people who eat higher quality diets (with low levels of ultra-processed foods) have a healthier collection of microbes in their guts, which is linked to better health. 

- You don't have to go vegan, but getting more diverse plants on your plate is a great way to boost the health of your gut microbiome, improve your immunity and overall health, and potentially reduce your risk from COVID-19. 

- "Targeting the gut to relieve rheumatoid arthritisUniversity College London, September 6, 2021UCL researchers have shown that damage to the lining of the gut plays an important role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis, paving the way for a new approach to treating the disease.In the pre-clinical study, which used mouse models and patient samples, the research team propose that restoration of the gut-barrier could offer a new therapeutic approach to reducing the severity of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms.Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease that causes joint pain, swelling, and inflammation. 

- Despite understanding of some of the genetic and environmental factors that might be involved in the development of arthritis, scientists still do not completely understand what initiates disease and how it accelerates. 

- Recent research in this area is exploring how the bacteria in the gut might be involved in the development of arthritis, with researchers suggesting that growth of 'bad' bacteria in the gut might play a part in initiating the disease.Co-lead author, Professor Claudia Mauri (UCL Division of Infection & Immunity), said: "We wanted to know what was happening in the gut and whether changes to the intestinal lining—which usually acts as a barrier to protect the body from bacteria—are a feature of the disease and contribute to its development. 

- "Using pre-clinical mouse models and patient samples, the team found that blood markers of gut damage were raised compared to healthy people even at the earliest stages of arthritis, and that these markers of damage got higher the more the disease progressed; and, unexpectedly, there were distinct signs of inflammation, as might be seen in inflammatory bowel disease. 

- "Current treatments for rheumatoid arthritis don't appear to correct the problems in the gut and so may leave the patient susceptible to reactivation of disease from the continuing inflammation in that area. 

- Maintaining gut health both through diet and pharmacological intervention may be a valuable new strategy. 

- "Body fat mass percentage reduced among trial participants who received melatonin supplementsShahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (Iran), September 3, 2021According to news reporting originating from the Department of Clinical Nutrition and Dieteticsby research stated, “Obesity, as the most common metabolic disorder in the world, is characterized by excess body fat. 

- This study is aimed at determining the effects of melatonin supplementation on body weight, nody mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and body fat mass percentage (BFMP) in people with overweight or obesity.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Department of Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics: “Thirty eight overweight or class-I obese adult individuals were recruited in the study (8 men and 30 women). 

- Nevertheless, the results of the present study alone are not sufficient to conclude on the effects of melatonin consumption on anthropometric indices, and it seems that further studies are required in this regard.”Boom in social stress may contribute to population declineUMass Amherst scientist has new hypothesis for changes in reproductive behavior and physiologyUniversity of Massachusetts, September 7, 2021A University of Massachusetts Amherst environmental health scientist has developed an “overlooked hypothesis” to help explain the projected global population decline beginning in 2064: social stress.Stress from social media and other largely empty or overwhelming social interactions may be leading or contributing to changes in reproductive behavior and reproductive physiology, suggests Alexander Suvorov, associate professor in the UMass Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences.In a review article, published in the journal Endocrinology, he examines various theories surrounding previous human population decline as models predict a “remarkable” decrease from 9.7 billion people in 2064 to 8.8 billion by 2100. 

- “I hope it will trigger interest of people from very different domains and that after additional studies we will have a much better picture of to what extent population density is connected with social stress and how social stress is connected to reproduction, and what we can do about it.”A common-sense place to start, he suggests: “Back off social media.”Vitamin D cuts asthma exacerbation by 74% in children: ReviewAnhui Medical University (China), August 30 2021Vitamin D supplementation may cut the risk of asthma exacerbation in children but it does not impact respiratory infections in healthy children, a review has found.The review of seven randomised controlled clinical trials weighed up "inconsistent" findings on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of childhood acute respiratory infections (ARI).Published in the British Journal of Nutrition, it found overall there was not a statistically significant reduction in the risk of ARI, all-cause mortality or the rate of hospital admission due to respiratory infection in healthy children.However, in children previously diagnosed with asthma, vitamin D supplementation resulted in a 74% reduction in the risk of asthma exacerbation. 

- "Potential impactAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) about 235 million people suffer from asthma, which is particularly common in children. 

- According to a 2013 paper , an estimated 11.9 million episodes of severe ARI and three million episodes of very severe ARI in young children resulted in hospital admissions in 2010 globally.Meanwhile a separate paper from the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group of WHO and UNICEF  found almost two-thirds of the 7.6 million children worldwide who died within the first five years of life died of infectious diseases. 

- Within these two-thirds, pneumonia was the leading cause for a total of 1.396 million deaths.WHO has said in the past that further research on vitamin D supplementation and the possible decrease in frequency and severity of respiratory infections in children was needed before specific recommendations could be made.The Chinese researchers wrote in their review: "Although vitamin D is widely recognised for its importance in calcium metabolism and bone health, researchers have spent several years focusing on its growing number of possible non-calcaemic health effects. 

- "The review was conducted by researchers at the Anhui Medical University, Shaoxing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Huzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Anhui Institute of Schistosomiasis Control and the Anhui Provincial Family Planning Institute of Science and Technology in China.It included trials in Japan, Afghanistan, India, Poland and Mongolia that compared vitamin D supplementation with either placebo or no intervention in children younger than 18 years of age.Source: British Journal of NutritionCoQ10 may improve facial wrinkles: RCTInstitute of Cosmetics ( Slovenia), September 9, 2021High dose co-enzyme Q10 supplementation may improve wrinkles around the eyes and other parts of the face, says a new study.Scientists from the Institute of Cosmetics in Ljubljana, Slovenia report that 150 mg per day of CoQ10 (Q10Vital) for 12 weeks were associated with reduced wrinkles around the eyes, and around the mouth and lips, compared with placebo.On the other hand, no photoprotection or effects on skin hydration or thickness were observed, according to findings published in Biofactors .“In the present study, the administration of a dietary supplement containing CoQ10 over a 12-week period showed several anti-ageing effects as it reduced wrinkles, improved skin smoothness and microrelief as well as skin firmness. 

- The study’s findings were published in the journal Nutrition Research.Pomegranate fruit peel is considered an agricultural waste product. 

- However, it is a rich source of polyphenols like punicalins, punicalagins and ellagic acids.Earlier studies have shown that products derived from pomegranates have health benefits, including antibacterial activity, in vitro.There is limited evidence, however, of their antibacterial activity in vivo.For this study, researchers sought to determine the antibacterial properties of pomegranate peel extract in vivo. 

- Fecal excretions were also analyzed for C. rodentium.The results revealed that the pomegranate peel extract reduced weight loss and mortality induced by C. rodentium infection.The extract also reduced C. rodentium colonization of the spleen.Additionally, pomegranate peel extract decreased the extent of damage in the colon caused by C. rodentium infection.In sum, pomegranate fruit peel extract contains bioactive compounds that can help reduce the severity of C. rodentium infection in vivo.Vitamin D may protect against young-onset colorectal cancerDana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard  School of Public Health, September 1, 2021Consuming higher amounts of Vitamin D - mainly from dietary sources - may help protect against developing young-onset colorectal cancer or precancerous colon polyps, according to the first study to show such an association.The study, recently published online in the journal Gastroenterology, by scientists from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Harvard T.H. 

- Chan School of Public Health, and other institutions, could potentially lead to recommendations for higher vitamin D intake as an inexpensive complement to screening tests as a colorectal cancer prevention strategy for adults younger than age 50.While the overall incidence of colorectal cancer has been declining, cases have been increasing in younger adults - a worrisome trend that has yet to be explained. 

- glasses of milk - was associated with an approximately 50% lower risk of developing young-onset colorectal cancer.”The results of the study were obtained by calculating the total vitamin D intake - both from dietary sources and supplements - of 94,205 women participating in the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II). 

- The women are followed every two years by questionnaires on demographics, diet and lifestyle factors, and medical and other health-related information. 

- “Our results further support that vitamin D may be important in younger adults for health and possibly colorectal cancer prevention,” said Ng. 

- “It is critical to understand the risk factors that are associated with young-onset colorectal cancer so that we can make informed recommendations about diet and lifestyle, as well as identify high risk individuals to target for earlier screening.”Choosing personal exercise goals, then tackling them immediately is key to sustaining changeUniversity of Pennsylvania, September 1, 2021When people set their own exercise goals – and then pursue them immediately – it’s more likely to result in lasting positive changes, according to a new study at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. 

- These findings are particularly important because the patients were from lower-income neighborhoods and may face a number of challenges in achieving health goals.”This study consisted of 500 patients from low-income neighborhoods, mainly in West Philadelphia but also elsewhere in and outside of the city. 

- Participants either had a cardiovascular disease or were assessed to have a near-10 percent risk of developing one within a decade. 

- The work usually tested whether playing a game attached to physical activity goals could make significant increases against not playing a game, or between different versions of a game.As with past studies, every participant was given a wearable step tracker that recorded their daily step counts through Penn’s Way to Health platform. 

- And, in addition to raw step counts, the study also measured periods of sustained, high activity, amounting to an average increase of 4.1 minutes daily.Comparatively, those who were assigned their goals or had full goals delayed for half the intervention only increased their daily steps above the control group’s average by between 500 and 600 steps.“Individuals who select their own goals are more likely to be intrinsically motivated to follow through on them,” said Kevin Volpp, MD, PhD, director of the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics. 

- “This indicates that gamification with self-chosen and immediate goals helped these patients form a new habit.”Many programs, whether offered through work or by health insurance companies, offer incentives for boosts in physical activity. 

- And if these adjustments lead to gains among people with lower incomes, whom cardiovascular disease kill at 76 percent higher rates, that could be particularly important.“Goal-setting is a fundamental element of almost every physical activity program, whether through a smartphone app or in a workplace wellness program,” Volpp said. 

- “Our findings reveal a simple approach that could be used to improve the impact of these programs and the health of their patients.”Comparing seniors who relocate long-distance shows that where you live affects your longevityMassachusetts Institute of Technology, September 1, 2021Would you like to live longer? 

- "There's a substantively important causal effect of where you live as an elderly adult on mortality and life expectancy across the United States," says Amy Finkelstein, a professor in MIT's Department of Economics and co-author of a newly published paper detailing the findings.Researchers have long observed significant regional variation in life expectancy in the U.S., and often attributed it to "health capital"—tendencies toward obesity, smoking, and related behavioral factors in the regional populations. 

- But by analyzing the impact of moving, the current study can isolate and quantify the effect that the location itself has on residents.As such, the research delivers important new information about large-scale drivers of U.S. health outcomes—and raises the question of what it is about different places that affects the elderly's life expectancy. 

- One clear possibility is the nature of available medical care. 

- "We wanted to separate out the role of people's prior experiences and behaviors—or health capital—from the role of place or environment," Finkelstein says.The paper, "Place-Based Drivers of Mortality: Evidence of Migration," is published in the August issue of the American Economic Review. 

- "Different people have different health profiles before they move, of course. 

- But Medicare records include detailed claims data, so the researchers applied records of 27 different illnesses and conditions—ranging from lung cancer and diabetes to depression—to a standard mortality risk model, to categorize the overall health of seniors when they move. 

- Using these "very, very rich pre-move measures of their health," Finkelstein notes, the researchers tried to account for pre-existing health levels of seniors from the same location who moved to different places.Still, even assessing people by 27 measures does not completely describe their health, so Finkelstein, Gentzkow, and Williams also estimated what fraction of people's health conditions they had not observed—essentially by calibrating the observed health of seniors against health capital levels in places they were moving from. 

- They then consider how observed health varies across individuals from the same location moving to different destinations and, assuming that differences in unobserved health—such as physical mobility—vary in the same way as observed differences in health, they adjust their estimates accordingly.All told, the study found that many urban areas on the East and West Coasts—including New York City, San Francisco, and Miami—have positive effects on longevity for seniors moving there. 

- Much of the Southwest, including parts of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Arizona, fares similarly poorly.The scholars also estimate that health capital accounts for about 70 percent of the difference in longevity across areas of the U.S., and that location effects account for about 15 percent of the variation. 

- "Yes, health capital is important, but yes, place effects also matter," Finkelstein says.Other leading experts in health economics say they are impressed by the study. 

- Jonathan Skinner, the James O. Freeman Presidential Professor of Economics, Emeritus, at Dartmouth College, says the scholars "have provided a critical insight" into the question of place effects "by considering older people who move from one place to another, thus allowing the researchers to cleanly identify the pure effect of the new location on individual health—an effect that is often different from the health of long-term residents. 

- This is an important study that will surely be cited and will influence health policy in coming years. 

- In places where, say, smoking is highly prevalent, population-wide longevity might be subpar, but other factors might make it a place where people of average health will live longer. 

- "With that in mind, Finkelstein, Gentzkow, and Williams, along with other colleagues, are working on a pair of new studies about health care practices to see what impact place-based differences may have; one study focuses on doctors, and the other looks at the prescription opioid epidemic.In the background of this research is a high-profile academic and policy discussion about the impact of health care utilization. 

- One perspective, associated with the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care project, suggests that the large regional differences in health care use it has documented have little impact on mortality. 

- But the current study, by quantifying the variable impact of place, suggest there may be, in turn, a bigger differential impact in health care utilization yet to be identified.For her part, Finkelstein says she would welcome further studies digging into health care use or any other factor that might explain why different places have different effects on life expectancy; the key is uncovering more hard evidence, wherever it leads. 

- "Differences in health care across places are large and potentially important," Finkelstein says. 

- These shifts may result in negative effects on the brain," explains the microbiologist and immunologist.Patterns in the microbiome provide clues to brain damage"In fact, we have been able to identify certain patterns in the microbiome and immune response that are clearly linked to the progression and severity of brain injury," adds David Berry, microbiologist and head of the research group at the Centre for Microbiology and Environmental Systems Science (CMESS) at the University of Vienna as well as Operational Director of the Joint Microbiome Facility of the Medical University of Vienna and University of Vienna. 

- "Our data show that excessive growth of the bacterium Klebsiella and the associated elevated γδ-T-cell levels can apparently exacerbate brain damage," explains Lukas Wisgrill, Neonatologist from the Division of Neonatology, Pediatric Intensive Care Medicine and Neuropediatrics at the Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine at the Medical University of Vienna.

- "Amino acid supplements may boost vascular endothelial function in older adults: StudyUniversity of Alabama, August 28, 2021A combination of HMB (a metabolite of leucine), glutamine and arginine may improve vascular function and blood flow in older people, says a new study.Scientists from the University of Alabama report that a supplement containing HMB (beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate), glutamine and arginine (Juven by Abbott Nutrition) increased flow-mediated dilation (FMD - a measure of blood flow and vascular health) by 27%, whereas no changes were observed in the placebo group.However, the researchers did not observe any changes to markers of inflammation, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)“Our results indicate that 6 months of dietary supplementation with HMB, glutamine and arginine had a positive impact on vascular endothelial function in older adults,” wrote the researchers, led by Dr Amy Ellis in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition . 

- “However, although we observed a trend for increasing hsCRP among the placebo group (P=0.059), no significant changes in hsCRP or TNF-alpha were observed for either group.“Possibly, the effects of the supplement on reducing oxidative stress and inflammation were subclinical, or the high variability in these biomarkers, particularly hsCRP, among our small sample could have precluded visible differences.”The researchers also noted that an alternate mechanism may also be responsible, adding that arginine is a precursor of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide“Although investigation of this mechanism was beyond the scope of this study, it is feasible that the arginine in the supplement improved endothelial-dependent vasodilation by providing additional substrate for nitric oxide synthesis,” they added.Moderate coffee drinking associated with lower risk of mortality during 11-year median follow-upSemmelweis University (Bulgaria), September 1 2021.Research presented at ESC (European Society of Cardiology) Congress 2021 revealed a lower risk of dying from any cause during an 11-year median period among light to moderate coffee drinkers in comparison with men and women who had no intake.The study included 468,629 UK Biobank participants of an average age of 56.2 years who had no indications of heart disease upon enrollment.

- Moreover, 0.5 to 3 cups of coffee per day was independently associated with lower risks of stroke, death from cardiovascular disease, and death from any cause.”

Both sucrose and high fructose corn syrup linked to increased health risksUniversity of California at Davis, August 31, 2021Consuming sucrose, the more "natural form of sugar," may be as bad for your health as consuming high fructose corn syrup, according to a University of California, Davis, study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. 

- "This is the first dietary intervention study to show that consumption of both sucrose- and high fructose corn-sweetened beverages increase liver fat and decrease insulin sensitivity," said Kimber Stanhope, a research nutrition biologist with the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. 

- "That's concerning because the prevalence of fatty liver [nonalcoholic fatty liver disease] and Type 2 diabetes continues to increase globally. 

- Sucrose may be labeled as sugar, cane sugar or evaporated cane juice among other names, but they're all sugar.Consumer misconceptionStanhope said the study is important because many consumers consider high fructose corn syrup to be more detrimental to health than sucrose. 

- In-home examinations obtained physical measurements, information concerning medication use, a physical health summary, electrocardiographic evaluation, and blood and urine sample collection. 

- The protective effect of the diet was limited to participants with no history of coronary heart disease at the beginning of the study.Among men and women whose adherence to the Southern dietary pattern was among the top quarter of participants, the risk of sudden cardiac death was 46% higher than those among the lowest quarter.“We know of no published studies investigating the possible associations of dietary patterns with risk of sudden cardiac death,” wrote authors James M. Shikany, DrPH, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and colleagues. 

- In a similar way, some dietary supplements have been shown to counteract age related changes that contribute to neuromuscular dysfunction (reviewed by [12) Plant flavonoids have gained particular attention as dietary compounds for keeping good health and preventing a number of diseases, particularly cardiac disorders and cancer.The Calderó Research Team concluded in their Aging-US Research Output that, green tea and cocoa flavonoids from GTE and cocoa significantly increased survival rate of aged mice. 

- This TET2 gene mutation accounts for 42,500 cancers yearly in the United States.The new study, conducted at Perlmutter Cancer Center at New York University Langone Health and published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Cell, examined vitamin C’s potential to stimulate TET2 – and the results were encouraging.Genetically restoring TET2 blocks replication of cancer cells and safely kills themThe researchers found that intravenous high-dose vitamin C helps restore TET2 function, causing “faulty” stem cells in bone marrow to die off.Vitamin C produced results when it was used on human leukemia cells carrying the TET2 mutation – and it also stopped the growth of transplanted leukemia cancer stem cells in mice that had been genetically engineered to lack TET2.The vitamin achieved this effect by promoting DNA demethylation in the cancerous cells. 

- In fact, vitamin C seemed to have a potentiating effect, making the leukemic cells more vulnerable to the PARP inhibitors.Study author Benjamin Neel, Ph.D., noted that the team was excited by the prospect that high-dose vitamin C might become a “safe treatment for blood diseases caused by TET2-deficient leukemia stem cells, most likely in combination with other targeted therapies.” Neel called for preclinical and clinical trials to test high-dose intravenous vitamin C in human patients – and for further research to identify other substances that might help to potentiate the vitamin C treatment.Researchers are particularly hopeful that using vitamin C with cancer drugs could provide an alternative to toxic chemotherapy – which can be dangerous and even fatal to patients with acute myeloid leukemia.Note: The researchers used extremely high dosages of intravenous vitamin C in the study – amounts that would be impossible to obtain by oral ingestion alone.Amazing NEWS: Vitamin C has outperformed approved clinical and experimental drugsOther recent, peer-reviewed research is blazing exciting new inroads into the area of potential uses of this powerful vitamin to stop cancer.In a study newly published in Oncotarget, researcher found that high-dose vitamin C stopped tumors cold by impairing cancer stem cell metabolism and interfering with their ability to grow and spread.Researchers noted that the nutrient worked as a pro-oxidant in cancer cells – stripping them of the antioxidant glutathione and producing oxidative stress and apoptosis, or cell death.

The Government Assault Against Ivermectin and other Effective SARS-2 TreatmentsRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, September 1, 2021Had the FDA and Anthony Fauci’s National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease (NIAID) started approving existing clinically-proven and inexpensive drugs for treating malaria, parasites and other pathogens at the start of the pandemic, millions of people would have been saved from experiencing serious infections or dying from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 

- Why federal health officials never followed this strategy is a question the mainstream media refuses to ask.Another question that the medical establishment, let alone our compliant media, is why have they failed to ask whether there are reliable studies in the peer-reviewed literature and testimonies from thousands of day-to-day clinical physicians worldwide who treat Covid-19 patients with these drugs, in particular hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Ivermectin. 

- However, in the US, Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, the FDA and our federal medical officials have categorically denied their use. 

- It may be noted that various organizations and agencies in other nations, such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority in South Africa, which have banned ivermectin, are often funded by Gates. 

- It is naïve to believe that Gates has any philanthropic intentions whatsoever to see a highly effective treatment for SARS-2 infections reach worldwide approval. 

- Remdesivir’s average effectiveness for late stage treatment is only 22 percent. 

- A Chinese study published in The Lancet found no statistically significant benefit in the drug and 12 percent of participants taking the drug had to discontinue treatment due to serious adverse effects, especially liver and kidney damage.When questions are posited as a general argument for advocating expedient measures to protect public health during this pandemic, would it not have been wise to have prioritized for emergency use HCQ, Ivermectin, and other remedies with a record of curtailing Covid, such as the antibiotic azithromycin, zinc, selenium, Vitamins C and D, and melatonin as a first line of defense? 

- But this is what Fauci and Trump, and now Biden, permitted to happen.If this strategy of medical intervention had been followed, would it have been successful? 

- Yet those American physicians struggling to get this urgent message out to federal health officials are being marginalized and ridiculed en masse. 

- The World Health Organization recommends Ivermectin for Covid-19 so why not the US and these other nations? 

- Under oath, multiple physicians and professors at American medical schools have testified before Congress to present the scientific evidence supporting HCQ and Ivermectin. 

- These are otherwise medical professionals at the very heart of treating Covid-19 patients.Today, American journalism is in shambles. 

- Whether it is CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the liberal tabloid Daily Beast, NPR or PBS, each has unlimited resources to properly investigate the federal and institutional machinery behind the government health policies being thrust upon us. 

- Yet no mainstream journalist has found the moral compass to bring this truth to the public.In the meantime, we are allowing millions to die, and countless others to be seriously affected from a severe infection because of professional medical neglect and a healthcare system favoring the pharmaceutical industry’s frantic rush to develop expensive novel drugs and experimental vaccines. 

- Worldwide, it is not unreasonable to claim that billions of people have been treated with these drugs.Below is a breakdown of the studies conducted so far for HCQ, Ivermectin and Vitamin D specifically for combatting the SARS-CoV-2 virusHydroxychloroquine344 studies, 250 peer-reviewed have been conducted specifically for Covid-19281 have been clinical trials that involved 4,583 scientists and over 407,627 patients64% improvement in 31 early treatment trials75% improvement in 13 early stage infection treatment mortality results21% improvement in 190 late stage infection treatment trials (patients in serious condition)23% improvement in 44 randomized controlled trialsFull list of HCQ studies and details:  https://c19hcq.comIvermectin131 studies, 52 peer-reviewed have been conducted specifically for Covid-1963 have been clinical trials that involved 613 scientists and over 26,398 patients58% improvement in 31 randomized controlled trials86% improvement in 14 prophylaxis trials72% improvement in 27 early stage infection treatment trials40% improvement in 22 late stage infection treatment trials58% improvement in 25 mortality resultsFull list of Ivermectin studies and details:  https://c19ivermectin.comOther inexpensive repurposed drugs for treating SARS-2Fluvoxamine88% improvement in early treatment29% improvement in late stage treatment63% improvement in all 7 peer-reviewed studiesVitamin D101 studies conducted by over 875 scientists63 sufficiency studies with 34,863 patients33 treatment trials with 46,860 patients42% improvement in 33 treatment trials56% improvement in 68 sufficiency studies55% improvement in 19 treatment mortality resultsFull list of Vitamin D studies and details:  https://c19vitamind.comIn contrast there have been 21 studies enrolling 35,744 patients in Remdesivir trials showing only a 22% improvement in all studies combined.

- Those in the experimental group took 3 grams of pumpkin seed oil every day.Brachial and central blood pressure, wave reflection (augmentation index, AIx), arterial stiffness (SI) and various HRV parameters were measured at baseline and at the end of the study.Those who took pumpkin seed oil had significantly lower AIx, brachial and systolic blood pressure after treatment. 

- SI and HRV parameters remained unchanged for the treatment group and the placebo group at the end of the study.In sum, taking pumpkin seed oil may improve arterial hemodynamics in postmenopausal women.\Lack of exercise and poor nutrition could increase the risk of diseases like dementiaKings College London, August 23, 2021New research from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London has found that both diet and exercise can influence the risk of cognitive decline (CD) and dementia by potentially influencing hippocampal neurogenesis (the process by which the brain produces new brain cells) long before their onset.The study, published in Alzheimer’s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association, suggests that altered neurogenesis in the brain could potentially represent an early biomarker for both CD and dementia.The investigation studied how the blood of participants with and without CD and dementia could influence hippocampal neurogenesis in laboratory settings and whether diet and exercise were important factors. 

- The team also found that exercise, nutrition, vitamin D levels, carotenoid and lipid levels are all associated with the rate at which cells die off. 

- Furthermore, physical activity and nutrition were key factors that then also determined CD status. 

- Specifically, researchers found that reduced physical activity and increased malnutrition both increased cell death which in turn increased the risk for future CD.While previous studies have established that diet and exercise have some protective effects against CD and dementia, these roles have been poorly understood at the neurobiological level. 

- To date, studies on animals have shown how diet and exercise can directly influence hippocampal neurogenesis, potentially explaining how exercise and diet may biologically exert their effects, but this study sheds further light on this in the context of a human model.Dr. 

- Conversely, a decrease in levels of cell death during proliferation (the process by which a single cell divides into a pair) and reduced hippocampal progenitor cell integrity could be viewed as a predictor for Alzheimer’s Disease and Vascular dementia, respectively.”According to Alzheimer’s Research UK, there were a total of 525,315 people living with a dementia diagnosis in the UK in 2020. 

- Andrea du Preez, the study’s first author from King’s IoPPN said, “While more work is undoubtedly needed to fully understand how diet and exercise might modulate hippocampal neurogenesis, our findings may represent an effective early preventative strategy against CD and dementia.”Mindfulness may improve cognition in older adultsUniversity College London, August 23, 2021Mindfulness may provide modest benefits to cognition, particularly among older adults, finds a new review of evidence led by UCL researchers.The systematic review and meta-analysis, published in Neuropsychology Review, found that, while mindfulness is typically geared towards improving mental health and well-being, it may also provide additional benefits to brain health.The study’s lead author, PhD student Tim Whitfield (UCL Psychiatry) said that “the positive effects of mindfulness-based programs on mental health are already relatively well-established. 

- It might be easier to restore cognitive functions to previous levels, rather than to improve them beyond the developmental peak.”When they investigated which aspects of cognition were affected, the researchers found that mindfulness was beneficial only to executive function, and more specifically, there was strong evidence of a small positive effect on working memory (which is one facet of executive function).The researchers also analyzed whether mindfulness outperformed other ‘active interventions’ (such as brain training, relaxation, or other health or educational programs) or only when compared to people who were not offered any alternative treatment. 

- They found that cognitive benefits of mindfulness were only significant compared with an ‘inactive’ comparison, which means they cannot rule out that the benefits may have been at least partly derived from an expectation of treatment benefits, or social interactions.The researchers say that more research is needed into which characteristics of mindfulness training may be more likely to confer cognitive benefits, or whether delivering interventions over longer periods, or in intensive retreat settings, might yield greater cognitive benefits.Senior author Dr Natalie Marchant (UCL Psychiatry) said that they “know mindfulness-based programs benefit mental health, and our paper now suggests that mindfulness may also help to maintain cognitive faculties as people age. 

- Both of these have been used in clinical settings to establish the range of depressive symptoms and the severity of the diagnosis.After six weeks of treatment with either the standard pharmaceutical treatment or chlorella extract, the researchers found that those patients who had taken the chlorella had significantly reduced scores in both depression tests. 

- lying, fighting) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are the leading causes of child mental health referral in the UK. 

- These two disorders tend to occur in tandem (more than 40 per cent of children with a diagnosis of conduct disorder also have a diagnosis of ADHD) and can also be traced back to very similar prenatal experiences such as maternal distress or poor nutrition.In this new study of participants from the Bristol-based ‘Children of the 90s’ cohort, 83 children with early-onset conduct problems were compared with 81 children who had low levels of conduct problems. 

- The researchers assessed how the mothers’ nutrition affected epigenetic changes (or DNA methylation) of IGF2, a gene involved in fetal development and the brain development of areas implicated in ADHD – the cerebellum and hippocampus. 

- Notably, DNA methylation of IGF2 had previously been found in children of mothers who were exposed to famine in the Netherlands during World War II.The researchers from King’s and Bristol found that poor prenatal nutrition, comprising high fat and sugar diets of processed food and confectionary, was associated with higher IGF2 methylation in children with early onset conduct problems and those with low conduct problems.Higher IGF2 methylation was also associated with higher ADHD symptoms between the ages of 7 and 13, but only for children who showed an early onset of conduct problems.Dr Edward Barker from King’s College London said: ‘Our finding that poor prenatal nutrition was associated with higher IGF2 methylation highlights the critical importance of a healthy diet during pregnancy. 

- This is encouraging given that nutritional and epigenetic risk factors can be altered.’Dr Barker added: ‘We now need to examine more specific types of nutrition. 

- Green tea catechins include (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), well known for its anti-cancer and health-promoting effects, (-)-epicatechin, and many other similar molecules. 

- Worse than being ineffective, they point to negative health outcomes for the global population. 

- These two truth-telling acclaimed medical researchers make Fauci look as inept, deceitful and dangerous as he is.The point made in this article is not only has Fauci pushed the wrong potentially disastrous pandemic solution, he has blocked the right one.Much of what the two virologists say is very technical in nature. 

- The public needs to understand their warnings that refute all the propaganda pushing vaccines from government and public health agencies as well as big media.Warning: Keep reading and you may become depressed.*Dr. 

- These new virus variants will be more resistant to vaccination and may cause more health implications than their “original” versions.Montagnier refers to the mass vaccine program as an “unacceptable mistake” and are a “scientific error as well as a medical error.”  His assertion is that “The history books will show that…it is the vaccination that is creating the variants.”  In other words: “There are antibodies, created by the vaccine,” forcing the virus to “find another solution” or die. 

- ADE is a mechanism that increases the ability of a virus to enter cells and cause a worsening of the disease.Data from around the world confirms ADE occurs in SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, says Montagnier. 

- Therefore the hope of a ‘collective immunity’ by an increase in the number of vaccinated is totally futile.”On the positive side, he advocated this: “The early treatment of infection with ivermectin and bacterial antibiotic because there is a bacterial cofactor that amplifies the effects of the virus. 

- He believes that if the jabs are not halted, they could lead to the evolution of stronger and stronger variants of the virus until a “supervirus” takes hold and wipes out huge numbers of people.This is his bold view:“Given the huge amount of immune escape that will be provoked by mass vaccination campaigns and flanking containment measures, it is difficult to imagine how human interventions would not cause the COVID-19 pandemic to turn into an incredible disaster for global and individual health.”Here is an essential element of his thinking. 

- And all the contagion control measures simply to not work effectively enough to stop wide spread of the virus in its various forms.Here is his big picture view: “There is only one single thing at stake right now and that is the survival of our human race, frankly speaking.”But there are more strong words recently said by Bossche to pay attention to:“every person out there who is ‘partially’ or ‘fully’ vaccinated is a walking disease incubation system that puts everyone else at risk of contracting a deadly, vaccine-caused ‘variant’ that could kill them. 

- The ‘vaccinated’ are walking murderers spreading disease to others. 

- It is this; “This first critical step can only be achieved by calling an immediate halt to the mass vaccination program and replacing it by widespread use of antiviral chemoprophylactics while dedicating massive public health resources to scaling early multidrug treatments of Covid-19 disease.”  This is referring to the early home/outpatient treatment protocols based on cheap, safe and fully approved generics like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine; these also work as preventatives. 

- Pandemic Blunder provides much data and advice on using this treatment approach. 

- So, both virologists support use of what Fauci has blocked.These action recommendations were also made by Bossche “Provide – at no cost – early multidrug treatment to all patients in need. 

- Roll out campaigns to promote healthy diets and lifestyle.”  In other words, people need to take actions to boost their natural immunity, this should include vitamins and supplements, including this cocktail: vitamin C, vitamin D, zine and quercetin.ConclusionsTake a moment to consider that Patrick Wood on the Bannon show on August 21 concluded that all the available data from the US and Europe shows some 100,000 people have died from the COVID experimental vaccines. 

- Notably, the treatment protocols that so many great doctors have created and used to help their patients.Many other physicians and medical researchers have called for a halt to the current vaccine bonanza for big drug companies. 

- That is the insane world we are now experiencing even as more and people die from breakthrough infections, blood problems and other bad vaccine health impacts.Perhaps the ugly truth about the vaccines will be widely revealed only when there are massive, widespread deaths despite all the shots and jabs.

- The women are followed every two years by questionnaires on demographics, diet and lifestyle factors, and medical and other health-related information. 

- “Our results further support that vitamin D may be important in younger adults for health and possibly colorectal cancer prevention,” said Ng. 

- “It is critical to understand the risk factors that are associated with young-onset colorectal cancer so that we can make informed recommendations about diet and lifestyle, as well as identify high risk individuals to target for earlier screening.”The study was funded by grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense; by the American Cancer Society Mentored Research Scholar Grant; and by the Project P Fund.Ng’s disclosures include research funding from Pharmavite, Revolution Medicines, Janssen, and Evergrande Group; Advisory boards for Array Biopharma, Seattle Genetics, and BiomX; and consulting for X-Biotix Therapeutics.Lack of exercise and poor nutrition could increase the risk of diseases like dementiaKings College London, August 17, 2021New research from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London has found that both diet and exercise can influence the risk of cognitive decline (CD) and dementia by potentially influencing hippocampal neurogenesis (the process by which the brain produces new brain cells) long before their onset.The study, published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, suggests that altered neurogenesis in the brain could potentially represent an early biomarker for both CD and dementia.The investigation studied how the blood of participants with and without CD and dementia could influence hippocampal neurogenesis in laboratory settings and whether diet and exercise were important factors. 

- The team also found that exercise, nutrition, vitamin D levels, carotenoid and lipid levels are all associated with the rate at which cells die off. 

- Furthermore, physical activity and nutrition were key factors that then also determined CD status. 

- Specifically, researchers found that reduced physical activity and increased malnutrition both increased cell death which in turn increased the risk for future CD.While previous studies have established that diet and exercise have some protective effects against CD and dementia, these roles have been poorly understood at the neurobiological level. 

- To date, studies on animals have shown how diet and exercise can directly influence hippocampal neurogenesis, potentially explaining how exercise and diet may biologically exert their effects, but this study sheds further light on this in the context of a human model.Doctor Sandrine Thuret, the study’s lead investigator from King’s IoPPN said “Our study has demonstrated not only that there are individual markers of hippocampal neurogenesis associated with CD and dementia 12 years later, but also that there is some degree of specificity with respect to diagnoses of dementia subtypes.“Specifically, if an individual displays an increase in their levels of cell death during differentiation (when neural stem cells are becoming neurons), we can look at this as a potential warning sign of CD. 

- Conversely, a decrease in levels of cell death during proliferation (the process by which a single cell divides into a pair) and reduced hippocampal progenitor cell integrity could be viewed as a predictor for Alzheimer’s Disease and Vascular dementia, respectively.”According to Alzheimer’s Research UK, there were a total of 525,315 people living with a dementia diagnosis in the UK in 2020[1]. 

- Rates of cognitive decline and dementia are expected to triple in prevalence by 2040.Dr Andrea du Preez, the study’s first author from King’s IoPPN said, “While more work is undoubtedly needed to fully understand how diet and exercise might modulate hippocampal neurogenesis, our findings may represent an effective early preventative strategy against CD and dementia.”Acupuncture improves symptoms of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome compared to sham treatmentChina Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, August 17, 2021A multicenter randomized trial showed that 20 sessions of acupuncture over 8 weeks resulted in greater improvement in symptoms of moderate to severe chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) compared with sham therapy. 

- Treatment effects endured over 24 weeks follow up. 

- Antibiotics, a-blockers, and anti-inflammatories are the mainstays of treatment in clinical practice, but they have limited effectiveness and are associated with adverse events with long-term use. 

- Acupuncture has shown promise as an alternative treatment, but high-quality evidence is scarce.Researchers from the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences randomly assigned 440 male participants (220 in each group) to either 8 weeks of acupuncture or sham therapy to assess the long-term efficacy of acupuncture for improving symptoms of CP/CPPS. 

- The treatment was considered effective if participants achieved a clinically important reduction of at least 6 points from baseline on the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index at weeks 8 and 32. 

- No serious adverse events were reported in either group.According to the researchers, these findings show long-term efficacy of acupuncture and provide high-quality evidence for clinical practice and guideline recommendations.Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) decreases amyloid beta-induced neurotoxicity by decreasing neuroinflammation through regulation of microglial polarizationYunnan University (CHina), August 16, 2021According to news reporting originating in Yunnan, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Although the cause of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is still controversial, it is generally accepted that neuroinflammation plays a key role in AD pathogenesis. 

- Consistent with these findings, EPA significantly improved cognitive function and inhibited apoptotic neuronal death in the hippocampus.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “These results demonstrated that EPA appears to have potential effects on regulating microglial polarization, which contributes to alleviating neuroinflammation and may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating AD.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Yoga and meditation improve mind-body health and stress resilienceUniversity of Southern California  August 19, 2021Many people report positive health effects from practicing yoga and meditation, and experience both mental and physical benefits from these practices. 

- However, we still have much to learn about how exactly these practices affect mind-body health. 

- "An intriguing possible link between the effects on BDNF and the CAR is hippocampal functional integrity, since increased BDNF levels due to physical exercise has previously been shown to relate with hippocampal neurogenesis and likely relate to its positive effects on well-being and depression. 

- The next step will be to conduct further research in order to clarify the extent to which the positive changes on mind-body wellness and stress resilience are related to the yoga and meditation practices respectively, and to account for other possible contextual factors such as social dynamics, diet and the impact of the teacher.

- Curcumin: modulator of key molecular signaling pathways in hormone-independent breast cancerMonash University Malaysia, August 10, 2021According to news reporting originating from Selangor, Malaysia,  research stated, “Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide.”Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Monash University Malaysia: “Despite the overall successes in breast cancer therapy, hormone-independent HER2 negative breast cancer, also known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), lacking estrogens and progesterone receptors and with an excessive expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), along with the hormone-independent HER2 positive subtype, still remain major challenges in breast cancer treatment. 

- One of the most noteworthy phytochemicals, curcumin, has attracted enormous attention as a promising drug candidate in breast cancer prevention and treatment due to its multi-targeting effect. 

- The resulting CAR T cells are then infused back into the patient to find and attack cells that have the cancer antigens on their surface.This therapy has worked well for the treatment of some blood cancers and lymphoma, but not against solid tumors.

- While other scientists have found, in animal studies, that effects of endocrine disruptors can be passed down to future generations, this process has not been proved to occur in humans, he explained.More than 80,000 chemicals are registered for use in the U.S. in everyday items such as foods, personal care products, household cleaners and lawn-care products, according to the National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 

- While the program states on its website that relatively few chemicals are thought to pose a significant risk to human health, it also states: "We do not know the effects of many of these chemicals on our health. 

- "Cost and ethical issues, including the health risk of exposing human subjects to possibly harmful substances, are among the barriers to testing the safety of many chemicals. 

- As a result, numerous widely used compounds remain unevaluated in humans for their health effects, especially to the hormone system. 

- There is currently no cure for the degenerative condition and medical treatments often have side effects such as vomiting, loss of appetite, and muscle pains. 

- Now, researchers say patients can greatly benefit from a type of treatment that doesn’t come with such downsides and helps their brain avoid additional decline.A new study suggests that mixing with other people helps dementia patients stay sharp and fend off depression. 

- Scientists say the type of treatment known as “cognitive stimulation” could make living with dementia easier for hundreds of thousands of people.“Dementia is one of the biggest global challenges that we face,” says senior author Dr. Claudia von Bastian, of the University of Sheffield, in a statement. 

- “Our research highlights that cognitive stimulation can be a safe, relatively cheap, and accessible treatment to help reduce some of the core symptoms of dementia and may even alleviate symptoms of depression.”The researchers analyzed the use of cognitive stimulation as an effective treatment for people with dementia. 

- We’ve seen far more energy and resources put into developing initiatives to support this, such as cognitive stimulation, which is now used widely across the world,” notes co-author Dr. Ben Hicks, of Brighton and Sussex Medical School.“We still need to learn more about the key ingredients of cognitive stimulation which lead to these benefits and how they influence the progression of dementia. 

- However, the absence of negative side-effects and the low costs of this treatment means the benefits are clear,” adds Dr. von Bastian.More research is needed to determine whether cognitive stimulation and other non-pharmaceutical treatments could help the growing number of people who suffer fromdementia.“Our research is the first to comprehensively interrogate the evidence base for its effectiveness, using the most up-to-date statistical techniques.

- They investigated whether people who ate more foods containing vitamin K had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease related to atherosclerosis (plaque build-up in the arteries).There are two types of vitamin K found in foods we eat: vitamin K1 comes primarily from green leafy vegetables and vegetable oils while vitamin K2 is found in meat, eggs and fermented foods such as cheese.The study found that people with the highest intakes of vitamin K1 were 21 percent less likely to be hospitalized with cardiovascular disease related to atherosclerosis.For vitamin K2, the risk of being hospitalized was 14 percent lower.This lower risk was seen for all types of heart disease related to atherosclerosis, particularly for peripheral artery disease at 34 percent.ECU researcher and senior author on the study Dr. Nicola Bondonno said the findings suggest that consuming more vitamin K may be important for protection against atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease. 

- "University of Western Australia researcher Dr. Jamie Bellinge, the first author on the study, said the role of vitamin K in cardiovascular health and particularly in vascular calcification is an area of research offering promising hope for the future. 

- "Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in Australia and there's still a limited understanding of the importance of different vitamins found in foodand their effect on heart attacks, strokes and peripheral artery disease," Dr. Bellinge said.

- While the dangers of being obese on physical health is well known, researchers are now discovering that being overweight can also have a significant impact on mental health.The new study, published in Human Molecular Genetics, sought to investigate why a body of evidence now indicates that higher BMI causes depression. 

- Such conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.In research led by the University of Exeter and funded by the Academy of Medical Sciences, the team examined genetic data from more than 145,000 participants from the UK Biobank with detailed mental health data available. 

- In a multifaceted study, the researchers analyzed genetic variants linked to higher BMI, as well as outcomes from a clinically-relevant mental health questionnaire designed to assess levels of depression, anxiety and wellbeing.To examine which pathways may be active in causing depression in people with higher BMI, the team also interrogated two sets of previously discovered genetic variants. 

- The team found little difference between the two sets of genetic variants, indicating that both physical and social factors play a role in higher rates of depression and poorer wellbeing.Lead author Jess O'Loughlin, at the University of Exeter Medical School, said: "Obesity and depression are both major global health challenges, and our study provides the most robust evidence to date that higher BMI causes depression. 

- Understanding whether physical or social factors are responsible for this relationship can help inform effective strategies to improve mental health and wellbeing. 

- Our research suggests that being fatter leads to a higher risk of depression, regardless of the role of metabolic health. 

- This suggests that both physical health and social factors, such as social stigma, both play a role in the relationship between obesity and depression. 

- "Lead author Dr. Francesco Casanova, of the University of Exeter Medical School, said, "This is a robust study, made possible by the quality of UK Biobank data.

- Cocoa flavanols contribute to faster oxygen uptake kinetics, improved blood flowLiverpool Hope University, August 4, 2021A bioactive compound found in cocoa powder and dark chocolate could help middle-aged adults enjoy exercise, a new study has suggested. 

- The research analyzed the potential health benefits of cocoa flavanols, a plant nutrient extracted from cocoa beans.Cocoa flavanols are found in abundance in cocoa powder, and to a lesser extent in dark chocolate, and can be consumed as a supplement. 

- Because cocoa flavanols have a 'vasodilatory' effect, helping to increase blood flow, they've been shown to prevent blood clots and even combat memory decline.Now, a team of scientists from Liverpool Hope University and Liverpool John Moores University have tested the effects of cocoa flavanols when it comes to exercise in a group of sedentary adults aged between 40 and 60 years old.And the report found that cocoa flavanols contribute to faster oxygen uptake kinetics—with improved blood flow the likely cause.Associate Professor Simon Marwood, subject lead in sport science at Liverpool Hope University, says the findings could be important when it comes to convincing people to get off the sofa and then stick with an exercise program. 

- He said: "One barrier to starting an exercise plan is poor fitness in the first place, perhaps because of the discomfort associated with what might otherwise be light exercise. 

- "Without frequent exercise, aging results in a slowing in the rate at which our oxygen consumption increases at the onset of exercise. 

- This is due to impairments in the ability to supply blood to the exercising muscles at the onset of exercise. 

- "In previous studies, we have shown that this slowing of the rate of increase of oxygen consumption has a direct and inhibiting effect on the ability to tolerate exercise. 

- "The finding of faster increases in oxygen consumption at the onset of exercise with cocoa flavanols supplementation is therefore really encouraging for this age group since it suggests that a simple nutritional supplement can improve exercise tolerance, and therefore enhance the likelihood of sustaining an exercise program. 

- "Lead author Daniel Sadler, of Liverpool John Moores' School of Sport and Exercise Science, concludes: "These novel effects of cocoa flavanols in this demographic may contribute to improved tolerance of moderate-activity physical activities, which appear commonly present in daily life. 

- And the substance is most commonly available as a supplement, which is often used by amateur athletes to boost performance.The research itself focused on a group of healthy, middle-aged men and women with an average age of 45 years old and who typically engaged in less than two hours of structured exercise training per week.Over a period of five weeks, prior to consuming the cocoa supplement, the group was put through a series of trials, using a lab-based exercise bike, where they were incrementally pushed to exhaustion. 

- These trials were performed in order to establish a person's VO2 peak, the maximum amount of oxygen the body can use during exercise, as well as power output.The test subjects were then given either a daily 400 mg cocoa flavanol supplement or a placebo over the course of seven days.And at the end of that week, they got back on the cycle ergometers and took part in a series of step exercise tests, where they started pedaling at a baseline before the load was ramped up to either moderate or severe-intensity work rates.The key measurement being analyzed was pulmonary VO2 kinetics, or τVO2, the time it takes for oxygen delivery to respond to the demands of exercise.The shorter the response time, the better equipped someone is to tolerate the given exercise.And what the research team discovered was that when the test subjects who'd consumed the cocoa flavanols were subjected to 'moderate' exercise, the VO2 kinetics time was 'significantly reduced' from around 40 seconds to 34 seconds.This reduction of six seconds is important, the team states, because it exceeds the minimum physiologically relevant change of around 5 seconds.The scientists add: "The reduction in τVO2 observed after cocoa flavanol supplementation in our middle-aged individuals reflects a shift toward values typically observed in younger healthy individuals. 

- "Flavonoids aren't just found in cocoa—they're also abundant in green tea, fruit and vegetables—and have anti-inflammatory as well as antioxidant properties.Liverpool John Moores' Daniel Sadler says you shouldn't rely on eating dark chocolate to get an effective dose of flavanols.He explains: "It is preferable to take supplements over eating dark chocolate since potential beneficial effects of cocoa flavanols occur during exercise when high doses are consumed—greater than 400 mg flavanols—and because dark chocolate contains fat and sugar that may negate the beneficial potential of any bioactive constituents. 

- "Vitamin D reduces the need for opioids in palliative cancerKarolinska Institute (Sweden), August 4, 2021Patients with vitamin D deficiency who received vitamin D supplements had a reduced need for pain relief and lower levels of fatigue in palliative cancer treatment, a randomized and placebo-controlled study by researchers at Karolinska Institutet shows. 

- The study is published in the scientific journal Cancers.Among patients with cancer in the palliative phase, vitamin D deficiency is common.Previous studies have shown that low levels of vitamin D in the blood may be associated with pain, sensitivity to infection, fatigue, depression, and lower self-rated quality of life.A previous smaller study, which was not randomized or placebo-controlled, suggested that vitamin D supplementation could reduce opioid doses, reduce antibiotic use, and improve the quality of life in patients with advanced cancer.244 cancer patients with palliative cancer, enrolled in ASIH, (advanced medical home care), took part in the current study in Stockholm during the years 2017-2020.Slower increase in opiod dosesAll study participants had a vitamin D deficiency at the start of the study. 

- They received either 12 weeks of treatment with vitamin D at a relatively high dose (4000 IE/day) or a placebo.The researchers then measured the change in opioid doses (as a measurement of pain) at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the start of the study. 

- "The results showed that vitamin D treatment was well tolerated and that the vitamin D-treated patients had a significantly slower increase in opioid doses than the placebo group during the study period. 

- This is the first time it has been shown that vitamin D treatment for palliative cancer patients can have an effect on both opioid-sensitive pain and fatigue," says first author of the study Maria Helde Frankling, senior physician at ASIH and postdoc at the Department of Neurobiology, Healthcare Science and Society, Karolinska Institutet.The study is one of the largest drug studies conducted within ASIH in Sweden. 

- And while studies show that decline in cognitive (mental) skills can emerge up to 15 years before death, it’s not clear whether the same is true for physical abilities.To explore this further, researchers examined several measures of motor function for their associations with mortality over a 10 year period from around age 65.Their findings are based on over 6,000 participants of the Whitehall II Study, which recruited participants aged 35-55 years in 1985-88 to look at the impact of social, behavioural, and biological factors on long term health.Between 2007 and 2016, participants underwent motor function assessments on up to three occasions. 

- “Despite the focus on death as an outcome in these analyses, our goal should always be to add life to years, not just years to life.”Researchers propose new treatment to prevent kidney stones – HCA in Garcinia CambogiaUniversity of Houston, August 8, 2021Researchers have found evidence that a natural fruit extract is capable of dissolving calcium oxalate crystals, the most common component of human kidney stones. 

- This finding could lead to the first advance in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones in 30 years.Jeffrey Rimer, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Houston, was lead author of the study, published Aug. 8 in the online edition of Nature. 

- High blood pressure, diabetes and obesity can increase the risk, and the reported incidence is on the rise.Preventive treatment has not changed much over the last three decades. 

- They often recommend taking citrate (CA), in the form of potassium citrate, a supplement that can slow crystal growth, but some people are unable to tolerate the side effects.The project grew out of preliminary work done by collaborator John Asplin, a nephrologist at Litholink Corporation, who suggested HCA as a possible treatment. 

- They discovered HCA formed a stronger bond with crystal surfaces, inducing a strain that is seemingly relieved by the release of calcium and oxalate, leading to crystal dissolution.HCA was also tested in human subjects, as seven people took the supplement for three days, allowing researchers to determine that HCA is excreted through urine, a requirement for the supplement to work as a treatment.While Rimer said the research established the groundwork to design an effective drug, questions remain. 

- "If it works in vivo, similar to our trials in the laboratory, HCA has the potential to reduce the incidence rate of people with chronic kidney stone disease. 

- "Prolonged treatment with gotu kola improved memory, reduced amyloid beta pathology and activated antioxidant response pathwayOregon Health & Science University, August 4, 2021According to news reporting out of Portland, Oregon, research stated, “The medicinal herb Centella asiatica has been long been used for its neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing effects. 

- We have previously shown that two weeks of treatment with a water extract of Centella asiatica (CAW) improves cognition and activates the endogenous antioxidant response pathway without altering amyloid-beta (A beta) plaque burden.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), “Here, we assess the effect of long-term treatment of CAW in the 5xFAD mouse model of A beta accumulation. 

- Three months of treatment with CAW improved spatial and contextual memory as well as executive function in 5xFAD mice. 

- In isolated neurons, treatment with ML385 blocked the effects of CAW on dendritic arborization and synaptic gene expression. 

- These results suggest that prolonged CAW exposure could be beneficial in Alzheimer’s disease and that these effects likely involve NRF2 activation.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Moreover, these findings suggest that targeting NRF2 itself may be a relevant therapeutic strategy for improving synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Resveratrol: The key to reducing elderly frailty?Universidad Pablo de Olavide (Spain) , August 9, 2021The so-called red wine nutrient resveratrol may help maintain muscle performance and reduce frailty in the elderly, research in mice has suggested.Using 48 young, mature and old mice models, the study found resveratrol improved muscle performance in the mature and old animals but not in the young.They found resveratrol – found in grapes, red wine, walnuts, peanuts and berries – “primed” the effect of exercise by increasing endurance, coordination and strength in the old animals as well as providing higher protection against oxidative damage and an increase in the mitochondrial mass responsible for the energy-generating process essential for cell metabolism.“Our results indicate that resveratrol can be considered an ergogenic compound that helps maintain muscle performance during ageing and subsequently reduces frailty and increases muscle performance in old individuals practising moderate exercise,” wrote the researchers from Universidad Pablo de Olavide in Seville, Spain and the Vietnam National University in Hanoi, Vietnam.Study detailsEach experiment group animal was given a daily dose of about 500 μg of resveratrol for 4.5 months. 

- After this period the mice were randomly divided again into sedentary and trained groups.The trained mice were adapted to exercise then put on a rodent treadmill for 20 minutes per day, five days a week for six weeks.The animals were then killed by cervical dislocation and the gastrocnemius muscle was quickly removed.Old polyphenol, young resultsDiscussing the results, lead author and professor at the Universidad Pablo de Olavide Dr Guillermo Lopez-Lluch told us while this was not the first time the polyphenol had been looked at within health ageing, this was the first time it had been associated with the improvement of muscle capacity in ageing.Asked if the results meant older people should be recommended or even prescribed resveratrol, Professor Lopez-Lluch said: “The use of nutraceuticals such as resveratrol can be recommended in the case of poor diets lacking fresh vegetables rich in polyphenols.“In aged people an unbalanced diet must be supplemented with extracts rich in these compounds accompanied by a more active life.”In 2011 research in Italy estimated between 11–50% of over 80s suffer from age-related muscle loss sarcopenia, with the problem particularly prevalent in care homes.“Maintenance of muscle functionality is important to avoid frailty and to increase the independence and quality of life during ageing. 

- It seems clear that for daily life activity, and hence a good quality of life, not only strength but also endurance is needed,” the researchers wrote in the British Journal of Nutrition.“Apart from the maintenance of a series of basic exercises, several nutritional bioactive compounds have been proposed to increase muscle function during ageing and to avoid sarcopenia.”The researchers said the "most controversial problem" with identifying effects of bioactive compounds was to find if the positive effects found in preclinical studies in animals produced the same response in humans. 

- "Yet Professor Lopez-Lluch said his research team did not have plans to study this effect of resveratrol in humans.Instead they were currently awaiting funds to carry out a study about exercise, quality of nutrition and quality of life in elderly people.“We hope this study will get a grant in the next months.”

Eating a plant-based diet can help protect against COVID-19, researchers findHarvard University and Kings College London, August 2, 2021People who eat a plant-based diet are less likely to contract COVID-19 and become severely ill with the disease, according to a recent study by researchers from Harvard Medical School, King’s College London and the health science company ZOE.The researchers analyzed data from over 590,000 people from the United States and the United Kingdom who answered a survey about the foods they ate last February using the ZOE COVID Symptom Study application. 

- The application allows users to record their symptoms in case of COVID-19 infection and to log when they’ve had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.By early December 2020, 19 percent of the users who participated contracted COVID-19 based on positive PCR test results and symptoms reported via the application.“For the first time, we’ve been able to show that a healthier diet can cut the chances of developing [COVID-19],” said co-author Sarah Berry, a senior lecturer in nutritional sciences at King’s College London.A preprint of the study was released online in medRxiv.A promising new treatment for COVID-19 infection - Nigella sativaby  University of Technology, SydneyA flowering plant native to North Africa and Western Asia could be utilized in the future treatment of COVID-19 infection.The seeds of the plant, Nigella sativa, have been used for centuries as a traditional remedy for multiple medical conditions, including inflammation and infections. 

- The findings, published in Nature, could help researchers develop new ways to treat chronic inflammation and bacterial disease. 

- When stressed, people are quicker to jump to the worst conclusionUniversity College London, July 29, 2021When under stress, people reach undesirable conclusions based on weaker evidence than when they are relaxed, finds a new study led by UCL researchers.The findings, published today in the Journal of Neuroscience, show that stress can make people more likely to conclude the worst scenario is true.Senior author Professor Tali Sharot (UCL Psychology & Language Sciences and Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research) said: "Many of the most significant choices you will make, from financial decisions to medical and professional ones, will happen while you feel stressed. 

- For example, you may consult multiple physicians before deciding on a best course of medical treatment. 

- "Thai Cabinet Approves Use of Fah Talai Jone (green chiretta) to Treat Asymptomatic COVID-19 CasesBangkok Post, July 22, 2021Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has instructed authorities to set up a committee to study the use of green chiretta (Andrographis paniculata) extracts to treat Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms.The announcement was made at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, which was convened to discuss additional measures to help curb the Covid-19 outbreak, the premier said on Wednesday.Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul was appointed head of the committee.It will coordinate studies on the safety and efficacy of green chiretta extracts on Covid-19 patients, as well as draft a strategic plan to promote Thai traditional medicine in general.The decision was taken in response to a proposal from Justice Minister Somsak Thepsutin, who urged the government to scale up the use of traditional medicines on Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms. 

- This comes amid a vaccine shortage which has led to criticism for the government.His proposal came with evidence showing the Department of Corrections' success in treating 12,376 inmates who were infected with Covid-19 with green chiretta extracts.Of this number, 5,045 inmates were in Chiang Mai Central Prison, 2,100 in Nonthaburi Provincial Prison and 5,231 in Bang Kwang Central Prison also in Nonthaburi, said Mr Somsak.Before prescribing the herbal medicine to infected inmates, Mr Somsak said he had studied information by the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine, which recommended a dosage of 180mg of andrographolides from green chiretta for five consecutive days to patients with mild symptoms.Citing the same research, the minister said each rai of land can yield up to 600kg of green chirettas, which can be turned into roughly 375,000 herbal extract capsules, he said.A total of 3.1 billion such capsules will be needed to cover all Thais, which means 8,400 rai of land will need to be planted with the herb, he said.The Department of Corrections now plans to produce about 50 million capsules of the herbal medicine in the next four months, which it aims to prescribe to about 50% of the prison population, he said.Due to its medical benefits, green chiretta has become a cash crop which is now in high demand in the export sector, he said.Mr Somsak added that the medicinal herb costs about 450 baht per kgTaking breaks while learning improves memoryMax Planck Institute of Neurobiology (Germany), July 29, 2021We remember things longer if we take breaks during learning, referred to as the spacing effect. 

- Hopefully, we won't have forgotten this by the time we take our next exam!The flavonoid epicatechin inhibits progressive tau pathology in Alzheimer'sUniversity of Bath (UK), July 23, 2021According to news reporting originating in Avon, United Kingdom, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, “Aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau into paired helical filaments (PHFs) and neurofibrillary tangles is a defining characteristic of Alzheimer’s Disease. 

- Furthermore, EC did not significantly inhibit GSK3 beta activity at physiologically-relevant concentrations in a cell free assay.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “Therefore, a 21-day intervention with EC inhibits or reverses the development of tau pathology in rTg4510 mice independently of direct inhibition of GSK3 beta.”Fruit compound may have potential to prevent and treat Parkinson's diseaseJohns Hopkins University, July 29, 2021Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers say they have added to evidence that the compound farnesol, found naturally in herbs, and berries and other fruits, prevents and reverses brain damage linked to Parkinson's disease in mouse studies.he compound, used in flavorings and perfume-making, can prevent the loss of neurons that produce dopamine in the brains of mice by deactivating PARIS, a key proteininvolved in the disease's progression. 

- Loss of such neurons affects movement and cognition, leading to hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's disease such as tremors, muscle rigidity, confusion and dementia. 

- Farnesol's ability to block PARIS, say the researchers, could guide development of new Parkinson's disease interventions that specifically target this protein. 

- "Our experiments showed that farnesol both significantly prevented the loss of dopamine neurons and reversed behavioral deficits in mice, indicating its promise as a potential drug treatment to prevent Parkinson's disease," says Ted Dawson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering and professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.Results of the new study, published July 28, in Science Translational Medicine, detail how the researchers identified farnesol's potential by screening a large library of drugs to find those that inhibited PARIS.In the brains of people with Parkinson's disease, a buildup of PARIS slows down the manufacture of the protective protein PGC-1alpha. 

- Without PGC-1alpha, dopamine neurons die off, leading to the cognitive and physical changes associated with Parkinson's disease.To study whether farnesol could protect brains from the effects of PARIS accumulation, the researchers fed mice either a farnesol-supplemented diet or a regular mouse diet for one week. 

- Then, the researchers administered pre-formed fibrils of the protein alpha-synuclein, which is associated with the effects of Parkinson's disease in the brain.The researchers found that the mice fed the farnesol diet performed better on a strength and coordination test designed to detect advancement of Parkinson's disease symptoms. 

- The researchers caution that safe doses of farnesol for humans have not yet been determined, and that only carefully controlled clinical trials can do so.Though more research is needed, Dawson and his team hope farnesol can someday be used to create treatments that prevent or reverse brain damage caused by Parkinson's disease.Plant compounds reveal anticancer mechanismsRussian Academy of Sciences, July 28 2021.Research published on June 9, 2021 in Scientific Reportsexplored mechanisms involved in the cancer protective effects of 30 compounds derived from fruits and vegetables. 

- The researchers hope that their findings will contribute to the formulation of new drugs that will have fewer side effects than drugs currently in use.“To create potent new drugs that will target only the tumor, it was necessary to determine how dietary compounds affect cell proteins in the prevention and treatment of cancer,” explained coauthor Grigory Zyryanov, who is a professor at the Russian Academy of Sciences. 

- “However, we have [previously] shown that individuals at genetic risk of developing depression in the context of the immune challenge, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), have lower levels of RBCs n3-PUFAs, and that n-3 PUFAs supplementation prevents the onset of IFN-alpha-induced depression, arguably by replenishing the endogenously low anti-inflammatory PUFAs in the ‘at risk’ individuals.”

Lawsuit at the US Dept Human Health Services over Intentional Misreporting of Covid vaccine deaths and injuriesAna Garner is an attorney who has been practicing law in New Mexico for 40 years. 

- Later her experience in medical litigation earned her a position at the university's law school. 

- Following graduation Ana pursued a law practice in medical malpractice and injuries. 

- Last December, she and three other attorneys filed a case against New Mexico's governor and state public health officials on the handling of Covid pandemic. 

- She is also a member of a legal team representing America's Frontline Doctors in a lawsuit filed in Alabama against the US Department of Health and Human Services for grossly misreporting and misrepresenting the number of deaths from deaths following vaccination with the Covid vaccines. 

- Five are considered unhealthy: red meat, butter and stick margarine, cheese, pastries, sweets and fried/fast foods.Researchers examined information from 5,907 older adults who participated in the Health and Retirement Study. 

- What's more, older adults who followed these healthy diets had lower risks for having cognitive impairment in later life, noted the researchers.Postmenopausal women can dance their way to better healthNew study suggests that dancing improves cholesterol levels, physical fitness, self-image, and self-esteem in postmenopausal womenNorth American Menopause Society, July 28, 2021Women often struggle with managing their weight and other health risk factors, such as high cholesterol, once they transition through menopause. 

- As a result of all these changes, postmenopausal women often suffer from decreased self-image and self-esteem, which are directly related to overall mental health.Physical activity has been shown to minimize some of the many health problems associated with menopause. 

- In addition to these benefits, women also probably enjoyed a sense of comradery from the shared experience of learning something new,” says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, NAMS medical director.Impact of vitamin D on response to anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy in children with inflammatory bowel diseaseMassachusetts General Hospital for Children, July 20, 2021According to news reporting originating in Boston, Massachusetts, research stated, “Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D has an immunomodulatory effect on the innate and adaptive immune systems. 

- Associations between vitamin D deficiency and development or progression of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are reported, but a cause-and-effect relationship between pretreatment 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and response to anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF) therapy is not established.”The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from MassGeneral Hospital for Children, “This retrospective study evaluated pediatric IBD patients who had 25(OH)D levels drawn within 3 months of initiating infliximab and/or adalimumab treatment. 

- Demographic features, Paris classification, baseline 25(OH)D levels, disease activity, and laboratory results before and after 3 months of anti-TNF therapy were collected. 

- Sixty-five patients (85.5%) had Crohn disease (CD) and 11 (14.5%) had ulcerative colitis.

CoQ10 supplementation associated with improved trauma patient outcomesUrmia University of Medical Sciences (Iran) July 23 2021.Findings from a trial reported on July 12, 2021 in the Journal of Nutritional Science revealed benefits for hospitalized traumapatients who were given supplements that contained coenzyme Q10.The trial enrolled 40 men and women with traumatic injury and low plasma levels of CoQ10. 

- The primary outcome variable was the change in serum level of 25(OH)D, while the secondary outcomes were the medical state of the assigned cases (improvement or death) and duration between enrollment and hospital discharge for improved cases. 

- "The data suggest that being more physically active could reduce two of the more commonly reported symptoms in breast cancer survivors: fatigue and cognitive impairment," said study leader Edward McAuley, a professor of kinesiology and community health at Illinois. 

- "Most people think, 'If I exercise, I'll become tired.' 

- In our study, exercise actually was associated with reduced fatigue, which in turn was associated with better cognitive function. 

- Past Illinois research has explored the effect of physical fitness on age-related cognitive decline, so the researchers wondered whether cancer survivors would respond similarly to exercise. 

- "Other studies of cancer survivors have relied on small samples of cancer survivors, and used self-reporting measures of physical activity and cognitive function, which can be very biased," said postdoctoral researcher Diane Ehlers, the first author of the study, which is published in the journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment. 

- "Next, the researchers plan to conduct further studies to establish causation and further explore the pathways of how physical exercise improves cognitive performance. 

- "Cannabidiol promotes oral ulcer healing by inactivating CMPK2-mediated NLRP3 inflammasomeSichuan University (China), July 26, 2021Xingying Qi, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, presented the oral session "Cannabidiol Promotes Oral Ulcer Healing by Inactivating CMPK2-Mediated NLRP3 Inflammasome" at the virtual 99th General Session & Exhibition of the International Association for Dental Research (IADR), held in conjunction with the 50th Annual Meeting of the American Association for Dental Research (AADR) and the 45th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Association for Dental Research (CADR), on July 21-24, 2021.The oral ulcer is a common oral inflammatory lesion with severe pain but little effective treatment is currently available. 

- “Furthermore, the supplementation with Spirulina reduces several hepatic inflammatory and oxidative stress markers that are upregulated in old mice versus young mice.”Expression of several genetic and biochemical markers of inflammation and immunity were altered by supplementation with Spirulina, said the team.In particular, the transcription factor Foxp3 – involved in the differentiation of T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs) – and MCP1 were increased due to Spirulina supplementation in old mice.Old mice that consumed Spirulina also showed activation of several immune parameters including Foxp3 in the ileum – suggesting an improvement of the gut immune function upon Spirulina treatment in this segment, said the Belgian researchers. 

- Its author, journalist Jennifer Kahn, takes readers who would have little to no understanding of genetic engineering and genetically modified organisms (GMO) through a fictional labyrinth of out-dated and conflated GMO similitudes to an end point where readers might believe GMOs are really cool and there is nothing to be frantically worried about.Kahn spins the story of Cathie Martin’s research to develop a genetically engineered purple tomato high in the anti-oxidant anthocyacin as the work of a solo humanitarian to improve consumers’ health by providing nutrient-rich GMO produce. 

- The early acceptance of GMOs was largely based upon the unproven hypothesis of “substantial equivalence.” The USDA’s adoption of this concept during Bill Clinton’s first term in the White House gave GM seed companies a free pass to avoid submitting trial evidence to prove the environmental and health safety of genetically modified crops. 

- However, in Kahn’s recent essay, she attempts to shift attention away from the early generation of GMOs, which were engineered solely to sell more toxic pesticides, and emphasize GMO’s potential for increasing nutritional health and to advance medicine. 

- “We may feel OK about rearranging genes, the way nature does, but we’re not comfortable mixing them up between creatures.”But most disturbing is Kahn’s failure to make any mention o the trail of environmental disasters and disease risks due to consuming genetically modified foods. 

- Despite her pro-GMO advocacy, if Kahn’s conscience had led her to take a moral high road, she could have at least apologized on Monsanto’s behalf for the trail of death and disease the company’s glyphosate has left in its wake. 

- To date Monsanto’s glyphosate poisoning has been identified with the suppression of essential gut enzymes and amino acid synthesis, gluten intolerance, disruption of manganese pathways, neurological disease, cancer, amyloidosis and autoimmune disease. 

- Her New York Times article would have better served the improvement of public health as a warning rather than an applause to appease companies such as Bayer/Monsanto and Syngenta. 

- As for its risks to health, GM Watch in the UK points out the work conducted by David Schubert at the Salk Institute that the rice might potentially generate Vitamin A derivatives that could “damage human fetuses and cause birth defects.”Kahn, who should be acknowledged as a highly respected science journalist and teaches journalism at the University of California’s Berkeley campus, happens to be a contributing author for the Genetic Literacy Project (GLP) at the University of California at Davis, a public relations operation sponsored by the agro-chemical industry. 

- GLP and its east coast partner, Cornell University’s Alliance for Science, largely funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, serve as the GMO industry’s clearing houses for public relations to spin science into advertising, propaganda and character assassination of GM opponents.The Genetic Literacy Project is a key collaborator with another food industry front organization, the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH). 

- ACSH has nothing to do with actual health science. 

- It has been described by the independent corporate financial watchdog organization Sourcewatch as a thinly veiled corporate front that holds “a generally apologetic stance regarding virtually every other health and environmental hazard produced by modern industry, accepting corporate funding from Coca-Cola, Syngenta, Proctor Gamble, Kellogg, General Mills, Pepsico, and the American Beverage Association, among others.” ACSH also favors toxic pesticides, the use of biphenol A in products, cigarettes and hydrofracking. 

- It is closely aligned with pseudo-medical front organizations that criticize alternative and natural health modalities, such as Quackwatch and the Science Based Medicine network.GLP sources a couple thousand corporate-friendly studies favoring GMO safety. 

- Furthermore, other studies in Nicolia’s collection conclude the exact opposite of their intention and give further credibility to GMOs environmental and animal and human health risks. 

- Mark Lynas was specifically named in the document alongside then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan as a prime candidate to pressure European agencies who were skeptical about GMO claims, promises and health and environmental risks. 

- This has been one of Lynas’ pet arguments on his bully pulpit since turning traitor on his former Greenpeace activists and joining Monsanto’s legions.It may also be noted that Jennifer Kahn is an active participant in CRISPRcon, a forum dedicated to “the future of CRISPR and gene editing technology applications in agriculture, health, conservation and more.” Among the organization’s supporters are Bayer, the Innovative Genomics Institute, Cornell Alliance for Science, Corteva Agriscience and the United Soybean Board. 

- In 2018, the Pew Research Center reported that only five percent of Americans said GM foods were better for one’s health – which about makes up the number of people who are in one way or another invested in the agrichemical industry. 

- Still over half believe they endanger health. 

- Red and processed meat linked to increased risk of heart disease, study showsOxford University, July 21, 2021Globally, coronary heart diseases (caused by narrowed arteries that supply the heart with blood) claim nearly nine million lives each year1, the largest of any disease, and present a huge burden to health systems. 

- Until now, it has been unclear whether eating meat increases the risk of heart disease, and if this varies for different kinds of meat.Researchers at the University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Population Health have conducted the largest systematic review of the prospective evidence to date, including thirteen cohort studies involving over 1.4 million people. 

- The study participants completed detailed dietary assessments, and their health was tracked for up to 30 years. 

- The results are published today in Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition.Overall, the evidence from the analysis indicated that:Each 50 g/day higher intake of processed meat (e.g. 

- bacon, ham, and sausages) increased the risk of coronary heart disease by 18%.Each 50 g/day higher intake of unprocessed red meat (such as beef, lamb and pork) increased the risk of coronary heart disease by 9%.There was no clear link between eating poultry (such as chicken and turkey) and an increased risk of coronary heart disease.The findings may be because of the high content of saturated fat in red meat, and of sodium (salt) in processed meat. 

- Both LDL cholesterol and high blood pressure are well-established risk factors for coronary heart disease.Previous work from the same research team has also indicated that even moderate intakes of red and processed meat are associated with increased risk of bowel cancer2.Dr. 

- Keren Papier (Nuffield Department of Population Health), co-lead author of the study, said: "Red and processed meat have been consistently linked with bowel cancer and our findings suggest an additional role in heart disease. 

- Therefore, current recommendations to limit red and processed meat consumption may also assist with the prevention of coronary heart disease."Dr. 

- Anika Knüppel, from the Nuffield Department of Population Health and the other co-lead author of the study, added: "We know that meat production is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and we need to reduce meat production and thereby consumption to benefit the environment. 

- Our study shows that a reduction in red and processed meat intake would bring personal health benefits too. 

- "Currently in the UK, about 10 in 100 people would be expected to eventually die from coronary heart disease. 

- Based on the findings from the present study and current red and processed meat intakes in the UK,4 if all these 100 people reduced their unprocessed red meat intake by three-quarters (for example from four times a week to one time a week), or if they stopped consuming processed meat altogether, deaths from coronary heart disease would decrease from 10 in 100 down to 9 in 100.The studies involved in this analysis were mostly based on white adults living in Europe or the U.S.. 

- "We hope that these kinds of induced Tregs can be used in the future for treatment of autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation. 

- ""This research gives us a new way to think about treating autoimmune diseases," says Samaniego-Castruita.Resveratrol ameliorates high-fat-diet-induced abnormalities in liver glucose metabolism in mice via the AMPK pathwayHebei Medical Institute (China), July 19, 2021A new study on high fat diet is now available. 

- We found that resveratrol treatment significantly ameliorated the HFD-induced abnormalities in glucose metabolism in mice, increased glucose absorption and glycogen synthesis, downregulated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and activated Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase b (CaMKKb), and increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). 

- For many of these chemicals, the health effects are unknown. 

- "For instance, in 2002, when the Women's Health Initiative study found combination hormone replacement therapy to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, women stopped taking the drugs and incidence rates went down. 

- The program uses automated chemical screening technologies to expose living cells to chemicals and then examine the different biological changes they cause.Reporting in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, Rudel and Cardona identified 296 chemicals that were found to increase estradiol (a form of estrogen) or progesterone in cells in the laboratory. 

- "This study shows that a number of chemicals currently in use have the ability to manipulate hormones known to adversely affect breast cancer risk," says Dr. Sue Fenton, associate editor for the study and an expert in mammary gland development at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. 

- Knowledge generated by this effort will help government agencies regulate chemicals more effectively and assist companies in developing safer products.Antioxidant activity of limonene counteracts neurotoxicity triggered by amyloid beta 1-42 oligomers in cortical neuronsUniversity of Naples (Italy), July 19, 2021According to news reporting from Naples, Italy, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, “Many natural-derived compounds, including the essential oils from plants, are investigated to find new potential protective agents in several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD).”The news editors obtained a quote from the research from School of Medicine: “In the present study, we tested the neuroprotective effect of limonene, one of the main components of the genus * * Citrus* * , against the neurotoxicity elicited by Ab [ [1-42] ] oligomers, currently considered a triggering factor in AD. 

- Furthermore, researchers claim that these changes are beneficial to our mental and physical health.Body’s Response to Stress Causes DamageTo elaborate, consider the effect that stress has on the body. 

- This results in a reduced risk of inflammation-related diseases and mental conditions.Lead investigator Ivana Buric from Coventry University’s Centre for Psychology, Behaviour and Achievement stated:Millions of people around the world already enjoy the health benefits of mind-body interventions like yoga or meditation, but what they perhaps don’t realise is that these benefits begin at a molecular level and can change the way our genetic code goes about its business.These activities are leaving what we call a molecular signature in our cells, which reverses the effect that stress or anxiety would have on the body by changing how our genes are expressed. 

- Put simply, MBIs cause the brain to steer our DNA processes along a path which improves our wellbeing.More needs to be done to understand these effects in greater depth, for example how they compare with other healthy interventions like exercise or nutrition. 

- But this is an important foundation to build on to help future researchers explore the benefits of increasingly popular mind-body activities.Large-scale study finds greater sedentary hours increases risk of obstructive sleep apneaStudy finds that maintaining an active lifestyle can reduce the risk of OSA, encourages physicians to recommend exercise-based interventions for those at riskBrigham and Women's Hospital, July 22, 2021A new study by investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital examined the relationship between active lifestyles and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 

- "Our results suggest that promoting an active lifestyle may have substantial benefits for both prevention and treatment of OSA. 

- Severe OSA increases the risk of various heart issues, including abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure.Using the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII) and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS), the research team used statistical modeling to compare physical activity and sedentary hours with diagnoses of OSA. 

- While all study participants were health professionals, mild OSA is often difficult to detect and can remain clinically unrecognized. 

- New study shows transcendental meditation reduces emotional stress and improves academicsCenter for Wellness and Achievement in Education and Stanford University, July 22, 2021Students who participated in a meditation-based Quiet Time program utilizing the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique for four months had significant improvements in overall emotional stress symptoms, quality of sleep, and English Language Arts (ELA) academic achievement according to a new randomized controlled trial published last month in Education. 

- The study was conducted by researchers from the Center for Wellness and Achievement in Education and Stanford University. 

- "Students have been experiencing increased levels of stress and it's impacting their academic performance," said Laurent Valosek, lead author of the study and Executive Director of the Center for Wellness and Achievement in Education. 

- "This research shows the impact of meditation on the mental and physical health of high school students, and shows that meditation plays a vital role in promoting improved academic outcomes, even when compared to more time spent reading. 

- The study found that during a four-month period, the students practicing the TM technique experienced significant improvements in measures of health and academics as compared to students who engaged in sustained silent reading.These findings are consistent with past research on TM showing benefits related to emotional health and intelligence. 

- This is particularly noteworthy because the control group was doing sustained silent reading, suggesting that introducing meditation to the school day may be more effective in improving academic outcomes than additional time spent reading.Impact of vitamin D deficiency and autoimmunity on chronic hivesUniversity of Health Sciences (Turkey), July 19, 2021According to news reporting from Erzurum, Turkey, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, “Background and In this study, we investigated the role of vitamin D deficiency and autoimmunity in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) etiopathogenesis and their impact on the disease severity. 

- Sixty patients with CSU aged between 18 and 65 years were enrolled to the study.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Health Sciences: “The control group comprised 40 healthy individuals who had no episodes of urticaria or any other chronic diseases. 

- Traditional Japanese food may hold building blocks of COVID-19 treatmentsTokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, July 21, 2021Natto, a fermented soybean dish often served for breakfast in Japan, originated at the turn of the last millennium but may hold an answer to a modern problem: COVID-19, according to a new study based on cell cultures.Long thought to contribute to longer, healthier lives across Japan -- the country with the longest life expectancy on Earth and home to more than a quarter of the world's population aged 65 years or older -- natto was previously found to be a diet staple in those who were least likely to die from stroke or cardiac disease. 

- "Traditionally, Japanese people have assumed that natto is beneficial for their health," said paper author Tetsuya Mizutani, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Prevention Research at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (CEPiR-TUAT). 

- In this study, we investigated natto's antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), which causes respiratory disease in cattle. 

- "Osteoporosis is a chronic, painful, and debilitating disease which makes your bones less dense and more susceptible to fracture. 

- More common in women, it occurs when bones lose calcium and other minerals faster than the body can replace them.In Australia, an estimated 924,000 people have osteoporosis.The double-blind clinical study saw participants chew caffeine or a placebo gum for five minutes at two-hour intervals over a six-hour treatment period (total caffeine 800 mg). 

- But understanding how excess consumption could increase the risks of a highly preventable disease such as osteoporosis, is important. 

- "From here, researchers will explore and predict the impact of different levels of caffeine intake on short- and long-term bone health, with the aim to inform dietary guidelines in Australia.From heart to diabetes, these are the health benefits of strawberriesUniversity of Nevada, July 16, 2021Dietary berries, such as strawberries, are rich in bioactive compounds and have been shown to lower cardiometabolic risk. 

- Conclusions: These data suggest that consuming strawberries at two-and-a-half servings for four weeks significantly improves insulin resistance, lipid particle profiles, and serum PAI-1 in obese adults with elevated serum LDL-C.Omega 3 has beneficial effects on reducing relapse rate, inflammatory markers in MS patientsImam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (Saudi Arabia), July 14, 2021According to news originating from Dammam, Saudi Arabia, research stated, “Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, resulting in the degradation of the myelin sheath. 

- They repeated diet distribution experiments on these mice but did not observe similar muscle change, which confirmed the involvement of the circadian rhythm in muscle growth in the context of protein intake.Excited about the findings of their study published in a recent issue of the Cell Reports, Prof. Shibata emphasizes, "Protein-rich diet at an early phase of the daily active period, that is at breakfast, is important to maintain skeletal muscle health and enhance muscle volume and grip strength. 

- "Ginseng compound exerts neuroprotective effectsGachon University (South Korea), July 16, 2021According to news reporting from Gyeonggi Do, South Korea, research stated, “Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of b-amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the brain.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Gachon University: “Cell signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt are known to play an essential role in regulating cell survival, motility, transcription, metabolism, and progression of the cell cycle. 

- We observed that ginsenoside Rh1 was able to attenuate b-amyloid induced oxidative stress and cell death by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “Based on these findings, we suggest that ginsenoside Rh1 might be an efficacious therapeutic agent for AD.”Many kinds of happiness promote better health, study findsWeill Cornell University of Medicine, July 21, 2021A new study links the capacity to feel a variety of upbeat emotions to better health.The research suggests people who experience a range of positive emotions in their daily lives – from enthusiasm to cheerfulness and calm – have lower levels of inflammation, compared to those who experience a narrower range of emotions. 

- "There are many kinds of happiness, and experiencing a diversity of emotional states might reduce a person's vulnerability to psychopathology by preventing any one emotion from dominating their emotional life," said lead author Anthony Ong, professor of human development in the College of Human Ecology and professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.Little is known about the biological processes through which emotional experiences influence health outcomes. 

- This study sought to fill a bit of that gap.Specifically, the study sheds light on one potential biological pathway – systemic inflammation – through which diversity in everyday positive emotional experiences might "get under the skin" to influence long-term health.Ong and his colleagues analyzed the connection between "emodiversity" – the breadth and abundance of different emotions people experience – and markers of inflammation in the body. 

- "Our findings suggest that depletion or overabundance of positive emotions, in particular, has consequences for the functioning and health of one's emotional ecosystem. 

- "Growing evidence from other research has linked emotional processes with systemic inflammation, which has been shown to contribute to poor health, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, rheumatoid disease and osteoporosis, and leads to a number of processes that play a major role in premature death.How can these findings help one achieve better health?Label your good feelings as you experience them, Ong said. 

- "A person's nutrition impacts immunity," said senior author Marilyn Cornelis, associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. 

- "Besides following guidelines currently in place to slow the spread of the virus, we provide support for other relatively simple ways in which individuals can reduce their risk and that is through diet and nutrition," Cornelis said.The paper on nutrition and COVID-19 protection was published recently in the journal Nutrients.One or more cups of coffee per day was associated with about a 10% decrease in risk of COVID-19 compared to less than one cup per day. 

- Having been breastfed as a baby reduced the risk 10% compared to not having been breastfed.While the study shows diet appears to modestly reduce disease risk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends vaccines as the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 disease, especially severe illness and death. 

- Individuals with suppressed immune systems such as the elderly and those with existing comorbidities including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes and obesity, are more likely to experience severe outcomes of COVID-19.But other than weight management, less attention has focused on other modifiable risk factors preceding COVID-19 infection, said Cornelis, who studies how diet and nutrition contribute to chronic disease.Dr. 

- However, much of her nutrition research uses genetics, and with all UK Biobank participants currently genotyped, she hopes to use this information to gain better insight into how diet and nutrition offer protection from the disease.Biologic age reversed with lifestyle improvement plus supplementsInstitute for Functional Medicine (Seattle), July 14 2021.The April 15, 2021 issue of Aging published the results of an eight-week randomized trial which resulted in a reduction in biologic age among men who participated in lifestyle changes and consumed nutritional supplements. 

- The group was advised to participate in a minimum of 30 minutes of exercise daily and to perform breathing exercises twice per day for stress reduction.According to the Horvath DNAmAge clock, which evaluates DNA methylation patterns as a marker of biologic age, men who participated in the lifestyle program had scores that averaged 1.96 younger at the end of the program in comparison with the beginning, while control participants scored 1.27 years older. 

- "Research suggests L-carnitine could aid burn recoveryAnhui Medical University (China), July 12, 2021According to news reporting from First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University research stated, “Impaired hepatic fatty acid metabolism and persistent mitochondrial dysfunction are phenomena commonly associated with liver failure. 

- Decreased serum levels of L-carnitine, a amino acid derivative involved in fatty-acid and energy metabolism, have been reported in severe burn patients.”Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University: “The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of L-carnitine supplementation on mitochondrial damage and other hepatocyte injuries following severe burns and the related mechanisms. 

- The expression levels of the differentially expressed genes Fabp4, Acacb, Acsm5, and Pnpla3 in the liver tissue from burned rats and etomoxir-treated hepatocytes were also restored by treatment with exogenous carnitine.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Exogenous carnitine exerts protective effects against severe burn-induced cellular, fatty-acid metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction of hepatocytes by restoring CPT1 activity.”Red blood cell ‘traffic’ contributes to changes in brain oxygenationPenn State University, July 19, 2021Adequate blood flow supplies the brain with oxygen and nutrients, but the oxygenation tends to fluctuate in a distinct, consistent manner. 

- According to the researchers, this randomness could have potential implications for understanding the biological build-up mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. 

- The researchers discovered that these random red blood cell stoppages contributed to the fluctuations in oxygenation, further supporting a relationship between the flow of red blood cells through capillaries and the tiny changes in oxygenation that formed larger trends.Better understanding the regulation of blood flow and subsequent transport of oxygen can help researchers improve medical technology and explore causes of diseases such as Alzheimer’s, according to Drew.

- Thirdly, it was the crowning of stupidity to claim that someone could have Covid-19 without any symptoms at all or even to pass the disease along without showing any symptoms whatsoever.But let’s look at this one by one.1. 

- The fairy tale of no immunityFrom the World Health Organisation (WHO) to every Facebook-virologist, everyone claimed this virus was particularly dangerous, because there was no immunity against it, because it was a novel virus. 

- Tony and I often sat next to each other at immunology seminars at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda in the US, because we worked in related fields back then. 

- At the end of February, driving home from the recording of [a Swiss political TV debate show], I mentioned to Daniel Koch [former head of the Swiss federal section “Communicable Diseases” of the Federal Office of Public Health] that I suspected there was a general immunity in the population against Sars-Cov-2. 

- For every other disease that doesn’t afflict a certain group of people, we would come to the conclusion that that group is immune. 

- If this principle from now on gets naturalised into the realm of medicine, health insurers would really have a problem, but also teachers whose students could now claim to have whatever disease to skip school, if at the end of the day one didn’t need symptoms anymore to be sick.The next joke that some virologists shared was the claim that those who were sick without symptoms could still spread the virus to other people. 

- That doesn’t need to lead to symptoms, but it’s also not a disease. 

- This immunity also seems to be the problem for patients with a severe course of the disease. 

- But also people with a bad diet or who are malnourished may have a weakened immune system, which is why this virus does not only reveal the medical problems of a country, but also social issues.If an infected person does not have enough antibodies, i.e. 

- "Microbiota-targeted diets can change immune status, providing a promising avenue for decreasing inflammation in healthy adults," said Christopher Gardner, PhD, the Rehnborg Farquhar Professor and director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center. 

- The lead authors are Hannah Wastyk, a PhD student in bioengineering, and former postdoctoral scholar Gabriela Fragiadakis, PhD, who is now an assistant professor of medicine at UC-San Francisco.A wide body of evidence has demonstrated that diet shapes the gut microbiome, which can affect the immune system and overall health. 

- "We wanted to conduct a proof-of-concept study that could test whether microbiota-targeted food could be an avenue for combatting the overwhelming rise in chronic inflammatory diseases," Gardner said.The researchers focused on fiber and fermented foods due to previous reports of their potential health benefits. 

- While high-fiber diets have been associated with lower rates of mortality, the consumption of fermented foods can help with weight maintenance and may decrease the risk of diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease.The researchers analyzed blood and stool samples collected during a three-week pre-trial period, the 10 weeks of the diet, and a four-week period after the diet when the participants ate as they chose.The findings paint a nuanced picture of the influence of diet on gut microbes and immune status. 

- Another goal is to examine whether the consumption of fermented food decreases inflammation or improves other health markers in patients with immunological and metabolic diseases, and in pregnant women and older individuals. 

- "There are many more ways to target the microbiome with food and supplements, and we hope to continue to investigate how different diets, probiotics and prebiotics impact the microbiome and health in different groups," Justin Sonnenburg said.Effect of resveratrol intervention on renal pathological injury in type 2 diabetesCapital Medical University (China), July 11, 2021According to news reporting from Beijing, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a clinically common cardiovascular disease that can lead to kidney damage and adversely affect male fertility and sperm quality. 

- Resveratrol (Res) is a natural product that has a wide range of effects in animals and cell models.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Capital Medical University, “This research is designed to observe the effect of resveratrol (Res) intervention on renal pathologic injury and spermatogenesis in mice with type 2 diabetes (T2D). 

- Subsequently, RG was given Res intervention while MG received no treatment. 

- In addition, Res improved the spermatogenic function of T2D mice by increasing the sperm density and survival rate and restoring the percentage of spermatogenic cells at all levels.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “Res intervention in T2D mice can reduce kidney tissue damage, lower blood glucose (BG), and improve spermatogenic function by increasing sperm density and restoring the percentage of spermatogenic cells at all levels.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Eating whole grains linked to smaller increases in waist size, blood pressure, blood sugarStudy in middle- to older-aged adults suggests whole grains may protect against heart diseaseTufts University, July 13, 2021Middle- to older-aged adults who ate at least three servings of whole grains daily had smaller increases in waist size, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels over time compared to those who ate less than one-half serving per day, according to new research.Published July 13, 2021, in the Journal of Nutrition, the study by researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University examined how whole- and refined-grain intake over time impacted five risk factors of heart disease: Waist size, blood pressure, blood sugar, triglyceride, and HDL ("good") cholesterol.Using data from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort, which began in the 1970s to assess long-term risk factors of heart disease, the new research examined health outcomes associated with whole- and refined-grain consumption over a median of 18 years. 

- "Our findings suggest that eating whole-grain foods as part of a healthy diet delivers health benefits beyond just helping us lose or maintain weight as we age. 

- Managing these risk factors as we age may help to protect against heart disease," said Nicola McKeown, senior and corresponding author and a scientist on the Nutritional Epidemiology Team at the USDA HNRCA. 

- Sawicki did this work as part of her doctoral dissertation while a student at the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University and while working with the Nutritional Epidemiology Team at the USDA HNRCA.The greatest contributor to whole-grain intake among participants was whole-wheat breads and ready-to-eat whole-grain breakfast cereals. 

- The difference in health benefits between whole and refined grains may stem from the fact that whole grains are less processed than refined grains. 

- Whole grains have a fiber-rich outer layer and an inner germ layer packed with B vitamins, antioxidants, and small amounts of healthy fats. 

- This is the conclusion reached by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and the Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE). 

- The subjects are asked to also solve cognitively challenging tasks and wear numerous sensors that measure the amount of light they are exposed to during the day, among other environmental indicators," says Simone Kühn, head of the Lise Meitner Group for Environmental Neuroscience at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and lead author of the study.The results therefore, support the previously assumed positive effects of walking on health and extend them by the concrete positive effects on the brain. 

- "These findings provide neuroscientific support for the treatment of mental disorders. 

- Doctors could prescribe a walk in the fresh air as part of the therapy - similar to what is customary for health cures," says Anna Mascherek, post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) and co-author of the study.In the ongoing studies, the researchers also want to directly compare the effects of green environments vs urban spaces on the brain. 

- In order to understand where exactly the study participants spend their time outdoors, the researchers plan to use GPS (Global Positioning System) data and include other factors that may play a role such as traffic noise and air pollution.Vitamin C found to block growth of cancer stem cells, says peer reviewed studyUniversity of Salford (UK),  July 8, 2021Increasingly, researchers are discovering the role played by cancer stem cells in the growth and spread of the disease. 

- Researchers believe that cancer stem cells give cancer its ability to resist chemotherapy and radiation – the reason for treatment failure in advanced cancer patients.The study, helmed by researchers Michael P. Lisanti and Gloria Bonucelli, was published last month in Oncotarget, a peer-reviewed journal. 

- IV vitamin C therapy is available in some alternative and holistic cancer treatment clinics worldwide.The real reason why vitamin C is ignored by conventional medicine and the mainstream mediaAgain, vitamin C was 1,000 percent more effective than 2-DG, an experimental pharmaceutical drug – in targeting cancer stem cells. 

- If vitamin C were developed by big pharma, these results would be shouted from the rooftops and featured in newspaper headlines.Yet, as always, “the powers that be” in mainstream medicine respond with…crickets.The reason; say natural health experts, is all too obvious. 

- In addition, it has inhibited tumors in animal studies, and been shown to kill cancer cells in a wide variety of cancer cell lines.How much longer will the potential of this safe and powerful cancer-fighting nutrient be overlooked?Mothers' high-fat diet affects clotting response in sons, mice study findsUniversity of Reading (UK), July 13, 2021Mothers who follow a high fat diet may be affecting the cardiovascular health of their sons, according to a new study in mice.In a paper published in Scientific Reports, a team of scientists found that the male children of mice mothers who were fed on a high fat diet during pregnancy had unhealthy platelets, which are responsible for clotting, when fed on a high fat diet themselves.Although both male and female children of the mothers fed on a high fat diet showed a variety of risks associated with cardiovascular disease, it was only the platelets of male mice which were considered hyperactive. 

- Dyan Sellayah, lecturer in cellular and organismal metabolism at the University of Reading said:"Heart disease is one of the UK's biggest killers and mounting evidence suggests that the risk of developing it may be increased during early development, particularly during the gestation period where mothers have a high-fat diet/are obese. 

- The underlying mechanisms by which an unhealthy maternal diet may impact heart disease risk remains largely unknown. 

- "Children of the mothers fed on a high fat diet who followed a control diet however did not show the same concerning heart disease risks.The offspring from the group given a control diet had very similar levels of fat mass, cholesterol and other markets of cardiovascular health as the children of mothers fed a standard diet.In addition, where mothers had been fed a standard diet and their offspring fed a high fat diet, those children had higher levels of fat mass and other cardiovascular markers, but their platelets were statistically similar to the other groups apart from where both mum and child were fed high fat diet.Dr.

- Fortunately, USDA-funded research may have found a tasty way to slow disease onset.A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that diets high in flavonoids may protect cognitive health. 

- "Alzheimer's disease is a significant public health challenge," said Paul Jacques, nutritional epidemiologist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston. 

- "Given the absence of drug treatments, preventing Alzheimer's disease through a healthy diet is an important consideration. 

- "Our study showed that individuals with the highest intakes of flavonoids were more than 50% less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease, relative to those with the lowest intakes," he said. 

- "According to Jacques, flavonoid-rich diets help more than just Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. 

- "The bottom line is that there are many reasons to consume a healthy diet, including lower risks of cardiovascular disease and some cancers. 

- We can now add protection of cognitive health and prevention of Alzheimer's disease to that list. 

- "Mitochondria malfunction shown to be the major cause of Parkinson'sUniversity of Copenhagen (Denmark), July 9, 202112,000 people in Denmark and 7 to 10 million people worldwide suffer from Parkinson's Disease (PD). 

- It is the second most common neurogenerative disorder of aging and the most common movement disorder, but the cause of the disease is largely unknown.In a new study, researchers from the University of Copenhagen show that the most common form of the disease, encompassing 90 to 95 percent of all Parkinson's Disease cases known as sporadic PD, is caused by a blockage of a pathway that regulates the nerve cell's powerhouse, the mitochondria. 

- It causes neurons to gradually die, which is the reason for the development of Parkinson's Disease symptoms, and why it leads to dementia.The blockage is caused by a dysregulation of the immune genes, more specifically a pathway called type 1 interferon, which is normally important for fight against viruses, but now we show that it is also responsible for regulating the energy supply of the nerve cells. 

- But that does not seem to be the case in patients with Parkinson's Disease. 

- For example, they are very important for fighting COVID-19, and a mutation in the related gene has been shown to be linked to a deadly outcome after contracting COVID-19.The researchers combined and analyzed four data sets, which studied neurons from brains with Parkinson's Disease and looked at what type of genes they express.They then looked at which gene patterns were disturbed in patients with Parkinson's Disease and especially those who had also developed PD with dementia.In order to test the results, the major findings of the combined data was tried in three different mouse models using a negative regulator of the type I interferon pathway, PIAS2, which had been identified from the patients study as one of the key proteins linked to the progression of Parkinson's Disease and dementia. 

- So when we compare patients to same-aged healthy patients without Parkinson's Disease, we see that this PIAS2-protein is highly expressed in the neurons, which is why this pathway should be evaluated for potential roles in the other forms of familial Parkinson's Disease that we have not studied here. 

- "The researchers hope the study will encourage research to counteract the pathway blockage, which could have a beneficial impact on the disease and towards preventing dementia.In the next stages, the Issazadeh-Navikas group will study how the pathwaycontributes to neuronal homeostasis and survival, as well as how its dysregulation causes neuronal cell death.Combining plant-based diet and a healthy microbiome may protect against multiple sclerosisMetabolism of isoflavone by gut bacteria protects mice from MS-like inflammationUniversity of Iowa, July 13, 2021A new University of Iowa study suggests that metabolism of plant-based dietary substances by specific gut bacteria, which are lacking in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), may provide protection against the disease.The study led by Ashutosh Mangalam, PhD, UI associate professor of pathology, shows that a diet rich in isoflavone, a phytoestrogen or plant-based compound that resembles estrogen, protects against multiple sclerosis-like symptoms in a mouse model of the disease. 

- "Our new study provides evidence that the combination of dietary isoflavones and these isoflavone metabolizing gut bacteria may serve as a potential treatment for MS."Isoflavones are found in soybeans, peanuts, chickpeas and other legumes. 

- Conversely, a diet lacking isoflavones promotes a microbiome in mice which is similar to one observed in patients with MS and lacks beneficial bacteria that can metabolize isoflavone.Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the brain and spinal cord where the immune system attacks the protective coating surrounding nerve fibers. 

- The symptoms of this disease include muscles weakness, balance issues, and problems with vision and thinking. 

- While there are treatments that slow down the disease, there is currently no cure for MS.Although the exact cause of MS is unknown, a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors are thought to initiate the disease. 

- Although role of gut microbiome in human diseases such as MS is being appreciated, the mechanism through which these gut bacteria might influence the disease is poorly understood.In the current study, Mangalam's team, including first author Samantha Jensen, a UI graduate student in immunology, found that the bacteria that are lacking in patients with MS are able to suppress inflammation in a mouse model of MS. 

- The team compared the effects of an isoflavone diet and an isoflavone-free diet on disease in the mouse model of MS. 

- They found that the isoflavone diet led to disease protection. 

- Furthermore, the team was able to show that a specific isoflavone metabolite called equol, which is produced by the gut bacteria from isoflavone, is also able to provide protection against disease. 

- "This study suggests that an isoflavone diet may be protective so long as the isoflavone metabolizing gut bacteria are present in the intestines," say Mangalam, who also is a member of the Iowa Neuroscience institute and Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center.How a Mediterranean diet could reduce osteoporosisUniversity of East Anglia (UK), July 12, 2021Eating a Mediterranean-type diet could reduce bone loss in people with osteoporosis - according to new research from the University of East Anglia.New findings published today show that sticking to a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, nuts, unrefined cereals, olive oil, and fish can reduce hip bone loss within just 12 months.The study is the first long-term, pan-European clinical trial looking at the impact of a Mediterranean diet on bone health in older adults.More than 1,000 people aged between 65 and 79 took part in the trial, and volunteers were randomised into two groups - one which followed a Mediterranean diet and a control group which did not.Bone density was measured at the start and after 12 months. 

- This is the area which connects the shaft of the thigh bone to its rounded head, which fits in the hip joint.UK study lead Prof Susan Fairweather-Tait, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: "This is a particularly sensitive area for osteoporosis as loss of bone in the femoral neck is often the cause of hip fracture, which is common in elderly people with osteoporosis. 

- "A Mediterranean diet is already proven to have other health benefits, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and cancer," said Prof Fairweather-Tait. 

- "'A Mediterranean-like dietary pattern with vitamin D3 (10 μg/day) supplements reduced rate of bone loss in older Europeans with osteoporosis at baseline: results of a one year randomised controlled trial' is published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .Rishi mushroom promotes sleep through a gut microbiota-dependent and serotonin-involved pathwayHang-zhou Medical College (China), July 10, 2021According to news reporting out of Zhejiang, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Ganoderma lucidum is a medicinal mushroom used in traditional Chinese medicine with putative tranquilizing effects. 

- However, the component of G. lucidum that promotes sleep has not been clearly identified.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Hangzhou Medical College, “Here, the effect and mechanism of the acidic part of the alcohol extract of G. lucidum mycelia (GLAA) on sleep were studied in mice. 

- Both the GLAA sleep promotion effect and the altered faecal metabolites correlated with sleep behaviours disappeared after gut microbiota depletion with antibiotics.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Our results showed that GLAA promotes sleep through a gut microbiota-dependent and serotonin-associated pathway in mice.”Vitamin C found to block growth of cancer stem cells, says peer reviewed studyUniversity of Salford (UK),  July 8, 2021Increasingly, researchers are discovering the role played by cancer stem cells in the growth and spread of the disease.

- One year of aerobic exercise training may reduce risk of Alzheimer's in older adultsUniversity of Texas Southwestern, July 6, 2021New research suggests one year of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise training improved cardiorespiratory fitness, cerebral blood flow regulation, memory and executive function in people with mild cognitive impairment. 

- The data suggest improvement in cerebrovascular function from exercise training also has the potential to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease in older adults, according to the research team at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 

- The research paper is published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60–80% of dementia cases, according to the Alzheimer's Association. 

- The group estimates more than 6 million people living in the U.S. with Alzheimer's.More facts from the Alzheimer's Association:Alzheimer's kills more people than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined.Alzheimer's deaths have increased by 16% during the COVID-19 pandemic.In 2021, Alzheimer's is projected to cost the nation $355 billion.Credit: American Physiological SocietyIn this new study, the research team observed 37 people with mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor stage of Alzheimer's disease. 

- At the beginning of the study, the subjects participated in three exercise sessions per week that consisted of brisk walking for 25–30 minutes. 

- After week 26, exercise sessions increased to four to five times per week for 30–40 minutes.Using these findings as a building block, a new two-year study is underway to determine the long-term impact of aerobic exercise on Alzheimer's disease, according to Tsubasa Tomoto, Ph.D., a member of the research team. 

- The researchers' goal is to turn the findings of both studies into more practical ways to mitigate the risk of the disease.Review finds intake of probiotics improves numerous factors in people with colorectal cancerUniversity of Malaya (Malaysia), June 30, 2021A systematic review of randomized trials that appeared on May 24, 2021 in Nutrition Reviews concluded that probiotic intake is associated with a number of beneficial effects in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with any stage of the disease.Probiotics are living microorganisms (typically bacteria, but also yeasts such as Saccharomyces spp.) 

- that when consumed in adequate amounts have been shown to benefit the health of the body. 

- Consuming probiotics may benefit gut health, nutritional status, immune function and even brain health. 

- Probiotic intake was also found to decrease chemotherapy side effects, decrease tumor growth, improve surgery outcomes, shorten hospital stay and lower risk of mortality.“The use of probiotics and synbiotics provides numerous health benefits, as seen in this systematic review,” the authors wrote. 

- “The findings in this systematic review also highlight the importance of preoperative administration of probiotics or synbiotics as well as postoperative administration of probiotics, especially for patients with colorectal cancer who have invasive surgeries and are on a chemotherapy regimen.”In closing, they note “In the future, the use of probiotics against colorectal cancer should be able to broaden and become more personalized in treatment of patients with colorectal cancer. 

- "In addition to lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, time-restricted eating could have a healthy impact on people with Type 2 diabetes. 

- This "nondipping" blood pressure is prevalent in patients with Type 2 diabetes and is associated with increased events of cardiovascular disease.The study found that imposing time-restricted feeding prevented diabetic mice from developing nondipping blood pressure. 

- "There are already many studies that show the health benefits of time-restricted eating, particularly for metabolic issues," Gong said. 

- "Vitamin D deficiency associated with higher blood pressure and impaired serum lipid profilesUrmia University of Medical Sciences (Iran), July 1, 2021According to news reporting out of Urmia University of Medical Sciences by NewsRx editors, research stated, “Hypertension is one of the leading causes of mortality in the world. 

- The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with markers of metabolic syndrome and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Urmia University of Medical Sciences: “This was a cross-sectional study on 171 adults (79 men) with primary hypertension and mean age of 50.70 ± 10.88 years, who did not take vitamin D supplement for the past 6 months. 

- Thus, CR may be an effective candidate for the development of a functional food for BPH treatment. 

- Although further investigation and validation is required, our study provides evidence, for developing a potential treatment for BPH from natural products.Psychedelic spurs growth of neural connections lost in depressionYale University, July 5, 2021The psychedelic drug psilocybin, a naturally occurring compound found in some mushrooms, has been studied as a potential treatment for depression for years. 

- "Longevity has ramifications for government and economic policies, as well as individuals' own health care and lifestyle decisions, rendering what's probable, or even possible, relevant at all levels of society.The new study, published June 30 in Demographic Research, uses statistical modeling to examine the extremes of human life. 

- With ongoing research into aging, the prospects of future medical and scientific discoveries and the relatively small number of people to have verifiably reached age 110 or older, experts have debated the possible limits to what is referred to as the maximum reported age at death. 

- While some scientists argue that disease and basic cell deterioration lead to a natural limit on human lifespan, others maintain there is no cap, as evidenced by record-breaking supercentenarians.Pearce and Adrian Raftery, a professor of sociology and of statistics at the UW, took a different approach. 

- Even with population growth and advances in health care, there is a flattening of the mortality rate after a certain age. 

- "They've gotten past all the various things life throws at you, such as disease. 

- The objective of this study was to determine if dried plum consumption reduces the risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in postmenopausal women, specifically examining lipid profiles, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, and inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. 

- After 6 months of intervention, total cholesterol (TC) in the 100 g/day treatment group (P = .002) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the 50 g/day treatment group (P = .005) improved significantly compared to baseline. 

- These findings suggest that daily consumption of 50–100 g dried plum improves CVD risk factors in postmenopausal women as exhibited by lower TC, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers with no clear dose dependence.Regular physical activity linked to more 'fit' preteen brainsChildrens Hospital Boston, July 2, 2021We know exercise has many health benefits.

- "Could Sumac Be Effective on COVID-19 Treatment?Fırat University Medicine Faculty (Turkey), June 11, 2021Sumac is an herbal product, commonly consumed as a spice and was used for medical treatment for centuries. 

- Recently, several scientific studies described the pathophysiology, clinical course, and the treatment of COVID-19 infection. 

- The examination of the characteristics of COVID-19 infection revealed via the clinical studies suggests that Sumac extract could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19. 

- On the contrary, the medications currently being used for treatment were directly administered in clinics, without scrutinizing whether they were effective against the novel coronavirus. 

- Subsequently, several medications were identified to be useful during the clinical course of the disease. 

- However, its effectiveness on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) should be clarified first through animal testing and subsequently should be tested through human subjects.ConclusionAn evaluation of the up to date knowledge, revealed by the clinical studies, on the characteristics of COVID-19 infection, its pathophysiology, clinic, and treatment, suggests that the use of Sumac extracts could be beneficial. 

- Based on the beneficial effects indicated by the scientific studies on Sumac extracts, the present review could be encouraging to investigate its effectiveness for COVID-19 treatment. 

- The authors of the present study believe that the benefits of Sumac extract can be tested by adding the adverse-effect-free Sumac extract to treatment and protecting the existing treatment protocols.Sugar intake during pregnancy is associated with allergy and allergic asthma in childrenUniversity of Bristol (UK), July 5, 2021High maternal sugar intake during pregnancy may increase the risk of allergy and allergic asthma in the offspring, according to an early study led by Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) involving almost 9,000 mother-child pairs.While some research has reported an association between a high consumption of sugar-containing beverages and asthma in children, the relation between maternal sugar intake during pregnancy and allergy and asthma in the offspring has been little studied.The team, which included researchers from University of Bristol, used data from a world-leading birth cohort study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), also known as 'Children of the 90s'. 

- A control group of animals received no treatment. 

- At the end of the treatment period, saw palmetto supplemented rats had significantly less fat tissue weight gain and total weight gain compared to the controls, without a gain in other tissue weight. 

- The Stroke Belt states included in this study were North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana.This study is the latest research to investigate the association between cardiovascular disease and diet - which foods have a positive vs. negative impact on cardiovascular disease risk. 

- Sudden cardiac death is a common cause of death and accounted for 1 in every 7.5 deaths in the United States in 2016, or nearly 367,000 deaths, according to 2019 American Heart Association statistics.Researchers included participants with and without a history of coronary heart disease at the beginning of the study and assessed diets through a food frequency questionnaire completed at the beginning of the study. 

- Participants were asked how often and in what quantities they had consumed 110 different food items in the previous year.Researchers calculated a Mediterranean diet score based on specific food groups considered beneficial or detrimental to health. 

- "After an average of nearly 10 years of follow-up every six months to check for cardiovascular disease events, more than 400 sudden cardiac deaths had occurred among the 21,000 study participants.The study found:Overall, participants who ate a Southern-style diet most regularly had a 46% higher risk of sudden cardiac death than people who had the least adherence to this dietary pattern. 

- Sugary drinks are the number one source of added sugar in the U.S. diet, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Heart Association supports sugary drink taxes to drive down consumption of these products. 

- "These findings support the notion that a healthier diet would prevent fatal cardiovascular disease and should encourage all of us to adopt a healthier diet as part of our lifestyles," said Stephen Juraschek, M.D., Ph.D., a member of the American Heart Association's Nutrition Committee of the Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health Council. 

- "This study also raises important points about health equity, food security and social determinants of health," he continued. 

- In a 2018 analysis, Shikany and colleagues reported that adults ages 45 and older with heart disease who had an affinity for the Southern diet had a higher risk of death from any cause, while greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause. 

- And in a 2015 study, the Southern diet was linked to a greater risk of coronary heart disease in the same population.The large population sample and regional diversity, including a significant number of Black participants, are considered strengths of the REGARDS research project. 

- Self-reported diet can include inaccuracies leading to bias that could reduce the strength of the associations observed.One usual association that remains unexplained is that among individuals with a history of heart disease, those who most adhered to the sweets dietary pattern had a 51% lower risk of sudden cardiac death than participants who followed that pattern the least. 

- Researchers note that they found "no viable explanation for the inverse association of the sweets dietary pattern with risk of sudden cardiac death in those with a history of coronary heart disease. 

- "5-minute workout lowers blood pressure as much as exercise, drugs'Strength training for breathing muscles' holds promise for host of health benefitsUniversity of Colorado, July 2, 2021Working out just five minutes daily via a practice described as "strength training for your breathing muscles" lowers blood pressure and improves some measures of vascular health as well as, or even more than, aerobic exercise or medication, new CU Boulder research shows.The study, published June 29 in the Journal of the American Heart Association, provides the strongest evidence yet that the ultra-time-efficient maneuver known as High-Resistance Inspiratory Muscle Strength Training (IMST) could play a key role in helping aging adults fend off cardiovascular disease - the nation's leading killer.In the United States alone, 65% of adults over age 50 have above-normal blood pressure - putting them at greater risk of heart attack or stroke. 

- Yet fewer than 40% meet recommended aerobic exercise guidelines. 

- "There are a lot of lifestyle strategies that we know can help people maintain cardiovascular health as they age. 

- "Developed in the 1980s as a way to help critically ill respiratory disease patients strengthen their diaphragm and other inspiratory (breathing) muscles, IMST involves inhaling vigorously through a hand-held device which provides resistance. 

- "We found that not only is it more time-efficient than traditional exercise programs, the benefits may be longer lasting," Craighead said.The treatment group also saw a 45% improvement in vascular endothelial function, or the ability for arteries to expand upon stimulation, and a significant increase in levels of nitric oxide, a molecule key for dilating arteries and preventing plaque buildup. 

- "We have identified a novel form of therapy that lowers blood pressure without giving people pharmacological compounds and with much higher adherence than aerobic exercise," said senior author Doug Seals, a Distinguished Professor of Integrative Physiology. 

- "The practice may be particularly helpful for postmenopausal women.In previous research, Seals' lab showed that postmenopausal women who are not taking supplemental estrogen don't reap as much benefit from aerobic exercise programs as men do when it comes to vascular endothelial function. 

- "If aerobic exercise won't improve this key measure of cardiovascular health for postmenopausal women, they need another lifestyle intervention that will," said Craighead. 

- "Seals said they're uncertain exactly how a maneuver to strengthen breathing muscles ends up lowering blood pressure, but they suspect it prompts the cells lining blood vessels to produce more nitric oxide, enabling them to relax.The National Institutes of Health recently awarded Seals $4 million to launch a larger follow-up study of about 100 people, comparing a 12-week IMST protocol head-to-head with an aerobic exercise program.Meanwhile, the research group is developing a smartphone app to enable people to do the protocol at home using already commercially available devices.Those considering IMST should consult with their doctor first. 

- "The results suggest that efforts to quickly resolve initially positive findings including same-day follow-up tests may help reduce anxiety and even prevent initiation of anxiety or depression medication," said Segel, assistant professor of health policy and administration at Penn State.This study demonstrates that some women who experience a false-positive mammogram may need additional follow-up care to effectively handle the increased anxiety that may accompany the experience, Segel said.More importantly, from a practitioner standpoint, the study identifies sub-populations who may be most at risk of increased anxiety following a false-positive mammogram, Segel said. 

- "Researchers studied commercial- and Medicaid-claims databases to identify women ages 40 to 64 who underwent screening mammography with no prior claims for anxiety or depression medications.The findings recently appeared in Medical Care.Thymoquinone in Black Seed oil increases the expression of neuroprotective proteins while decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokinesFlorida A&M University, June 29, 2021According to news originating from Tallahassee, Florida, research stated, "Neuroinflammation and microglial activation are pathological markers of a number of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. 

- "Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Florida A&M University, "Additionally, chronic microglial activation has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 

- We performed quantitative proteomic analysis using Orbitrap/Q-Exactive Proteomic LC-MS/MS (Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) to globally assess changes in protein expression between the treatment groups. 

- Our results indicated that TQ treatment of LPS/IFN gamma-activated microglial cells significantly increased the expression of 4 antioxidant, neuroprotective proteins: glutaredoxin-3 (21 fold; p< 0.001), biliverdin reductase A (15 fold; p< 0.0001), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (11 fold; p< 0.01), and mitochondria] Ion protease (> 8 fold; p< 0.001) compared to the untreated, activated cells. 

- Furthermore, TQ treatment significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, IL-2 = 38%, IL-4 = 19%, IL-6 = 83%, IL-10 = 237%, and IL-17a = 29%, in the activated microglia compared to the untreated, activated which expression levels were significantly elevated compared to the control microglia: IL-2 = 127%, IL-4 = 151%, IL-6 = 670%, IL-10 = 133%, IL-17a = 127%. 

- Upon assessing the gene expression of NFKB signaling targets, this study also demonstrated that TQ treatment of activated microglia resulted in > 7 fold down-regulation of several NFKB signaling targets genes, including interleukin 6 (IL6), complement factor B (CFB), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CXCL3), chemokine (C-C) motif ligand 5 (CCL5) compared to the untreated, activated microglia. 

- Our results show that TQ treatment of LPS/IFN gamma-activated BV-2 microglial cells induce a significant increase in expression of neuroprotective proteins, a significant decrease in expression inflammatory cytokines, and a decrease in the expression of signaling target genes of the NF kappa B pathway. 

- Our findings are the first to show that TQ treatment increased the expression of these neuroprotective proteins (biliverdin reductase-A, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, glutaredoxin-3, and mitochondrial Ion protease) in the activated BV-2 microglial cells. 

- Additionally, our results indicate that TQ treatment decreased the activation of the NF kappa B signaling pathway, which plays a key role in neuroinflammation. 

- "According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Our results demonstrate that TQ treatment reduces the inflammatory response and modulates the expression of specific proteins and genes and hence potentially reduce neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration driven by microglial activation."

- "We are searching through large databases containing genetic information of plants and animals, decoding new types of peptide molecules and studying their structure, with a view to testing them pharmacologically on enzymes or membrane receptors and ultimately utilizing them in the disease model," explains Gruber. 

- Finally, potential drug candidates are chemically synthesised in a slightly modified form based on the natural blueprint, to obtain optimised pharmacological properties.Study associates organic food intake in childhood with better cognitive developmentAnalysis of multiple prenatal and childhood environmental risk factors suggests that poor nutrition, house crowding and indoor air pollution are associated with poorer cognitive functionBarcelona Institute for Global Health (Spain), July 1, 2021A study analysing the association between a wide variety of prenatal and childhood exposures and neuropsychological development in school-age children has found that organic food intake is associated with better scores on tests of fluid intelligence (ability to solve novel reasoning problems) and working memory (ability of the brain to retain new information while it is needed in the short term). 

- The study, published in Environmental Pollution, was conceived and designed by researchers at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal)--a centre supported by the "la Caixa" Foundation--and the Pere Virgili Health Research Institute (IISPV-CERCA).The explanation for this association may be that "healthy diets, including organic diets, are richer than fast food diets in nutrients necessary for the brain, such as fatty acids, vitamins and antioxidants, which together may enhance cognitive function in childhood," commented lead author Jordi Júlvez, a researcher at IISPV-CERCA who works closely with ISGlobal.The study also found that fast food intake, house crowding and environmental tobacco smoke during childhood were associated with lower fluid intelligence scores. 

- "Improving antioxidant status in CF is an important clinical goal and may have a positive effect on health," Dr. Sagel said. 

- The two groups tolerated their vitamins equally well, and there were no differences in adverse events between the two groups.The study did not meet its primary endpoint: change in sputum MPO concentration over 16 weeks. 

- It was published in the Nature group journal Communications Chemistry.The researchers considered two compounds: (1) epigallocatechin gallate, known as EGCG, found naturally in green tea, which has attracted attention within the medical community for its potential health benefits; and (2) tannic acid, found in red wine, which is known to prevent the formation of toxic amyloid structures that cause neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. 

- The disease phenylketonuria (PKU), which produces the aggregation of the metabolite phenylalanine, is one common inborn metabolic disease. 

- "In our new study, we examined whether the molecules identified in past studies on Alzheimer's disease and other amyloid diseases, which are known to inhibit the formation of amyloid aggregates, could also help counteract the amyloid formation process of metabolites in metabolic diseases. 

- THC, which stands for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the ingredient in marijuana that causes people to feel high.The cannabis industry has exploded, aided by the legalization of medical and recreational marijuana in states around the United States and the removal of hemp-derived CBD from Schedule 1 status--reserved for drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse--at the federal level.Previous research shows that some people substitute medical cannabis (often with high concentrations of THC) for opioids and other pain medications, reporting that cannabis provides better pain relief and fewer side effects. 

- "Boehnke and his team surveyed people with fibromyalgia about their use of CBD for treatment of chronic pain. 

- "I was not expecting that level of substitution," said Boehnke, noting that the rate is quite similar to the substitution rate reported in the medical cannabis literature. 

- Some new information about William Thompson whistleblower confrontation with the CDC -- and a new study comparing adverse health conditions between vaccinated and unvaccinated childrenDr. 

- Over the years Brian has filed many FOIAs with federal health agencies and was in receipt of 1000s of pages of documents from a CDC informant, Dr. William Thompson questioning the efficacy and safety of vaccination. 

- According to the European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy, the recommended dosage of dandelion leaf is 4–10 grams steeped in hot water, up to three times per day.The study authors warn that reliance on vaccines is risky and dangerous, not just for individual health but also for herd immunity. 

- They compared weight gain and many other measures to no chocolate intake.Researchers report that among the women studied:Morning or nighttime chocolate intake did not lead to weight gain;Eating chocolate in the morning or in the evening can influence hunger and appetite, microbiota composition, sleep and more;A high intake of chocolate during the morning hours could help to burn fat and reduce blood glucose levels.Evening/night chocolate altered next-morning resting and exercise metabolism. 

- Our results show that chocolate reduced ad libitum energy intake, consistent with the observed reduction in hunger, appetite and the desire for sweets shown in previous studies," said Garaulet.Researchers find health benefits of connecticut-grown sugar kelpUniversity of Connecticut, June 24, 2021When most Americans think of seaweed, they probably conjure images of a slimy plant they encounter at the beach. 

- A pair of UConn researchers recently discovered Connecticut-grown sugar kelp may help prevent weight gain and the onset of conditions associated with obesity.In a paper published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry by College of Agriculture, Health, and Natural Resources faculty Young-Ki Park, assistant research professor in the Department of Nutritional Sciences, and Ji-Young Lee, professor and head of the Department of Nutritional Sciences, the researchers reported significant findings supporting the nutritional benefits of Connecticut-grown sugar kelp. 

- They found brown sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) inhibits hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in a mouse model of diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a fatty liver disease.They studied the differences between three groups of mouse models. 

- The diversity and composition of the microbiome are key to maintaining a host of health functions. 

- "But it's still pretty amazing data as this is the first scientific evidence for health benefits of the Connecticut-grown sugar kelp. 

- They hoped that, by gathering concrete data on the health benefits of sugar kelp, it could encourage people to consume seaweed. 

- "It's really an ever-growing industry in the world," Lee says.After completing this pre-clinical study, the researchers now hope to move into clinical studies to investigate the benefits sugar kelp may have for other health concerns. 

- Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services. 

- However, the greater GLP-1 response did not translate to an increased feeling of fullness as there were no differences observed in appetite perception between the three different protein shakes.Consumer trends in protein intake are on the rise with milk protein derivatives such as whey extensively used in consumer products such as protein shakes, fortified food and beverage products.There are alternative protein products available for vegetarians and vegans such as soy, rice, wheat and pea proteins but there is a relative lack of evidence on their health benefits in comparison to milk proteins. 

- "However, research in this area is still lacking and it would be interesting to clarify whether proteins from plant sources can provide identical metabolic health benefits as those with traditional sources such as milk. 

- Now, presidential campaigns and federal laws, public health policies, the mainstream media and the films and music are the conduits for how we define ourselves and establish the options of dogmatic beliefs that we ultimately identify with.

- AN EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTOf Gross Irregularities and Medical Incompetence in the Early Clinical Trials of AZTBy Lynn Gannett2000Please keep in mind that these two write-ups represent only the "tip of the iceberg," and for everything that is recorded here, there are literally dozens of other examples that I could give.My information is NOT included in John Lauritsen's book on AZT, simply because neither of us had heard of each other at that time (although I wish we had!). 

- Parks Mankahlana, couldn't have summed it up better when he said "...the profit takers who are benefiting from the scourge of HIV/AIDS will disappear to the affluent beaches of the world to enjoy wealth accumulated from humankind ravaged by a dreaded disease. 

- And recent drug trials have also been characterized by an absurdly brief follow-up period (24 or 36 weeks, for example), and effectiveness is often said to be determined by "surrogate markers" which have never been proven to relate to actual clinical health and/or increased survival. 

- I would NEVER trust my health or my life to the results of this so-called "research" or in the hands of these so-called "medical professionals." 

- The level of medical incompetence, unprofessionalism, unethical, dishonest, corrupt, illegal and immoral behavior was shocking and inexcusable. 

- * The Study Coordinator (and other medical staff responsible for study patients) often displayed a significant lack of understanding and unfamiliarity with the study protocols and important memos concerning their implementation - as though she had not even read them, or had totally misunderstood and misinterpreted them, even in instances pertaining to terminology and procedures FUNDAMENTAL to the protocol itself, often months after the study had been underway.e.g. 

- Additionally, early Grade I and Grade II toxicities should have indicated the need for interim lab monitoring of Hemoglobin, especially with this patient's complicated medical history, but instead this patient had NO lab work performed between week 20 (13DEC89) and week 24 (10JAN90), even though she was in for a pentamidine treatment on 20DEC89 and could have easily had a blood sample drawn. 

- At some point during this time interval, her original medical chart was "lost," never to be found again, requiring a new chart to be made up, which subsequently obviously lacked significant information concerning her medical history. 

- I was shocked, outraged and horrified when this whole situation occurred, and documented this gross medical incompetence and blatant violation of protocol requirements as carefully as I could because I wanted everything to be ON RECORD so that no one could later deny it or cover it up. 

- I often observed, as did the RTI (Research Triangle Institute) site monitors, this unreported information recorded or mentioned in the patient's regular medical chart.E.g. 

- When I questioned these and other similar mistakes, I would be chastised by the Principal Investigator and/or Study Coordinator for being too "nit picky" or for inappropriately questioning someone's medical "expertise" since I did not have (nor did my position require) a medical degree. 

- * Medical lab results were ROUTINELY transcribed incorrectly onto the research forms by the Study Coordinator (who I suspect may have dyslexia - at the very least, she does not have the "detail-oriented" type of mind necessary for this type of research position).

- At t0, 8 people in the treatment group and 7 people in the placebo group were positive for a bacterial URTI. 

- At t3, none of the subjects in either the treatment or placebo group were found to have a positive bacterial throat culture.Primary Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcome measure was the resolution of URTI symptoms. 

- Researchers assessed these symptoms at baseline (t0), 3 days (t1), after 5 days (t2), and at the final timepoint (t3) of the study, 15 days.At t1, 17% of the participants in the treatment group still had 1 symptom of an URTI. 

- In contrast, about 72% of people in the placebo group still displayed 1 symptom (RR: 2.93, CI: 1.95–4.42).The results of a univariate analysis showed that only treatment with oral propolis spray was related to the disappearance of symptoms (resolution of all symptoms in the treatment group vs the placebo group: X2=35.57, df=1, P
Clinical Significance of Micronutrient Supplementation in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients with Severe ARDSUniversity Hospital Wuerzburg (Germany), June 12, 2021AbstractThe interplay between inflammation and oxidative stress is a vicious circle, potentially resulting in organ damage. 

- Essential micronutrients such as selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) support anti-oxidative defense systems and are commonly depleted in severe disease. 

- According to intensive care unit (ICU) standard operating procedures, patients received 1.0 mg of intravenous Se daily on top of artificial nutrition, which contained various amounts of Se and Zn. 

- Micronutrients, inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte subsets and clinical data were extracted from the patient data management system on admission and after 10 to 14 days of treatment. 

- Sufficient Se and Zn levels may potentially be of clinical significance for an adequate immune response in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS.Pilot Study of the Tart Cherry Juice for the Treatment of Insomnia and Investigation of MechanismsLouisiana State University, June 20, 2021Insomnia is common in the elderly and is associated with chronic disease, but use of hypnotics increases the incidence of falls. 

- "Further studies are needed to elucidate whether vitamin supplementation is effective in migraine patients in general, and whether patients with mild deficiency are more likely to benefit from supplementation," says Suzanne Hagler, MD, a Headache Medicine fellow in the division of Neurology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and lead author of the study.Dr. 

- Because few received vitamins alone, the researchers were unable to determine vitamin effectiveness in preventing migraines.She found that girls and young woman were more likely than boys and young men to have coenzyme Q10 deficiencies at baseline. 

- Patients with chronic migraines were more likely to have coenzyme Q10 and riboflavin deficiencies than those with episodic migraines.Previous studies have indicated that certain vitamins and vitamin deficiencies may be important in the migraine process. 

- Studies using vitamins to prevent migraines, however, have had conflicting success.Research suggests mask-wearing can increase struggles with social anxietyUniversity of Waterloo (Canada), June 21, 2021People who struggle with social anxiety might experience increased distress related to mask-wearing during and even after the COVID-19 pandemic.A paper authored by researchers from the University of Waterloo's Department of Psychology and Centre for Mental Health Research and Treatment also has implications for those who haven't necessarily suffered from social anxiety in the past. 

- "The adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes, including anxiety and depression, have been well-documented," said David Moscovitch, professor of clinical psychology and co-author of the paper. 

- "However, little is known about effects of increased mask-wearing on social interactions, social anxiety, or overall mental health. 

- "We found that mask-wearing by people with social anxiety is likely to be influenced by their perception of social norms and expectations, which may or may not be consistent with public-health guidelines and can vary widely by region and context," said Sidney Saint, an undergraduate psychology student at Waterloo and lead author of the paper.The paper also highlights that people with social anxiety have difficulty detecting ambiguous social cues and are likely to interpret them negatively. 

- "Due to their self-concealing function, masks may be difficult for some people to discard even when mask-wearing is no longer required by public health mandates," Saint said.In addition to contributing insights to guide clinicians toward effective assessment and treatment, the paper shows that people with social anxiety may be particularly vulnerable to periods of norm transitions where expectations for mask-wearing are in flux or become a matter of personal choice.Going with your gut can result in better decision-making than using detailed data methods, study showsCity University London, June 21, 2021Managers who use their gut instinct together with simple decision-making strategies may make equally good, but faster, decisions as those who use data to reach an outcome, a new study has found.The report, co-authored by academics at the Business School (formerly Cass), King's Business School, and the University of Malta, finds that the reliance on data analysis in decision-making might be counterproductive as this reduces decision-making speed without ensuring more accuracy.The research, based on information from 122 advertising, digital, publishing, and software companies, finds that using data to inform decision making under high uncertainty is often not optimal.

- “There was also evidence in the literature that vitamin D plays a role in obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and COPD, and we now found that the association exists with this scarring form of lung disease too. 

- ""Our study suggests that adequate levels of vitamin D may be important for lung health,” she concluded. 

- “We might now consider adding vitamin D deficiency to the list of factors involved in disease processes, along with the known ILD risk factors such as environmental toxins and smoking.”

- "Considering that coenzyme Q10 has attracted noticeable attention in recent years for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension in regard to its effect on inflammatory factors such as cytokines, it is therefore hypothesized that supplementation with coenzyme Q10 reduces the proinflammatory factors," write Nasim Bagheri Nesami of Iran's Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences and colleagues. 

- Plasma adiponectin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP, a marker of inflammation) and the cytokines interleukin 2, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured before and after treatment.At the end of the study, participants who received CoQ10 had significant declines in interleukin-6 and hs-CRP compared with levels measured upon enrollment. 

- They also experienced an increase in adiponectin, while levels in the placebo group slightly declined.The authors suggest that CoQ10 could be prescribed as a supplement along with antihypertensive medication for patients with mildly elevated blood pressure, and recommend that further research be conducted to validate the current findings.Exposure to nature during COVID-19 lockdown was beneficial for mental healthA study by the ICTA-UAB and the University of Porto analyses the effects of exposure to green spaces during the first months of the COVID19 pandemic in Spain and PortugalUniversitat Autònoma of Barcelona (Spain), June 18, 2021A study carried out by the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (ICTA-UAB) and the Instituto de Saúde Pública of the University of Porto (ISPUP), concludes that exposure to natural spaces during the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 was beneficial for the mental health of Spanish and Portuguese citizens.The research shows that, in Portugal, during the first confinement, people who maintained or increased contact with natural public spaces, such as parks and coastal areas, or who could contemplate these spaces from their homes, presented lower levels of stress, psychological distress and psychosomatic symptoms.In Spain, those who maintained or increased contact with private natural spaces, such as indoor plants or community green areas, presented lower levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms. 

- This could be due to the fact that Spain adopted more restrictive measures for foreign circulation during the period analysed.The research Exposure to nature and mental health outcomes during COVID-19 lockdown. 

- A comparison between Portugal and Spain, published in the journal Environment International, was conducted between March and May 2020.Dr Ana Isabel Ribeiro, researcher at the ISPUP and first author of the work together with Margarita Triguero-Mas from the ICTA-UAB says that "we decided to study whether natural, public and private spaces had a beneficial effect on the mental health of Portuguese and Spanish citizens, helping them to better cope with the negative effects of lockdown". 

- For her part, Margarita Triguero-Mas adds that "people around us and ourselves talked about how we missed the park we crossed when we went to the office or the walk on the beach with our dogs, so we wanted to check to what extent contact with natural spaces was an important factor during confinement".Several previous articles have also shown the positive impact of exposure to natural spaces on mental health, that is, in reducing stress, anxiety and improving psychological well-being as a whole. 

- "Taking into account what is described in the literature, we wanted to evaluate whether people who enjoyed greater exposure to natural spaces during the first COVID-19 lockdown had better mental health indicators than those who had no contact with natural areas", explains Dr Ribeiro. 

- The survey covered aspects related to the frequency and type of exposure people had to natural spaces (public and private), before and during the first confinement; mental health questions to assess levels of stress, mental disorders and somatization symptoms, and sociodemographic issues. 

- In turn, those who practiced physical exercise indicated greater exposure to these places. 

- Likewise, those who contemplated natural spaces from their homes obtained improvements in all the mental health outcomes analysed: stress, mental disorders and somatization. 

- "This study clearly demonstrates the benefit of natural spaces for the mental health of the population in a context of public health crisis," says Ana Isabel Ribeiro. 

- It is important to revalue how building remodelling or new homes can be healthier spaces that promote and prevent deterioration in the health of the people who inhabit them".Flame retardants and pesticides overtake heavy metals as biggest contributors to IQ lossNew York University, June 2, 2021Adverse outcomes from childhood exposures to lead and mercury are on the decline in the United States, likely due to decades of restrictions on the use of heavy metals, a new study finds.Despite decreasing levels, exposure to these and other toxic chemicals, especially flame retardants and pesticides, still resulted in more than a million cases of intellectual disability in the United States between 2001 and 2016. 

- "Our findings suggest that our efforts to reduce exposure to heavy metals are paying off, but that toxic exposures in general continue to represent a formidable risk to Americans' physical, mental, and economic health," says lead study investigator Abigail Gaylord, MPH, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone. 

- "Although people argue against costly regulations, unrestricted use of these chemicals is far more expensive in the long run, with American children bearing the largest burden," says senior study author Leonardo Trasande, MD, MPP, the Jim G. Hendrick, MD Professor at NYU Langone Health.Publishing online Jan. 14 in the journal Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology, the new study is the only long-term neurological and economic investigation of its kind, the authors say. 

- Data on women and children was obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.The researchers used results from several previous environmental health studies to estimate the annual number of IQ points lost per unit of exposure to each of the four main chemicals in the study. 

- Then, they estimated the lost productivity and medical costs over the course of the children's lives linked to long-term intellectual disability using a second algorithm, which valued each lost IQ point at $22,268 and each case of intellectual disability at $1,272,470.While exposure to these chemicals persists despite tightened regulations, experts say Americans can help limit some of the effects by avoiding the use of household products or foods that contain them. 

- mutation in colorectal cancer patientsStudy provides mechanistic link between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer developmentHarvard Medical School, June 17, 2021Bottom Line: Genetic mutations indicative of DNA damage were associated with high red meat consumption and increased cancer-related mortality in patients with colorectal cancer.Journal in Which the Study was Published: Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer ResearchAuthor: Marios Giannakis, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Dana-Farber Cancer InstituteBackground: "We have known for some time that consumption of processed meat and red meat is a risk factor for colorectal cancer," said Giannakis. 

- "Identifying these molecular changes in colon cells that can cause cancer would not only support the role of red meat in colorectal cancer development but would also provide novel avenues for cancer prevention and treatment. 

- "How the Study was Conducted: To identify genetic changes associated with red meat intake, Giannakis and colleagues sequenced DNA from matched normal and colorectal tumor tissues from 900 patients with colorectal cancer who had participated in one of three nationwide prospective cohort studies, namely the Nurses' Health Studies and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. 

- Our data further support red meat intake as a risk factor for colorectal cancer and also provide opportunities to prevent, detect, and treat this disease. 

- Current studies from Giannakis and his colleagues are exploring the potential role of red meat intake and alkylating damage in diverse groups of patients.Funding & Disclosures: The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Stand Up To Cancer Colorectal Cancer Dream Team Translational Research Grant (co-administered by the AACR), the Project P Fund, the Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge Award, the Nodal Award from the Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center, the Friends of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Bennett Family Fund, and the Entertainment Industry Foundation through the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance and Stand Up To Cancer.Giannakis has received research funding from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Servier, and Janssen unrelated to this study.Association of higher average daily polyphenol intake with Mediterranean diet adherence and decreased waist to hip circumferenceUniversity of the Aegean (Greece), June 14, 2021According to news reporting originating from the University of the Aegean research stated, “Research data indicate the possible effect of both polyphenols consumption and Mediterranean diet adherence on metabolic diseases’ prevalence.

- In a new study, published in Marine Drugs, researchers have shown how these algae confer health benefits.“In the past, people have wondered why the number of colon cancer patients in Japan is the lowest in the world,” said Yong-Su Jin (CABBI/BSD/MME), a professor of food microbiology. 

- We wanted to ask whether their seaweed diet was connected to the lower frequency of colon cancer.”Although several studies have shown that Asians who eat seaweed regularly have lower risk of colon, colorectal, and breast cancer, it was unclear which component was responsible for the anti-cancer effects.In the study, the researchers broke down the structure of different types of red seaweed using enzymes and tested the sugars that were produced to see which one of them caused health benefits.

- Hiking is not only a great way to get outside in nature, it also has plenty of physical and mental health benefits for those who take part.Hiking differs in many way from taking a regular stroll around your neighbourhood. 

- This means you can achieve the recommended 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity without even needing to go for a run or head to the gym.The benefits of getting enough exercise are clear. 

- Not only will it improve your physical health, sleep and stress management, exercise also reduces your chances of developing certain chronic diseases, such as dementia, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression and certain cancers. 

- In older adults, some research suggests hiking may be able to improve hypertension.Hiking is also beneficial even for those with pre-existing health conditions. 

- Research shows hiking leads to weight loss and improves cardiovascular health in pre-diabetic adults, likely reducing their risk of getting type 2 diabetes. 

- It’s also been shown to improve other aspects of health, including muscle strength, balance and flexibility in older adults with obesity. 

- Research shows this form of hiking increases cardiovascular health, weight loss, and muscle strength in people without any pre-existing health conditions, as well as those with chronic conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease.A further health benefit of hiking is that it’s classed as “green exercise”. 

- This refers to the added health benefit that doing physical activity in nature has on us. 

- Research shows that not only can green exercise decrease blood pressure, it also benefits mental wellbeing by improving mood and reducing depression to a greater extent than exercising indoors cThis is why some research suggests healthcare professionals should recommend hiking to patients as a low-cost way of improving health where possible. 

- In England, there’s even an initiative being piloted by the National Health Service to assess the health impacts of green prescribing – where patients are being prescribed outdoor activities – such as hiking or gardening – to improve their mental and physical health.Get outdoorsEven if you’ve never hiked before, it’s easy to get started. 

- And with many of us still likely to be vacationing locally this year, it can be a great way to get away from home and explore new sights.Trial finds improvement in metabolic syndrome components, fatty liver, insulin resistance in garlic-intake participantsBaqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences (Iran) June 10, 2921A randomized trial reported  in Phytotherapy Research found an association between intake of garlic and improvement in several components of metabolic syndrome—a cluster of factors that increase the risk of developing diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. 

- Blood pressure, fasting glucose, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT, an enzyme that is elevated in liver disease and also is associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk), appetite (including hunger, fullness, desire to eat and ability to eat), height, weight, waist circumference, food intake and physical activity were evaluated upon enrollment and at six and twelve weeks. 

- Considering garlic’s low cost and wide availability, as well as its prebiotic action and cardiovascular benefits, adding garlic to a healthy diet and exercise regimen could be an easy and effective measure to help protect against metabolic syndrome and its associated disease risks.Evaluation of the effect of curcumin on pneumonia: A systematic review of preclinical studiesIsfahan University of Medical Sciences (Iran), May 3, 2021Pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and causes a significant burden on the healthcare systems.

- He’s a professor of oncology in the department of cancer prevention and control at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, N.Y.The study also found that Black women had the lowest vitamin D levels, which might help explain their generally poorer outcomes after a breast cancer diagnosis, Yao’s group said.The findings were presented at the recent virtual annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.One oncologist unconnected to the research said the findings could offer women a simple new way to fight breast cancer.Vitamin D “can be found in some foods and is made when sunlight strikes human skin,” explained Dr. Alice Police, a breast cancer researcher at Northwell Health’s Katz Institute for Women’s Health, in Westchester, N.Y.“This may be an opportunity for an important intervention in breast cancer outcomes for all women, but particularly in the Black population,” she said.The study involved nearly 4,000 patients who had their vitamin D levels checked and were followed for a median of almost 10 years.The patients were divided into three levels: vitamin D deficient (less than 20 nanograms per milliliter in blood tests); insufficient (20 to 29 ng/ml); or sufficient (30 or more ng/ml).The study wasn’t designed to prove cause and effect. 

- The association appeared somewhat stronger among lower-weight patients and those diagnosed with more advanced breast cancers.“Our findings from this large, observational cohort of breast cancer survivors with long follow-up provide the strongest evidence to date for maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels in breast cancer patients, particularly among Black women and patients with more advanced-stage disease,” Yao said in a Roswell Park news release.Dr. 

- “This could be an important step in efforts to level the playing field for this disease: Let the sunshine in!”Because these findings were presented at a medical meeting, they should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journalResearchers Say This One Tiny Life Adjustment Can Reduce Depression RiskHarvard, MIT, and the University of Colorado, June 11, 2021Research continues to pour in showing an increase in mental health problems from the COVID-19 pandemic (and government policies resulting from it). 

- One medical study found that depression symptoms were three times higher than before the pandemic. 

- “We found that even one-hour earlier sleep timing is associated with significantly lower risk of depression.”The discovery is especially important as the increase in remote-working schedules has led many to sleep in later, which could have important implications on their mental health.It’s also important because it’s a cheap and readily accessible option for treatment.Americans face many barriers to mental healthcare. 

- Furthermore, a more severe mental health diagnosis can be even more costly. 

- Patients with severe depression who receive medical care spend nearly $11,000 a year on average, according to a report by CNBC.The expense, coupled with a shortage in providers and medical deserts throughout large parts of the US, lead many to forgo treatment altogether. 

- According to the National Council on Behavioral Health, 56 percent of patients want to access a mental health provider but face barriers.Those barriers were of course increased during COVID as facilities were shut down and non-COVID patients were denied care. 

- But this new research shows individuals have the ability to take charge of their own circumstances by making small, daily changes that can help them fight their disease.Alice Walker, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Color Purple,famously said, “People give up their power by thinking they don’t have any.” People often forget that they have power within themselves to confront their problems and in turn, seek protection from other external, earthly things—namely the government or their leaders. 

- And in spite of the cunning of artful political leaders, these three gifts from God precede all human legislation, and are superior to it.”When dealing with mental health issues—as full disclosure, I do—an important guiding principle is self-responsibility. 

- Ultimately, your mental health is your responsibility and no one can do that work for you.This same principle can be applied more broadly to those without mental health issues too. 

- But we can control how we face (and hopefully overcome) those circumstances.We can’t turn back the clocks on all that has happened over the past year and a half, but if we turn the alarm clock one hour back we just might be a step closer to regaining control of our health.

- — Aldous HuxleyFor half a century, the pharmaceutical industry has shown near zero tolerance towards criticism against its unequivocal failures and medical catastrophes. 

- Permanent disabilities and deaths due to unsafe drugs, such as Merck’s anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx, Pizer’s Bextra, synthetic hormone replacement therapy, thalidomide, and the earlier cellular pertussis and the 1976 influenza vaccines, are regarded as the collateral damage of getting unsafe medical products on the market. 

- During the past two decades a tightly-knit and collaborative relationship has evolved between the pharmaceutical industry, federal health agencies, Congress, Silicon Valley, and the new culture of billionaire philanthropists such as Bill Gates. 

- As a consequence, modern medicine’s dire risks to public health are undermined. 

- The broader picture and the darker players operating behind the tragic legacy of medical iatrogenic failures remain largely hidden from the public. 

- In recent years those physicians, researchers and health advocates who dissent from the pharmaceutical narrative often face a formidable blowback resulting in censorship and destroyed reputations.Over forty years ago, sociologist and philosopher Ivan Illich prophetically observed a conspicuous unfolding of modern medicine becoming divorced from itself and the ethical basis for treating illnesses. 

- He wrote, “the medical establishment has become a major threat to health.” Illich was among the first poignant critics of the corporatization of medicine to address the problems of “medicalization,” the process by which very human non-medical conditions are redefined as medical diseases and then diagnosed and pharmaceutically treated as such. 

- Increasingly researchers, more often than not funded by private drug companies and backed by an army of lobbyists, are discovering ways to reevaluate health conditions with only flimsy clinical evidence into the actual etiology of disease — even infectious pandemics. 

- Yet systemic corruption throughout our national healthcare has been a boon for drug makers who can then develop novel medications for illnesses that could otherwise be treated by less expensive and safer drugless therapies “Modern medicine is a negation of health,” Illich wrote in his acclaimed book Medical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health. 

- “It isn’t organized to serve human health, but only itself, as an institution. 

- It makes more people sick than it heals.” It is a system that today depends upon volumes of flawed medical clinical trials, financial incentives, institutional bureaucracy, revolving doors between government and private industry, rampant conflicts of interests, and an aggressive propaganda machine that has had enormous success in marginalizing and ridiculing critics both within and outside the medical complex. 

- Our medical edifice has violated every defining principle of scientific inquiry that should place uncompromising value on objective, unbiased inquiry and open conversation and debate over conflicting views. 

- Over the years, the steady rise in the number of class action and criminal lawsuits against pharmaceutical firms, Freedom of Information Act submissions, and false testimonies by federal health officials before Congressional subcommittees have confirmed Illich’s warnings.For Illich the dangerous consequence is that conventional medicine has become depersonalized. 

- Whereas in the past malpractice was treated as a serious ethical issue – and iatrogenic death, or fatalities due to medical error, is now the US’s third leading cause of mortality – it is simply perceived as a technical glitch that can be corrected by further technical solutions. 

- As a result of persistent self-denial over conventional medicine’s inherent failures, the dominant medical paradigm that now governs the nation’s health has succeeded in barricading itself behind a monolithic propaganda machine and a compliant media with the ability to marginalize criticism and to hermetically seal itself from being called to legal account. 

- However it is a science solely molded in the image of medical bureaucrats and their powerful allies who have been christened as experts.And all of these past medical failures, the estimated 90 percent of junk pharmaceutical clinical trials published in junk medical journals, institutionalized hubris, and the drug makers’ capture of our health agencies is being openly staged in the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global theater.When we are being lectured to recite the pandemic mantra in unison by Joe Biden, Governor Andrew Cuomo, the UK’s Boris Johnson, and one of the church of Scientism’s head priests Neil DeGrasse Tyson — “Follow the Science” – whose science is being referred to? 

- Is it the pseudo-science promulgated by the cult of Skepticism that pollutes hundreds of Wikipedia’s health entries? 

- Is it corporate, pharmaceutical-based science; medical research and discovery motivated by astronomical commercial incentives to appease the hedonic financial appetites of shareholders? 

- Replying to MSNBC’s Chuck Todd, Fauci made his self-proclamation, “what you’re seeing as attacks on me quite frankly are attacks on science.”Or is it science that is meticulously vetted by a range of independent professionals who aspire to arrive at the truth of a medical problem or to find a medical solution? 

- It is this latter group who are most inclined to impartially review the pros and cons of scientific papers, the clinical trials of a drug, vaccine, medical device and diagnostic tool; then, based upon the empirical evidence, a medical intervention’s value, efficacy and safety is properly determined. 

- Sadly this latter group is rarely if ever invited to sit at the regulatory table or to advise national health policy. 

- Rather, the pursuit of medical facts about disease and pandemics has ceased to be a evidence-based methodology of objective inquiry and has become a means to institute authority and control over a population. 

- The consequence is that those who question or challenge the dominant medical ideology are censored, cancelled and have their reputations destroyedWe must come to the conclusion that modern conventional medicine has lacked the enthusiasm to uncover scientific truths for many decades. 

- Unlike the “hard sciences,” such as mathematics and physics, medical practice is “soft.” Medical certainty, as in the serious hard sciences, should have as its objective “value-neutral truth.” Medicine and medical discovery is equally an art form. 

- Over two decades ago, the British Medical Journal published an article, “The Practice of Clinical Medicine as an Art and as a Science.” The authors spread out on the table the prime principle to govern medical research as a determining factor for publication.“… scientific thinking should, must, be insulated from all kinds of psychological, sociological, economic, political, moral and ideological factors which tend to influence thought in life and society. 

- Without those proscriptions, objective knowledge of truth will degenerate into prejudice and ideology.”Unfortunately, none of the self-anointed captains now steering our global and governmental health agencies to confront the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the deeply worrisome escalation of Covid-19 vaccine injuries and deaths, has ever bothered to give this fundamental scientific axiom a moment’s worth of reflection. 

- The “experts,” such as Anthony Fauci and the FDA’s new Commissioner Janet Woodcock – a 35-year careerist at one of our most discredited regulatory agencies, hold their high rank within the medical hierarchy because they were seduced to sacrifice “objective knowledge of truth” in return for prestige, power and wealth. 

- They serve as the prejudiced and ideological protectors of authentic science’s antithesis: the pharmaceutical industrial complexWe do not need to stretch too deep into Western medicine’s history — back to the era of leeches, blood-letting and exorcizing neurological disorders — to find examples of medical consensus and treatments displaying humanity’s sheer stupidity. 

- We have continued to inherit this madness up into the 21st century, and during the pandemic it blazes before our eyes.Unfortunately, too many Americans and citizens in other nations are blindly willing to surrender their faith and trust to medical experts, the latest drug or vaccine on the market, and the federal regulators who are mandated to assure that these medications and vaccines have been scrupulously reviewed to evaluate their safety and efficacy profiles. 

- We assume that medical interventions are evidence-based. 

- Even physicians, who were viewed as the exemplars of health and knowledge, smoked regularly. 

- Medical leaders assured us that this could not possibly be associated with smoking. 

- Consequently several generations of Americans suffered and died prematurely and needlessly because the science accepted by the nation’s health officials was unconditionally false.California State University bioethicist and author of The Illusion of Evidence Based Medicine, Prof. Leemon McHenry views the epidemic of bad medical research as similar to dirty money laundering. 

- Exercise was perceived as unnecessary after high school and college. 

- The different iterations of the American food pyramid, starting with the Food for Young Children guide in 1916 and leading up to the 1979 Daily Food Guide, suffered from a serious lack of knowledge and a misunderstanding about nutrition. 

- In the 20th century alone, leading medical journals and government agencies would promote electroshock therapy, bariatric surgery, mercury amalgams and dental fluoride, diethylstilbestrol, synthetic hormone replacement, artificial sweeteners such as saccharine and Monsanto’s aspartame and vaccine ethylmercury. 

- However, today researchers frequently publish research papers identifying the very serious health risks for these products, which earlier were supported by reams of fraudulent corporate-sponsored research to court regulators.But despite all of the reliable scientific data, it has failed to rein in national health policies and the conduct of the CDC, NIAID and FDA to lessen the health risks Americans are exposed to daily.It is now 15 months since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11th of last year. 

- Nor are our health officials telling us the truth about the adverse effects of prolonged mask-wearing, social isolation and quarantines, the vaccines’ safety profiles, the inflated numbers of Covid-19 cases and mortalities, and approving expensive novel drugs shown to be questionably effective.While many criticize Big Pharma’s abuse of public relations firms to whitewash their noxious public image, in 2015, The Hill reported that the federal government spent over $4 billion on public relations services and over half of that went to the world’s largest firms. 

- Last September, Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded the PR firm Fors Marsh Group $250 million to twist the handling of the pandemic in his favor. 

- Surely large PR firms have an enormous role within the cartel of governments’ health ministries, the World Health organization, the drug and vaccine industry, and billionaire donors who are now directing the pandemic.Fortunately the faux scientific artifice upon which the authoritarians in power have defined the pandemic is crumbling. 

- For the first time in medical history, tens of thousands of physicians and medical professionals are calling out our officials and the drug companies for vagrant acts of corruption and deception. 

- We are discovering that health officials intentionally exaggerated SARS-CoV-2’s severity and sabotaged viable medical alternatives to curtail the progression of infection in a way that is scientifically sound, compassionate, and not jeopardized by pharmaceutical interests. 

- ‘The deepest sin against the human mind,” Huxley warned, “is to believe things without evidence.” In the face of millions of unnecessary and preventable Covid-19 deaths due to the irresponsible authority handed to the Fauci-s, Gates-s, Tedros-s, and Matt Handcock-s of the world, a grave moral sin has been committed by allowing technocratic scientism to override medical evidence.

- Plant-based and/or fish diets may help lessen severity of COVID-19 infectionJohns Hopkins University, June 8, 2021Plant-based and/or fish (pescatarian) diets may help lower the odds of developing moderate to severe COVID-19 infection, suggest the findings of a six-country study, published in the online journal BMJ Nutrition Prevention & Health.They were associated with 73% and 59% lower odds, respectively, of severe disease, the findings indicate.Several studies have suggested that dietmight have an important role in symptom severity and illness duration of COVID-19 infection. 

- The researchers used this network to identify clinicians at high risk of COVID-19 infection as a result of their jobs.The online survey, which ran between July and September 2020, was designed to elicit detailed information about respondents' dietary patterns, based on a 47-item food frequency questionnaire, over the previous year, and the severity of any COVID-19 infections they had had, using objective criteria.The survey also gathered information on personal background, medical history, medication use, and lifestyle.The various diets were combined into plant-based (higher in vegetables, legumes, and nuts, and lower in poultry and red and processed meats); pescatarian/plant-based (as above, but with added fish/seafood); and low carb-high protein diets.Some 568 respondents (cases) said they had had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection or no symptoms but a positive swab test for the infection; 2316 said they hadn't had any symptoms/tested positive (comparison group).Among the 568 cases, 138 clinicians said they had had moderate to severe COVID-19 infection; the remaining 430 said they had had very mild to mild COVID-19 infection.After factoring in several potentially influential variables, including age, ethnicity, medical specialty, and lifestyle (smoking, physical activity), respondents who said they ate plant-based diets' or plant-based/pescatarian diets had, respectively, 73% and 59% lower odds of moderate to severe COVID-19 infection, compared with those who didn't have these dietary patterns.And compared with those who said they ate a plant-based diet, those who said they ate a low carb-high protein diet had nearly 4 times the odds of moderate to severe COVID-19 infection.These associations held true when weight (BMI) and co-existing medical conditions were also factored in.But no association was observed between any type of diet and the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection or length of the subsequent illness.This is an observational study, and so can't establish cause, only correlation. 

- It also relied on individual recall rather than on objective assessments, and the definition of certain dietary patterns may vary by country, point out the researchers.Men outnumbered women in the study, so the findings may not be applicable to women, they add.But plant-based diets are rich in nutrients, especially phytochemicals (polyphenols, carotenoids), vitamins and minerals, all of which are important for a healthy immune system, say the researchers.And fish is an important source of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, both of which have anti-inflammatory properties, they add. 

- "The trends in this study are limited by study size (small numbers with a confirmed positive test) and design (self-reporting on diet and symptoms) so caution is needed in the interpretation of the findings," comments Deputy Chair of the NNEdPro Nutrition and COVID-19 Taskforce, Shane McAuliffe. 

- Although magnesium intake has been related to mood and cardio-metabolic disease, its relation with hostility remains unclear.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Columbia University, “We hypothesize that high total magnesium intake is associated with lower levels of hostility because of its putative antidepressant mechanisms. 

- This prospective study provides evidence that in young adults, high magne-sium intake was inversely associated with hostility level independent of socio-demographic and major lifestyle factors.”Study compares heart benefits of low-fat and plant-centered dietsNew findings suggest that a plant-centered diet could help lower heart disease riskUniversity of Minnesota, June 7, 2021There has been a long-standing debate as to whether a low-fat or a plant-centered diet is better at lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. 

- A new study that followed more than 4,700 people over 30 years, found that a plant-centered diet was associated with a lower long-term risk for cardiovascular disease. 

- "Since 1980, dietary guidelines in the United States and in Europe have recommended eating low amounts of saturated fat because of the high rates of heart disease in these regions," said research team leader David Jacobs, PhD, from the University of Minnesota. 

- "This is not necessarily wrong, but our study shows that plant-centered diets can also lower bad cholesterol and may be even better at addressing heart disease risk. 

- The low-fat diet is based on the Keys Score, a good formulation of the "low saturated fat" message, driven by saturated fat, but also including polyunsaturated fat and dietary cholesterol.Yuni Choi, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Jacobs' lab will present the research as part of NUTRITION 2021 LIVE ONLINE, a virtual conference hosted by the American Society for Nutrition (ASN). 

- During more than 30 years of follow up, there were 280 cases of cardiovascular disease, 135 cases of coronary heart disease, and 92 cases of stroke among the study participants.To assess eating patterns, the researchers conducted three detailed diet history interviews over the follow-up period. 

- Based on this information, the researchers calculated scores for all participants based on both the Keys Score of the A Priori Diet Quality Score (APDQS), which captures the plant-centered diet.After accounting for various factors including socioeconomic status, educational level, energy intake, history of cardiovascular disease, smoking and body mass index, the researchers found that having a more plant-centered diet (higher APDQS Scores) and consuming less saturated fat (lower Keys Scores) were both associated with lower LDL levels. 

- Higher APDQS scores, but not lower Keys Scores, were strongly associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease and stroke. 

- "The researchers are carrying out a variety of studies looking at how the APDQS diet score relates to various health outcomes. 

- They are also interested in studying how different diets affect gut bacteria, which is known to influence many aspects of health and disease.High caffeine consumption may be associated with increased risk of blinding eye diseaseMount Sinai School of Medicine, June 7, 2021Consuming large amounts of daily caffeine may increase the risk of glaucoma more than three-fold for those with a genetic predisposition to higher eye pressure according to an international, multi-center study. 

- With glaucoma, patients typically experience few or no symptoms until the disease progresses and they have vision loss. 

- "We previously published work suggesting that high caffeine intake increased the risk of the high-tension open angle glaucoma among people with a family history of disease. 

- In this study we show that an adverse relation between high caffeine intake and glaucoma was evident only among those with the highest genetic risk score for elevated eye pressure," says lead/corresponding author Louis R. Pasquale, MD, FARVO, Deputy Chair for Ophthalmology Research for the Mount Sinai Health System.A team of researchers used the UK Biobank, a large-scale population-based biomedical database supported by various health and governmental agencies. 

- Participants were between 39 and 73 years old and provided their health records along with DNA samples, collected to generate data. 

- "While we can currently include this superfood in salads and on burgers as a preventative measure, the researchers expect onion extract will eventually be added to food products such as juice or baked goods and be sold in pill form as a type of natural cancer treatment.Exercise likely to be best treatment for depression in coronary heart diseaseRCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences (Ireland), June 8, 2021A study by RCSI indicates that exercise is probably the most effective short-term treatment for depression in people with coronary heart disease, when compared to antidepressants and psychotherapy or more complex care.The study, led by researchers at RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, is published in the June edition of Psychosomatic Medicine.This is the first systematic review to compare treatments for depression in those with coronary disease and the findings provides valuable clinical information to help doctors determine the best treatment plan for patients.The researchers reviewed treatment trials which investigated antidepressants, psychotherapy, exercise, combined psychotherapy and antidepressants, and collaborative care (i.e. 

- treatments devised by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians with input from the patient).To measure effectiveness, the researchers looked at factors including patient adherence to the treatment (dropout rate) and change in depressive symptoms eight weeks after commencing treatment.The strongest treatment effects were found to be exercise and combination treatments (antidepressants and psychotherapy). 

- However, as the combination study results have a high risk of bias, the findings of the review suggest that exercise is probably the most effective treatment. 

- "Depression is common in patients with coronary artery disease. 

- Having both conditions can have a significant impact on the quality of life for patients so it is vital that they access to the most effective treatments," commented Dr Frank Doyle, Senior Lecturer Division of Population Health Sciences, RCSI and the study's first author. 

- "Our study indicates that exercise is likely to be the best treatment for depression following coronary artery disease. 

- Our findings further highlight the clinical importance of exercise as a treatment as we see that it improves not only depression, but also other important aspects of heart disease, such as lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, in these patients. 

- ""We continue to see emerging evidence of the importance of lifestyle to treat disease - in comparison to other treatments - but further high-quality research is needed. 

- People with coronary heart disease who have symptoms of depression should talk to their doctor about treatments that are most suitable for their personal needs, and clinicians can be confident of recommending exercise to their patients. 

- "Dr Frank Doyle and the study's senior authors, Prof. Jan Sorensen (Health Outcomes Research Centre, RCSI) and Prof. Martin Dempster (School of Psychology, Queen's University Belfast), conducted the study in collaboration with researchers in the USA, The Netherlands, the UK and Denmark.This study was also the first of its kind to establish a new method to conduct systematic reviews known as a hybrid review, which is a combination of umbrella reviews and systematic reviews.Study examines link between obesity, food container chemical substitutesUniversity of Iowa, June 9, 2021A new study from the University of Iowa shows that a pair of common chemicals that manufacturers use to make plastic food containers, water bottles, and other consumer products do not contribute to obesity to the extent of the chemical it's replacing.The chemicals -- bisphenol F and bisphenol S (known as BPF and BPS) -- are being used increasingly by food packaging manufacturers as substitutes for bisphenol A (BPA), which studies have found disrupts endocrine systems and causes numerous health problems. 

- The chemical is absorbed into the body mainly through the food or water it contacts in the container.But concern was raised several years ago when numerous studies found BPA increases the risk of various health issues, in particular obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. 

- The new University of Iowa College of Public Health study is the first to determine the health impacts of BPF and BPS exposure on obesity in humans. 

- Using data from a nationwide population-based study conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the researchers confirm that BPA is associated with increased obesity in humans. 

- Growing evidence fruit may lower type 2 diabetes riskResearch has found eating at least two serves of fruit daily has been linked with 36% lower odds of developing type 2 diabetesEdith Cowan University (Australia), June 2, 2021Eating at least two serves of fruit daily has been linked with 36 percent lower odds of developing type 2 diabetes, a new Edith Cowan University (ECU) study has found.The study, published today in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, revealed that people who ate at least two serves of fruit per day had higher measures of insulin sensitivity than those who ate less than half a serve.Type 2 diabetes is a growing public health concern with an estimated 451 million people worldwide living with the condition. 

- A further 374 million people are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.The study's lead author, Dr Nicola Bondonno from ECU's Institute for Nutrition Research, said the findings offer fresh evidence for the health benefits of fruit. 

- "This is important because high levels of circulating insulin (hyperinsulinemia) can damage blood vessels and are related not only to diabetes, but also to high blood pressure, obesity, and heart disease. 

- "As well as being high in vitamins and minerals, fruits are a great source of phytochemicals which may increase insulin sensitivity, and fibre which helps regulate the release of sugar into the blood and also helps people feel fuller for longer," she said. 

- "The study builds on Dr Bondonno's research into the health benefits of fruit and vegetables, particularly those that contain a key nutrient known as flavonoids. 

- The research is part of ECU's Institute of Nutrition Research.Ginkgo biloba leaves have multicomponent and multitarget synergistic effects on treatment of neurodegenerative diseasesJiangsu Kanion Pharmaceutical Co (China), June 1, 2021According to news reporting out of Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Ginkgo biloba L. leaves (GBLs), as widely used plant extract sources, significantly improve cognitive, learning and memory function in patients with dementia. 

- However, few studies have been conducted on the specific mechanism of Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs).”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Jiangsu Kanion Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., “In this study, network pharmacology was employed to elucidate potential mechanism of GBLs in the treatment of NDs. 

- Potential targets of GBLs were integrated with disease targets, and intersection targets were exactly the potential action targets of GBLs for treating NDs; these key targets were enriched and analyzed by the protein protein interaction (PPI) analysis and molecular docking verification. 

- By using the software iGEMDOCK, the main target proteins were found to bind well to the main active components of GBLs.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “GBLs have the characteristics of multi-component and multi-target synergistic effect on the treatment of NDs, which preliminarily predicted its possible molecular mechanism of action, and provided the basis for the follow-up study.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Diets that promote inflammation could increase breast cancer riskAnalysis of dietary patterns for over 350,000 women suggests eating more anti-inflammatory foods helps lower riskCatalan Institute of Oncology and Biomedical Research Institute (Spain) June 7, 2021A new study of more than 350,000 women found that women with diets incorporating more foods that increase inflammation in the body had a 12% increase in their risk of breast cancer compared to women who consume more anti-inflammatory diets. 

- The new findings are being presented at NUTRITION 2021 LIVE ONLINE.The study authors found that moving from a more anti-inflammatory diet toward one that increases inflammation upped breast cancer risk in an almost linear manner. 

- "People consume food not nutrients, thus examining overall dietary patterns, rather than single components of diets can lead to more accurate conclusions when analysing associations with a health outcome such as breast cancer. 

- "The new results are based on data from the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, a prospective study that recruited more than 500,000 participants across 10 European countries starting in the mid-1990s. 

- "As a next step, the researchers plan to evaluate the association of the inflammatory potential of diet and other dietary patterns with breast cancer survival using participants in the EPIC study.Emerging impact of quercetin in the treatment of prostate cancerShahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (Iran), June 3, 2021According to news originating from Tehran, Iran, research stated, “Quercetin is a flavonoid agent detected in fruits and vegetables with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer effects. 

- This flavonoid can suppress cell cycle transition and induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells.”Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences: “Therapeutic effects of quercetin have been assessed in diverse cancers including prostate cancer through the establishment of in vitro and in vivo experiments. 

- For instance, a combination of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and quercetin has been recommended as a novel modality for the treatment of prostate cancer.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “These kinds of strategies might overcome resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells. 

- Complementary therapies are said to reduce the symptoms associated with stress and anxiety, and therefore may reduce the chances of severe illness, such as hypertension and heart disease. 

- Now, Eri Eguchi and co-workers at Okayama University, together with researchers across Japan, have conducted the first study into the effect of aromatherapy-based foot massage on blood pressure, anxiety and health-related quality of life in people living in the community.57 participants took part in the study; 52 women and 5 men. 

- Participants also completed questionnaires on anxiety status and health-related quality of life at each stage of the trial. 

- The participants were divided into two groups, and one group were taught to perform a 45-minute aromatherapy-based foot massage on themselves three times a week for four weeks.The results suggest that aroma foot massage decreased the participants' average blood pressure readings, and state of anxiety, and tended to increased mental health-related quality of life score. 

- However the effect of massages was not significant with changes in other factors such as physical health-related quality of life scores and heart rate.In their paper published in March 2016 in PLOS One, Eguchi's team are cautiously optimistic about the potential for self-administered massage to reduce anxiety in the population: "[although] it was difficult to differentiate the effects of the aromatherapy from the effects of the massage therapy... [the combination] may be an effective way to increase mental health and improve blood pressure. 

- Trials have indicated that certain essential oils, when inhaled, can reduce blood pressure levels and alleviate depression by stimulating the olfactory system.Massage (in its many forms) also has a long history in therapeutic medicine, and the practice of manipulating key pressure points in the body to induce relaxation has been shown to improve mental and physical health. 

- However, detailed scientific studies of the effects of aromatherapy foot massage – an increasingly popular treatment in Japan – on blood pressure and perceived quality of life are limited.Significance and further workWhile the trial carried out by Eguchi and her team is limited in some respects, their results provide an initial starting point from which to extend studies into the benefits of aroma foot massage for the general population. 

- Their findings that massage, or the aromatherapy, or a combination of both, reduce blood pressurereadings (at least in the short term) warrants further investigation.Eguchi and her team acknowledge that their decision to advertise for participants may have encouraged more health-conscious and pro-active people to apply. 

- Further work is needed to determine the effect of aroma foot massage on specific age and sex categories, for example, before such interventions are encouraged in the wider population.Proteomics reveals how exercise increases the efficiency of muscle energy productionUniversity of Copenhagen (Denmark), May 27, 2021Mitochondria are the cell's power plants and produce the majority of a cell's energy needs through an electrochemical process called electron transport chain coupled to another process known as oxidative phosphorylation. 

- The research, which is published in Cell Reports, also examined how this process is influenced by exercise training. 

- "This study has allowed for a comprehensive quantification of electron transport chain proteins within supercomplexes and how they respond to exercise training. 

- These data have implications for how exercise improves the efficiency of energy production in muscle," says Associate Professor Atul S. Deshmukh from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR) at the University of Copenhagen.Traditional methods provide too little detailIt is already well established that exercise training stimulates mitochondrial mass and affects the formation of supercomplexes, which allows mitochondria in skeletal muscle to produce energy more efficiently. 

- But questions remain about which complexes cluster into supercomplexes and how.To better understand supercomplex formation, particularly in response to exercise, the team of scientists studied two groups of mice. 

- One group was active, and given an exercise wheel for 25 days, and the second group was sedentary, and was not provided the exercise wheel. 

- This provided unprecedented detail of mitochondrial supercomplexes in skeletal muscle and how exercise training influences their formation. 

- Their approach demonstrated that not all of the proteins in each complex or a supercomplex respond to exercise in the same manner. 

- "Mitochondrial protein content is known to increase with exercise, thus understanding how these proteins assemble into supercomplexes is crucial to decipher how they work.

- None of the patients had metastatic disease. 

- Deficiency was detected in 456 patients (81.28%) and insufficiency was detected in 61 patients (10.87 %).”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “This study points out that vitamin D levels in breast cancer patients should be measured and be corrected whenever diagnosed.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Low levels of omega-3 associated with higher risk of psychosis, says studyRCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences (Ireland), June 1, 2021New research has found that adolescents with higher levels of an omega-3 fatty acid in their blood were less likely to develop psychotic disorder in early adulthood, suggesting that it may have a potential preventative effect of reducing the risk of psychosis.The study, led by researchers from RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, is published in Translational Psychiatry.Over 3,800 individuals in Bristol's Children of the 90s health study were assessed for psychotic disorder, depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder at age 17 and at age 24.During these assessments, blood samples were collected, and the researchers measured the levels of omega-6 fatty acids, which generally increase inflammation in the body, and omega-3 fatty acids, which generally reduce inflammation.While there was little evidence that fatty acids were associated with mental disorders at age 17, the researchers found that 24-year-olds with psychotic disorder, depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder had higher levels of omega-6 than omega-3 fatty acids compared to those without these disorders.The researchers also found that 24-year-olds with psychotic disorder had lower levels of DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid typically found in oily fish or dietary supplements, than 24-year-olds without psychotic disorder. 

- "The results could also raise questions about the relationship between the development of mental health disorders and omega-6 fatty acids, which are typically found in vegetable oils.

- Barley reduced both low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, and non-high-density lipoprotein, or non-HDL, by seven per cent.The review also indicated that barley had similar cholesterol-lowering effects as oats, which is often the go-to grain for health benefits.The research review, published in The European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, included 14 studies on clinical trials conducted in seven countries, including Canada.It is the first study to look at the effects of barley and barley products on both LDL and non-HDL cholesterol in addition to apolipoprotein B, or apoB, a lipoprotein that carries bad cholesterol through the blood. 

- "The findings are most important for populations at high risk for cardiovascular disease, such as Type 2 diabetics, who have normal levels of LDL cholesterol, but elevated levels of non-HDL or apo B," said Dr. Vladimir Vuksan, research scientist and associate director of the Risk Factor Modification Centre of St. Michael's. 

- "High cholesterol and diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke, historically treated with medications. 

- "Health Canada, the FDA and several health authorities worldwide have already approved health claims that barley lowers LDL cholesterol, but this is the first review showing the effects on other harmful lipids. 

- "Despite its benefits Dr. Vuksan said barley is not as well-established as some other health-recommended foods—such as oats. 

- "After looking at the evidence, we can also say that barley is comparably effective as oats in reducing overall risk of cardiovascular disease" said Dr. Vuksan.Barley is higher in fibre, has twice the protein and almost half the calories of oats, which are important considerations for those with weight or dietary concerns. Dr. 

- Vitamin B6 deficiency enhances the noradrenergic system, leading to behavioral deficitsTokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, May 27, 2021Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder characterized by positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, negative symptoms such as apathy and lack of emotion, and cognitive impairment. 

- These results show that the behavioral deficits in VB6(-) mice may be caused by an enhancement of NAergic signaling.Schizophrenic patients with VB6 deficiency, who account for more than 35% of all patients, present with relatively severe clinical symptoms and treatment resistance. 

- They will also provide evidence based on pathophysiology for a new therapeutic strategy called "VB6 treatment for schizophrenia," which we are currently conducting clinical research on.Families with a child with ADHD can benefit from mindfulness trainingRadboud University Medical Center (Netherlands), May 27, 2021Children with ADHD are generally treated with medication and/or behavioral treatments. 

- There was an increase in mindful parenting, self-compassion and an improvement in mental health among the parents. 

- Yet, a subgroup appeared to benefit: One in three children reliably improved on self-control following MYmind, whereas only one in ten improved when following only regular care.Professor of Environmental Sensitivity in Health and psychologist Corina Greven of Radboudumc, the Donders Institute and Karakter says that usual interventions for children with ADHD typically do not target mental health of parents, although they often struggle with parenting stress, anxiety or own ADHD symptoms. 

- The study was conducted in collaboration with the Radboud Center for Mindfulness.Sweet cherry anthocyanins support liver healthZhei-Jang University (China), June 1, 2021Anthocyanins from sweet cherries may protect against diet-induced liver steatosis, or excessive amounts of fat in the liver’s tissue, says a new study with rats.The study , published in the journal Nutrition, built upon the abundant existing literature on the beneficial role anthocyanins have as an antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hyperlipidemic component.Specifically, the cyanidin-3-glucoside variant “[has] been reported to ameliorate hepatic steatosis and adipose inflammation,” the researchers wrote. 

- The condition known as liver steatosis is a common non-alcoholic fatty liver disease usually treated with drugs, but according to the researchers, some drug used for treatment “are usually accompanied by some adverse effect.”For 15 weeks, the researchers investigated the effects of sweet cherry anthocyanin supplementation have on alleviating high-fat diet-induced liver steatosis in rodents to explore the possibility of a none-drug treatment for the liver condition.Preparing the mice and the sweet cherry anthocyaninsThe sweet cherry anthocyanin was extracted and pulverized, with one mg of the anthocyanin measured to contain amounts of cyanidine-3-rutinoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside, among other things.Thirty male rodents were used for the study. 

- Blood samples were collected and livers collected, rinsed with cold saline, and then weighed.An automatic biochemistry analyser was used to measure total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.They found that at week 15, mice fed a high-fat diet supplemented with sweet cherry anthocyanins “displayed a significant reduction in body weight, liver weight, and liver index” compared to the mice that were only given a high-fat diet without supplementation.They also found the serum levels for tricylglycerol, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in high-fat diet mice to be substantially higher than those fed a low-fat diet, but the group supplemented with the anthocyanin resulted in a significant reduction in these serum parameters.”According to the researchers, the results demonstrated how sweet cherry anthocyanins may be developed into a supplement to “protect from high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice,”leading to a suggested potential for the anthocyanin’s application in the “treatment of hepatic steatosis and other obesity related metabolic disorders.”Healthy lifestyle linked to better cognition for oldest adults -- regardless of genetic riskNew study suggests importance of maintaining healthy lifestyle even after age 80Duke University & Kunshan University (China), June 1, 2021A new analysis of adults aged 80 years and older shows that a healthier lifestyle is associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment, and that this link does not depend on whether a person carries a particular form of the gene APOE. 

- Xurui Jin of Duke Kunshan University in Jiangsu, China, and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journal PLOS Medicine.The APOE gene comes in several different forms, and people with a form known as APOE ε4 have an increased risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. 

- Previous research has also linked cognitive function to lifestyle factors, such as smoking, exercise, and diet. 

- This suggests that maintaining a healthier lifestyle could be important for maintaining cognitive function in adults over 80 years of age, regardless of genetic risk.This cross-sectional study emphasized the importance of a healthy lifestyle on cognitive health. 

- In fact, our doses were 11-times and nearly 25-times lower than those deemed safe by Health Canada and the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration), respectively. 

- "Her message of how to interpret this research is simple:Limit your exposure to BPA the best you can.Maintain smart practices with plastics in your kitchen, for example not heating them, and using glass or stainless steel when possible.This research was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Michael Antle, Ph.D., professor of psychology and member of the HBI.Selenium plus CoQ10 intake associated with reductions in D-dimer and cardiovascular mortalityLinköping University (Sweden), June 2, 2021Findings from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, published on April 17, 2021 in the journal Nutrients,revealed a reduction in D-dimer levels among older Swedish men and women who received selenium and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), as well as a lower risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease in individuals having higher D-dimer levels at baseline.Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant involved in the mitochondria’s production of energy. 

- It also reflects the activity of peripheral artery disease and has been shown to be associated with endothelial dysfunction and inflammation even in the absence of thromboembolism.The current investigation included 213 men and women aged 70 to 88 years who did not have conditions known to influence D-dimer concentrations (e.g., atrial fibrillation, malignancies). 

- “The obtained results also illustrate important associations between inflammation, endothelial function and cardiovascular risk.”Effect of Korean Red Ginseng on Cognitive Function and Quantitative EEG in Alzheimer PatientsSeoul Medical Center  (Korea) June 1, 2021Researchers detail new data in Neurodegenerative Diseases. 

- This study assessed the efficacy of KRG on cognitive function and quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). 

- "The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Seoul Medical Center, "Fourteen patients with AD (mean age, 74.93 years; 11 women and 3 men) were recruited and treated with KRG (4.5 g per day) for 12 weeks. 

- EEG performed before and after treatment were analyzed with quantitative spectral analysis. 

- The FAB score improved significantly after 12 weeks of treatment. 

- Accelerated brain volume loss can be a sign of dementia.The study was published May 26, 2021 in the Journal of Gerontology, Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences.Although people in industrialized nations have access to modern medical care, they are more sedentary and eat a diet high in saturated fats. 

- In contrast, the Tsimane have little or no access to health care but are extremely physically active and consume a high-fiber diet that includes vegetables, fish and lean meat. 

- "The Tsimane have provided us with an amazing natural experiment on the potentially detrimental effects of modern lifestyles on our health," said study author Andrei Irimia, an assistant professor of gerontology, neuroscience and biomedical engineering at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and the USC Viterbi School of Engineering. 

- "These findings suggest that brain atrophy may be slowed substantially by the same lifestyle factors associated with very low risk of heart disease. 

- "Our sedentary lifestyle and diet rich in sugars and fats may be accelerating the loss of brain tissue with age and making us more vulnerable to diseases such as Alzheimer's," said study author Hillard Kaplan, a professor of health economics and anthropology at Chapman University who has studied the Tsimane for nearly two decades. 

- That prior study, published by the Lancet in 2017, showed that Tsimane have the lowest prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis of any population known to science and that they have few cardiovascular disease risk factors. 

- The very low rate of heart disease among the roughly 16,000 Tsimane is very likely related to their pre-industrial subsistence lifestyle of hunting, gathering, fishing, and farming. 

- "This study demonstrates that the Tsimane stand out not only in terms of heart health, but brain health as well," Kaplan said. 

- "The findings suggest ample opportunities for interventions to improve brain health, even in populations with high levels of inflammation.

- Central obesity, or weight carried around the midsection, is a major manifestation of metabolic syndrome and a common health problem in this cohort. 

- The findings are published in Annals of Internal Medicine.Tai chi is a form of mind-body exercise often described as "meditation in motion." 

- While it is known to be a suitable activity for older people including those who are not active, there previously has been little evidence on tai chi's health benefits.Researchers from the University of Hong Kong randomly assigned more than 500 adults over 50 with central obesity to a regimen of tai chi, conventional exercise, or no exercise over 3 months. 

- Participants in the tai chi and exercise groups met for instructor-led workouts for 1 hour 3 times a week for 12 weeks. 

- The tai chi program consisted of the Yang style of tai chi, the most common style adopted in the literature, and the conventional exercise program consisted of brisk walking and strength training activities. 

- Waist circumference and other indicators of metabolic health were measured at baseline, 12 weeks, and 38 weeks. 

- The researchers found that both the tai chi intervention and conventional exercise intervention group had reductions in waist circumference, relative to control. 

- The reduction in waist circumference had a favorable impact on HDL cholesterol, or so-called good cholesterol, but did not translate into detectable differences in fasting glucose or blood pressure.According to the study authors, their findings are good news for middle-aged and older adults who have central obesity but may be averse to conventional exercise due to preference or limited mobility.Prenatal exposure to paracetamol associated with ADHD and autism symptoms in childhoodStudy of more than 70,000 European children bolsters the findings of previous researchBarcelona Institute for Global Health (Spain), May 31, 2021An epidemiological study of more than 70,000 children in six European cohorts has linked symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum conditions (ASC) to the mothers' use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy. 

- The study, published in the European Journal of Epidemiology, was led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a centre supported by the "la Caixa" Foundation.In total, the researchers analysed 73,881 children for whom data were available on prenatal or postnatal exposure to paracetamol, at least one symptom of ASC or ADHD, and main covariates. 

- Mother-Child Cohort in Crete (RHEA)Waking just one hour earlier cuts depression risk by double digitsUniversity of Colorado, May 28, 2021Waking up just one hour earlier could reduce a person's risk of major depression by 23%, suggests a sweeping new genetic study published May 26 in the journal JAMA Psychiatry.The study of 840,000 people, by researchers at University of Colorado Boulder and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, represents some of the strongest evidence yet that chronotype--a person's propensity to sleep at a certain time --influences depression risk.It's also among the first studies to quantify just how much, or little, change is required to influence mental health.As people emerge, post-pandemic, from working and attending school remotely-- a trend that has led many to shift to a later sleep schedule--the findings could have important implications. 

- "Our genetics are set at birth so some of the biases that affect other kinds of epidemiological research tend not to affect genetic studies," said Daghlas, who graduated in May from Harvard Medical School.More than 340 common genetic variants, including variants in the so-called "clock gene" PER2, are known to influence a person's chronotype, and genetics collectively explains 12-42% of our sleep timing preference.The researchers assessed deidentified genetic data on these variants from up to 850,000 individuals, including data from 85,000 who had worn wearable sleep trackers for 7 days and 250,000 who had filled out sleep-preference questionnaires. 

- Overall, the average sleep mid-point was 3 a.m., meaning they went to bed at 11 p.m. and got up at 6 a.m.With this information in hand, the researchers turned to a different sample which included genetic information along with anonymized medical and prescription records and surveys about diagnoses of major depressive disorder.Using novel statistical techniques, they asked: Do those with genetic variants which predispose them to be early risers also have lower risk of depression?The answer is a firm yes.Each one-hour earlier sleep midpoint (halfway between bedtime and wake time) corresponded with a 23% lower risk of major depressive disorder.This suggests that if someone who normally goes to bed at 1 a.m. goes to bed at midnight instead and sleeps the same duration, they could cut their risk by 23%; if they go to bed at 11 p.m., they could cut it by about 40%.It's unclear from the study whether those who are already early risers could benefit from getting up even earlier. 

- "Olive oil nutrient may help prevent brain cancerUniversity of Edinburgh, June 2, 2021A compound found in olive oil may help to prevent cancer developing in the brain, a study shows.Research into oleic acid – the primary ingredient in olive oil – has shown how it can help prevent cancer-causing genes from functioning in cells.The oily substance – one of a group of nutrients known as fatty acids – stimulates the production of a cell molecule whose function is to prevent cancer-causing proteins from forming.The study team says it is too soon to say whether dietary consumption of olive oil may help prevent brain cancer.Their findings, however, point towards possible therapies based on the oil to prevent brain cancer from occurring.Scientists from the University analysed the effect of oleic acid on a cell molecule, known as miR-7, which is active in the brain and is known to suppress the formation of tumours.They found that oleic acid prevents a cell protein, known as MSI2, from stopping production of miR-7.In this way, the olive oil component supports the production of miR-7, which helps prevent tumours from forming.Researchers made their discoveries in tests on human cell extracts and in living cells in the lab.The study, published in the Journal of Molecular Biology, was funded by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust. 

- Further studies could help determine the role that olive oil might have in brain health," says Dr Gracjan Michlewski.Study: Boosting selenium intake can help reduce osteoporosis riskCentral South University (China), May 29, 2021Researchers from China have found that increased selenium intake may reduce a person’s risk for osteoporosis. 

- The majority of the cases were reported among women, with 19.7 percent having been diagnosed with the disease. 

- The factors above were measured as they are considered to be vital for the development and prevention of osteoporosis.But most of all, the team observed a significant difference between the subjects with osteoporosis and those who don’t have the disease in terms of dietary selenium intake. 

- Dietary Se intake within a narrow range optimizes the activity of Se-dependent antioxidant enzymes, whereas both Se-deficiency and Se-excess can adversely impact health. 

- Although relatively less prevalent, Se-excess can also have detrimental consequences and has been implicated in promoting both metabolic and neurodegenerative disease in humans.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Herein, we sought to comprehensively assess the developmental effects of both Se-deficiency and Se-excess on a battery of neurobehavioral and metabolic tests in mice. 

- ***High profile health figures who have attempted to “debunk” the lab origin theory are linked to funding and vaccine research partnerships with China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. 

- taxpayer money supported the controversial vaccine research with Chinese scientists through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). 

- Chronic hyperinsulinemia also promotes cancer growth by allowing insulin to exert its oncogenic effects, which include enhancing growth factor-dependent cell proliferation, among others.The researchers discussed how Chilean maqui berry can help with insulin resistance and reduce cancer risk in an article published in the journal Food Science and Human Wellness.The medicinal benefits of Chilean maqui berryResearchers have long considered nutritional supplementation to be a possible alternative or adjunct treatment to conventional therapies for common ailments and diseases. 

- In fact, numerous studies have shown that diabetics and prediabetics have an elevated risk of developing cancerous growths.Based on the findings of previous studies, the researchers believe that consistent supplementation with Chilean maqui berries could indirectly reduce the risk of cancer and other diseases that are promoted by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and hyperinsulinemia.Studies reveal that social isolation and quarantine throughout the COVID-19 pandemic may have a detrimental impact on physical and mental health of people living with pre-existing conditionsUniversity of Naples (Italy) and Teva Pharmaceuticals, May 30, 2021Abstract 803: Impact of social isolation and quarantine on the course of diabetes mellitus and its complications during Covid 19 pandemic in Adjara Region Country of GeorgiaAbstract 1337: Psychological distress in patients with hypocortisolism during mass quarantine for Covid-19 epidemic in ItalyStudies reveal that social isolation and quarantine throughout the COVID-19 pandemic may have a detrimental impact on people living with pre-existing conditions.Social isolation and quarantine can have a detrimental impact on physical and mental health of people living with pre-existing conditions, according to two studies being presented at the 23rd European Congress of Endocrinology (e-ECE 2021)The studies bring together research on the impact of social isolation and quarantine for people living with diabetes in the Adjara Region of Georgia, and on patients with hypocortisolism in Italy. 

- As these are all contributing factors to overall health deterioration, these findings suggest further research is required to allow patients with pre-existing conditions to remain fit and healthy during the current pandemic.In the Adjara Region study, Dr Liana Jashi and the research team disseminated an online questionnaire and collected answers from 16 endocrinologists and 22 family and general practice doctors. 

- It reported a list of negative effects such as the reduced access to medical care, weight gain and increased cigarette and alcohol consumption. 

- "This study highlights that people living with diabetes require greater support during pandemics to maintain exercise and protect their physical and mental health. 

- National health services should use these data and future studies to implement better social care around supporting people with pre-existing conditions," commented Dr Jashi.In the second study, Dr Chiara Simeoli at the University of Naples reported data collected during the last three weeks of the mass quarantine lasted 2 months in Italy, in a web-survey-based, multicenter, case- control research involving 12 different Italian centres. 

- The study confirmed that a large cohort of 478 patients with hypocortisolism, and particularly, 363 with adrenal insufficiency and 115 with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adequately treated with glucocorticoids, showed higher anxiety and depression, associated with a dissatisfaction feeling of self and a reduced resiliency, when compared with Italian healthy controls, suggesting the detrimental impact of social isolation on mental health of these patients, particularly frail and vulnerable to infections and stress. 

- "These findings confirmed that beyond the huge impact on physical health, COVID-19 epidemic, social isolation and mass quarantine represent significant psychological stressors, causing severe effects on mental health, even more on people with pre-existing conditions. 

- An empowerment of psychological counselling for these vulnerable patients during COVID-19 should be considered by national health-care services," adds Dr Simeoli.Both studies indicate that additional larger studies over a longer period of time are needed for further investigation.Researchers discover link between local oxygen depletion in the brain and Alzheimer's diseaseUniversity of Seville (Spain), May 24, 2021The study, published in the journal Nature Aging and led by the laboratories of Dr. Alberto Pascual (CSIC), from the Neuronal Maintenance Mechanisms Group, and Prof. Javier Vitorica (University of Seville/CIBERNED) of the Physiopathology of Alzheimer's Disease Group at IBiS, demonstrates for the first time that low oxygen levels in the so-called senile plaques in the brain reduces the immune system's defensive capacity against the disease.The study also suggests that this lack of oxygen in the brain enhances the action of disorders associated with Alzheimer's disease that are characterized by low systemic oxygen levels, such as atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases.What happens in the brain?A characteristic feature of Alzheimer's patients is the accumulation of highly toxic substances in their brains, known as senile plaques. 

- In response to Alzheimer's disease, microglia defend neurons by surrounding senile plaques, preventing their spread in the brain and decreasing damage.Alzheimer's disease is aggravated by other pathologies, such as cardiovascular diseases, which cause a decrease in oxygen levels in the body. 

- When this is compounded by reduced oxygen supply to the brain due to other systemic pathologies, the microglia are unable to provide protection and there is an increase in the pathology associated with the disease.RelevanceAlzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia in Spain and around the world. 

- Unfortunately, the origin of the disease remains unknown.The mechanism proposed in this study is mediated by the expression of the HIF1 molecule, whose discoverers received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2019. 

- Increased HIF1 levels compromise the mitochondrial activity of microglial cells and limit their protective capacity against disease.This study opens new lines of research to improve the metabolic capacity of microglia, which would enable a sustained response over time against the disease. 

- Indirectly, the study supports previous work highlighting the importance of maintaining good cardiovascular health for healthy aging.Effect of different doses of melatonin on learning and memory deficit in Alzheimer modelGuilan University of Medical Sciences (Iran), May 21, 2021According to news reporting out of Rasht, Iran, research stated, “Alzheimer Disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder with a progressive impairment of cognitive function. 

- The pineal gland hormone melatonin (MEL) has been known as a protection agent against AD.”Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Guilan University of Medical Sciences: “However, the effect of melatonin in various doses is inconsistent. 

- But 20 mg/kg of melatonin has significantly more effect on the clearance of APP deposition.”Effects of flaxseed on blood pressure, body mass index, and total cholesterol in hypertensive patients: A randomized clinical trialLorestan University of Medical Sciences (Iran), May 25, 2021ObjectivesGiven the antioxidant properties of flaxseed and its biologically active ingredients, this study was conducted to determine the effects of flaxseed supplementation on body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and total cholesterol levels in patients with hypertension.MethodsIn this triple-blind clinical trial, 112 patients, with an age range of 35 to 70 years, were randomized to 2 groups receiving 10 g (n=45) and 30 g (n=45) of flaxseed supplementation and 1 group receiving placebo (n=45) for 12 weeks by stratified block randomization. 

- However, it had little effect on performance on the placekeeping task for most participants," Fenn said.She added: "Caffeine may improve the ability to stay awake and attend to a task, but it doesn't do much to prevent the sort of procedural errors that can cause things like medical mistakes and car accidents. 

- "Parkinson's disease more likely in people with depression, study suggestsUmea University (Sweden), May 21 2021People with depression may be more likely to develop the movement disorder Parkinson's disease, according to new research published in Neurology.According to the authors of the study, depression is more common in people with Parkinson's disease than those without the movement disorder. 

- "We saw this link between depression and Parkinson's disease over a timespan of more than 2 decades, so depression may be a very early symptom of Parkinson's disease or a risk factor for the disease," says study co-author Prof. Peter Nordström, at Umeå University in Sweden.Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects how a person moves, including how they speak and write. 

- As well as problems with movement, Parkinson's disease can also cause cognitive problems, neurobehavioral problems and sensory difficulties.The authors of the study state that depression is more common in patients with Parkinson's disease than in members of the general population. 

- The mood disorder has a major influence on health-related quality of life and could also be involved in more rapid deterioration of cognitive and motor functions.However, few studies have investigated this association for periods of longer than 10 years, with any long-term findings so far inconclusive.For the study, the researchers used a cohort consisting of all Swedish citizens aged 50 years and above as of December 31st, 2005. 

- A total of 1,485 people with depression (1.1%) developed Parkinson's disease during this time, compared with 1,775 of those who did not have depression (0.4%).On average, Parkinson's disease was diagnosed 4.5 years after the beginning of the study, with the likelihood of the disorder developing decreasing over time.No sibling link found for depression and Parkinson's diseaseThe researchers calculated that participants with depression were 3.2 times more likely than those without depression to develop Parkinson's disease within a year of the study beginning. 

- After 15-25 years, the researchers found participants with depression were almost 50% more likely to develop the condition.If a participant's depression was severe, their likelihood of developing Parkinson's disease was also higher. 

- For example, those who had been hospitalized for depression five or more times were 40% more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than participants who had been hospitalized for depression just once.In addition to these observations, the researchers examined siblings. 

- No link was found between one sibling having Parkinson's disease and the other having depression. 

- Depression or antidepressive treatment could increase the risk of Parkinson's disease, depression could be an early symptom of Parkinson's disease, or that the two conditions could share environmental causative factors.In the paper, the authors acknowledge that they are unable to evaluate the potential role of substances used in antidepressive treatment as risk factors for Parkinson's disease. 

- "Our findings suggest a direct association between depression and subsequent [Parkinson's disease], supported by a time-dependent hazard ratio, a dose-response pattern for recurrent depression, and a lack of evidence for coaggregation among siblings," the authors conclude. 

- "Given that the association was significant over more than two decades of follow-up, depression may be a very early prodromal symptom of or a causal risk factor for [Parkinson's disease]. 

- "Elsewhere, a study published in December previously suggested that users of methamphetamine are at three times more risk of getting Parkinson's disease than people who do not use illegal drugs. 

- With almost  a million members, the Association is a non profit public interest organization campaigning for sustainable health and justice on critical issues of food safety, industrial agriculture, genetic engineering, Fair Trade and environmental sustainability. 

- “Ultimately,” Joe Biden declared during another gaff remark about the status of the government’s vaccination campaign, “those who are not vaccinated will pay – end up paying the price.” Despite the dubious claims that the mRNA vaccines are approximately 95 percent effective, the unvaccinated therefore mysteriously pose a health risk to the vaccinated. 

- Even the staunch pro-Zionist New York Times indicated the government’s policies are “moving in the direction of a two-tier system for the vaccinated and unvaccinated.”An analysis comparing Israeli Covid-19 infection and vaccine-related deaths conducted by Dr. Herve Seligmann, an Israeli-national at Aix-Marseille University of Medicine’s Faculty of Emerging Infectious and Tropical Diseases, concluded that the Pfizer vaccine has caused “mortality hundreds of times greater in young people compare[d] to the mortality from coronavirus without the vaccine, and dozens of times more in the elderly, when the documented mortality from coronavirus is in the vicinity of the vaccine, thus adding greater mortality from heart attack, stroke, etc.”  Seligmann and his co-author Haim Yativ have referred to Netanyahu’s draconian policies with unsafe experimental vaccines as a “new Holocaust.”  A civilian organization, the Israeli People Committee, which includes many health professionals, released a devastating report on the number of injuries and deaths resulting from Pfizer’s vaccine. 

- However, thousands of medical school professors, physicians and researchers worldwide are challenging this non-consensual assumption. 

- Thirty-three percent of the American population was therefore excluded from the study because, according to the CDC, only 66.8 percent of the population has private health insurance. 

- New York University researchers reported in the British Medical Journal that a third of patients receiving methotrexate and TNF-inhibitors for immune-mediated inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis fail to achieve sufficient antibodies from the Pfizer vaccine. 

- On the other hand, there are over 100 different autoimmune conditions, including type-1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, blood cancers, lupus, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid and other types of arthritis, psoriasis, IgG4 disease, Hashimoto’s and Addison’s diseases, celiac disease, etc. 

- Every year, nearly two-thirds of all Americans require emergency medical care from allergic reactions alone. 

- It is not irrational, therefore, to suspect that past and present Covid-19 trials have been conducted with malice of forethought and with the unconditional approval of our federal health officials.During the pandemic, the rapid ascent of our vaccine-addicted culture’s mantra of “vaccination at any cost” truly borders on medical malfeasance and criminal negligence. 

- If our health policymakers were wise men and women, alternative treatments such as ivermectin, hydroxycholoroquine, and more recent inexpensive off-patent drugs, which have been shown to be highly effective for early stage treatment and being widely prescribed elsewhere in the world, would be permitted and encouraged without reservation. 

- This is just another example of the institutionalized pathology that infects our health agencies.There is no convincing science to support our federal officials belief that a previously infected person requires a Covid-19 vaccine to acquire immunity. 

- Instead of open dialogue and debate, those who challenge the Medical Church Scientific are censored by Google and from all social platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and Wikipedia. 

- This is despite the impeccable credentials of many medical professionals abiding by the precautionary principle and who dare to challenge Anthony Fauci and the global vaccine czar Bill Gates, whose faux philanthropy is nothing less than another profitmaking enterprise like Microsoft.Conflicts of interests, both financial and non-financial, are endemic in our medical system. 

- Therefore it becomes increasingly more difficult to trust any clinical study or government policy that is based upon flawed evidence submitted by a drug maker that fails to undergo a thorough independent and impartial review by qualified medical experts. 

- Many psychologists have pointed out over the years that “cognitive bias,” “motivated reasoning” and the heuristics driving the evaluation of clinical trial data and the subsequent institutional regulatory review and decision-making are deeply contrary and undermine the entire evidence-based criteria that should oversee what drugs, vaccines, medical devices, therapeutic protocols should be recommended or approved for use upon the public.The late Scott Lilienfeld, a professor of psychology at Emory University, writes, “Clinicians are subject to the same errors in thinking that affect virtually all people. 

- Writing about the deep ethical concerns behind bias in our medical institutions, Dr. Thomas Murray, President of the Hastings Center, states, “For scientists on a panel of the Food and Drug Administration, for example, it isn’t immediately clear to whom they owe their primary loyalty.”  Such biases, Murray believes, have completely destroyed the credibility of the World Health Organization.The fact that rates to reproduce medical clinical trials are so poor, according to behavioral economist Susann Fielder at the Max Planck Institute, is that “cognitive biases may be a reason for that.”  It also explains why Stanford University Medical School professor John Ioannidis argues, “most published research findings are false,” and “an estimated 85 percent of research resources are wasted.” Junk science based upon bias should also include every vaccine application submitted to the FDA for regulatory approval, since the vaccine companies are privileged to cherry-pick whichever trials they want to submit to create the most promising portfolio.One could review all of the official decisions made during the past 17 months – by Anthony Fauci, Trump and Biden and the naïve stances in both political parties – and should easily observe the frailties of cognitive bias and repeated contradictions throughout. 

- And it has been a very deadly experiment due to the extraordinary incompetence of our medical-degreed bureaucrats. 

- Sadly the decades of institutional ineptitude has had to reach national and perhaps global awareness at this time when the powers that possess every technological tool at their disposal to conduct wide surveillance, pass undemocratic and draconian laws with full impunity, and control the fenced sheep within the mainstream media.Attachments area
I Never Trusted Bill Gates, Nor Should YouWhile leading a Senate investigation, I tracked a corrupt pharmaceutical executive right into the lobby of the much-vaunted Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation—Bill Gates did nothing.The DisInformation Chronicle,https://disinformationchronicle.substack.com/p/i-never-trusted-bill-gates-nor-shouldThe last year has not been kind to Bill Gates.For two decades, Gates has shoveled out buckets of cash through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to transform himself from despised 1990’s software monopolist to a present-day public health intellectual—a miraculous, money-fueled metamorphosis. 

- During this federal investigation, I uncovered multiple examples of GSK officials intimidating medical experts who decried the drug’s dangers. 

- A leader in this campaign was GSK’s chairman of research and development, Dr. Tadataka (Tachi) Yamada.By the time our committee uncovered GSK’s coercion campaign, Yamada had left the company to run Gates’ global health program. 

- And yet, as the media outlets reported on Yamada’s prior role bullying physicians who tried to warn about the drug’s dangers, the Gates Foundation ignored this public outcry and allowed Yamada to maintain his pulpit as global health protector.Twenty years back, journalists scrutinized Gates’ foundation as a vehicle to enrich himself and polish his appearance. 

- But over the years, reporters began to forget Gates’ past and provide him a platform to puff himself up as scientific expert, despite his having no medical or scientific credentials. 

- Bill Gates’ sculpted persona as health policy guru began to wobble last summer, however, precisely because of revelations showing the tools he had used to improve his media cachet.In August 2020, Tim Schwab published an article in the Columbia Journalism Review exposing around $250 million in grants that Gates was throwing at journalism outlets including the BBC, NBC, Al Jazeera, ProPublica, National Journal, The Guardian, Univision, Medium, the Financial Times, The Atlantic, the Texas Tribune, Gannett, Washington Monthly, Le Monde, and the Center for Investigative Reporting.A later article in The Nation spotlighted Gates’ potential to profit from investments in companies situated to reap a windfall from the COVID pandemic. 

- And another report in The Nation found that Gates’ funding has stifled debate in public health—described as “the Bill chill”—as organizations are reluctant to bite the hand that feeds them.These revelations came as little surprise to me. 

- Just in case Gates was too distracted with saving the world and playing public health saviour to have noticed the bad press, I had the letter sent directly to the Gates Foundation.When Dr. Yamada showed up for his appointment in Senate Hart, we started with some brief niceties and formalities—typical DC nonsense such as shaking hands, passing out business cards, asking how the plane flight was—before getting down to business. 

- ""Yes," he replied.I let him drone on some more, explaining medical research, before I asked him again if he had ever called a university to complain about a professor. 

- He remained in his role as global health expert at the Gates Foundation, until he left the following year, in June 2011.Keeping someone like Yamada to run a global health program has always made me doubt Bill Gates’ commitment to public health. 

- If these findings, published today in Cell Reports Medicine, are confirmed in clinical trials, they could point the way toward the use of beta-sitosterol as a treatment for relieving anxiety in humans.Anxiety is not always a bad thing. 

- "Benfotiamine, vitamin B derivative, intake associated with reduced progression of cognitive declineWeil Cornell Medicine, May 20, 2021A randomized phase II trial reported in 2020 in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease resulted in positive effects among individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer’s dementia who were given capsules that contained benfotiamine, a derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1).The trial included 70 cognitively impaired men and women who received physical examinations and completed the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) prior to enrollment. 

- Prospective candidates received positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans of the brain to confirm the presence of amyloid plaques that are characteristic of Alzheimer disease) and other general blood tests, an electrocardiogram and neurological exam prior to enrollment. 

- The presence of one or two copies of the APOE4 variant of the APOE gene is associated with a greater risk of Alzheimer disease in comparison with APOE2 or APOE3.Blood testing conducted at the beginning and end of the trial measured levels of vitamin B1 and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are formed when fats or proteins react with sugar in the blood. 

- (Research suggests that AGEs are predictive of long-term decline in cognition-related daily living performance in Alzheimer disease patients.) 

- Cognitive tests, including the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Clinical Dementia Rating and others were administered at the beginning of the study and at varying time points thereafter. 

- Participants received capsules containing 300 milligrams benfotiamine or a placebo twice daily for one year.At the end of the treatment period, thiamine levels were significantly elevated in the benfotiamine-intake group. 

- The 12 month increase in Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale scores (indicating increased cognitive dysfunction) was lower among those who received benfotiamine compared to the placebo group. 

- We believe that further studies would be very valuable to determine whether benfotiamine may be helpful in delaying onset or treating Alzheimer disease.”'45 is the new 50' as age for colorectal cancer screening is loweredDana Farber Cancer Institute, May 21, 2021BOSTON - Prompted by a recent alarming rise in cases of colorectal cancer in people younger than 50, an independent expert panel has recommended that individuals of average risk for the disease begin screening exams at 45 years of age instead of the traditional 50.The guideline changes by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), published in the current issue of JAMA, updates its 2016 recommendations and aligns them with those of the American Cancer Society, which lowered the age for initiation of screening to 45 years in 2018.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most preventable malignancies, owing to its long natural history of progression and the availability of screening tests that can intercept and detect the disease early. 

- Ng is the director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.The causes of the increase in young-onset CRC aren't currently known.Lowering the recommended age to initiate screening "will make colorectal cancer screening, which is so important, available to millions more people in the United States, and hopefully many more lives will be saved by catching colorectal cancer earlier, as well as by preventing colorectal cancer," said Ng.The USPSTF is an independent panel of experts funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 

- American health insurance groups are required to cover, at no charge to the patient, any service that the USPSTF recommends with a grade A or B level of evidence, regardless of how much it costs.The task force recommendation means that insurers will be required to cover preventive procedures such as colonoscopies and stool tests designed to detect colon cancer in early stages.The task force selected age 45 based on research showing that initiating screening at that age averted more early deaths than starting at age 50, with a relatively small increase in the number of colonoscopy complications. 

- Employers could provide 45-year-old employees with a paid "wellness day" to undergo CRC screening, or offer day care or transportation vouchers to overcome the logistical hurdles of colonoscopies. 

- Health systems could offer weekend or after-hours appointments for colonoscopies.The new recommendation "represents an important policy change," the authors wrote, "to drive progress toward reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. 

- "Study Finds New and Effective Treatment for Vitamin D DeficiencyBoston University School of Medicine, May 20, 2021There are several million people worldwide with various fat malabsorption syndromes including those who have undergone gastric bypass surgery and those with obesity. 

- Now a new study demonstrates 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 is an effective treatment for vitamin D deficiency for these specific patients.According to the researchers, approximately one third of adults are obese and require much larger doses of vitamin D to satisfy their requirement. 

- "Therefore using 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 could be a novel approach for treating vitamin D deficiency in patients with fat malabsorption syndromes and obese adults," added Holick.Vitamin D deficiency not only results in bone loss increasing risk for fracture but causes the painful bone disease osteomalacia. 

- Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of many chronic illnesses including multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, neurocognitive dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease as well as infectious diseases including COVID.These findings appear online in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Young teens should only use recreational internet and video games one hour dailyRutgers University, May 24, 2021Middle-school aged children who use the internet, social media or video games recreationally for more than an hour each day during the school week have significantly lower grades and test scores, according to a study from the Center for Gambling Studies at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.The findings appear in the journal Computers in Human Behavior.Researchers say the findings give parents and children a moderate threshold for using entertainment-related technology -- no more than one hour daily on school days and four hours a day on weekends. 

- This gene is involved in three areas important to the health of cells: coordinating the cell’s response to DNA damage, encouraging damaged cells to undergo programmed cell death and managing the amount of dangerous reactive oxygen species within a cell. 

- This gene is known to be important for the proper crosstalk between the cell nucleus and mitochondria - the energy-production factories in our cells whose dysfunction is a key factor in aging.Additionally, the same region of the genome is linked to an increased expression of BLVRA in some tissues - a gene that is important to the health of cells due to its role in eliminating dangerous reactive oxygen species.“Previous studies showed that DNA repair is one of the mechanisms allowing an extended lifespan across species,” says Cristina Giuliani, Senior Assistant Professor at the Laboratory of Molecular Anthropology, Department of Biological, Geological and Environmental Sciences, University of Bologna, and a senior author of the study. 

- These individuals appeared to avoid the age-related increase in disruptive mutations, and this may have contributed in protecting them against diseases such as heart disease.“This study constitutes the first whole-genome sequencing of extreme longevity at high coverage that allowed us to look at both inherited and naturally occurring genetic changes in older people,” says Massimo Delledonne, Full Professor at the University of Verona and a first author of the study.“Our results suggest that DNA repair mechanisms and a low burden of mutations in specific genes are two central mechanisms that have protected people who have reached extreme longevity from age-related diseases,” concludes senior author Claudio Franceschi, Professor Emeritus of Immunology at the University of Bologna.Your Risk of Dying Hinges on Well-Being Not DiseasesUniversity of Chicago, May 18, 2021A new study has yielded a radically different picture of aging in America, finding that how old you are plays little or no role in determining differences in health and well-being.The researchers say the results suggest the medical community is focusing on the wrong set of factors to determine risk of dying. 

- Rather than rely on a checklist of infirmities—heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and cholesterol levels—perhaps it’s time to consider a new “comprehensive model” that looks at factors such as psychological well-being, sensory function, and mobility.“The new comprehensive model of health identifies constellations of health completely hidden by the medical model and reclassifies about half of the people seen as healthy as having significant vulnerabilities that affect the chances that they may die or become incapacitated within five years,” says Professor Martha McClintock, a biopsychologist and lead author of the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.“At the same time, some people with chronic disease are revealed as having many strengths that lead to their reclassification as quite healthy, with low risks of death and incapacity,” adds Professor Linda Waite, a demographer and study coauthor.The study is a major longitudinal survey of a representative sample of 3,000 people between the ages of 57 to 85 conducted by the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago.SOME OF THE FINDINGS INCLUDE:Cancer itself is not related to other conditions that undermine health.Poor mental health, which afflicts one in eight older adults, undermines healthin ways not previously recognized.Obesity seems to pose little risk to older adults with excellent physical and mental health.Sensory function and social participation play critical roles in sustaining or undermining health.Breaking a bone after age 45 is a major marker for future healthissues.Older men and women have different patterns of healthand well-being during aging.Mobility is one of the best markers of well-being.The comprehensive model reflects a definition of health long advanced, but little studied, by the World Health Organization, which considers health to include psychological, social, and physical factors in addition to the diseases that are the basis for the current medical model of health.THE HEALTHIEST 22%Twenty-two percent of older Americans were in the model’s healthiest category. 

- This group was typified by higher obesity and blood pressure, but had fewer organ system diseases, better mobility, sensory function, and psychological health. 

- They had the lowest prevalence of dying or becoming incapacitated (six percent) five years into the study.A second category had normal weight, low prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, but had one minor disease such as thyroid disease, peptic ulcers, or anemia. 

- They were twice as likely to have died or become incapacitated within five years.Two emerging vulnerable classes of health traits, completely overlooked by the medical model, included 28 percent of the older population. 

- A second new class had mental health problems, in addition to poor sleep patterns, engaged in heavy drinking, had a poor sense of smell, and walked slowly, all of which correlate with depression.The most vulnerable older people were in two classes—one characterized by immobility and uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension. 

- A majority of people in each of these categories were women, who tend to outlive men.“From a health system perspective, a shift of attention is needed from disease-focused management, such as medications for hypertension or high cholesterol, to overall well-being across many areas,” says William Dale, associate professor of medicine and a member of the research team.“Instead of policies focused on reducing obesity as a much lamented health condition, greater support for reducing loneliness among isolated older adults or restoring sensory functions would be more effective in enhancing health and well-being in the older population,” says Edward Laumann, also a collaborator and sociology professor. 

- Western diet may increase risk of gut inflammation, infectionDiet rich in sugar, fat damages immune cells in digestive tracts of miceWashington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Cleveland ClinicEating a Western diet impairs the immune system in the gut in ways that could increase risk of infection and inflammatory bowel disease, according to a study from researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Cleveland Clinic.The study, in mice and people, showed that a diet high in sugar and fat causes damage to Paneth cells, immune cells in the gut that help keep inflammation in check. 

- When Paneth cells aren't functioning properly, the gut immune system is excessively prone to inflammation, putting people at risk of inflammatory bowel disease and undermining effective control of disease-causing microbes. 

- "Inflammatory bowel disease has historically been a problem primarily in Western countries such as the U.S., but it's becoming more common globally as more and more people adopt Western lifestyles," said lead author Ta-Chiang Liu, MD, PhD, an associate professor of pathology & immunology at Washington University. 

- "Our research showed that long-term consumption of a Western-style diet high in fat and sugar impairs the function of immune cells in the gut in ways that could promote inflammatory bowel disease or increase the risk of intestinal infections. 

- "Paneth cell impairment is a key feature of inflammatory bowel disease. 

- For example, people with Crohn's disease, a kind of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea, anemia and fatigue, often have Paneth cells that have stopped working.Liu and senior author Thaddeus Stappenbeck, MD, PhD, chair of the Department of Inflammation and Immunity at Cleveland Clinic, set out to find the cause of Paneth cell dysfunction in people. 

- The association held for healthy adults and people with Crohn's disease.To better understand this connection, the researchers studied two strains of mice that are genetically predisposed to obesity. 

- They also have begun studying ways to restore normal Paneth cell function and improve gut immunity by targeting the bile acid or the two immune molecules.Glutathione precursor gamma-glutamylcysteine may represent novel strategy for treatment and/or prevention of cognitive impairmentUniversity of New South Wales(Australia), May 12, 2021According to news originating from Sydney, Australia, research stated, “The accumulation of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and abnormal aggregation of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) have been shown to induce synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 

- Spatial memory was also improved by gamma-GC as determined using the Morris water maze.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Our data collectively suggested that supplementation with gamma-GC may represent a novel strategy for the treatment and/or prevention of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Study led by NTU Singapore finds that microbes work as a network in causing lung infectionNanyang Technological University (Singapore) May 21, 201Traditionally, an infection is thought to happen when microbes - bacteria, fungi, or viruses - enter and multiply in the body, and its severity is associated with how prevalent the microbes are in the body.Now, an international research team led by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) has proposed a new way of understanding infections. 

- Applying this precision-medicine approach can help the managing physician better understand and choose the most appropriate antibiotic or other therapy to confer clinical benefit - in short, to guide us to the right treatment at the right time, and for the best outcome. 

- "Microbial interactions and infectionFor their study, the scientists looked at patients with bronchiectasis, a disease of high Asian prevalence, where airways dilate irreversibly and, where infection promotes progression. 

- While changes to interactions between microbes during flare-ups was detected, there was surprisingly minimal change to the type and quantity of microbes present during a flare-up, and even after antibiotics were administered.New treatment possibilitiesThe scientists believe that these findings suggest that microbial interactions potentially drive frequent flare-ups in patients.Using these findings, the scientists have developed an online tool to help other researchers and physicians analyse microbial interactions in their own patient samples through the microbes' genetic sequences.Asst Prof Chotirmall, who is also NTU Provost's Chair in Molecular Medicine, said: "We are proposing a fresh way to view infection, as networks rather than individual microbes. 

- "The team is currently exploring the use of probiotics to treat bronchiectasis by regulating microbiomes within the air passages.Pea flour helps malnourished children regain weight and restores gut floraImperial College London, May 21, 201Adding pea flour to foods for severely malnourished children helps them gain weight and restores the balance of microbes in their gut.In a small study of severely malnourished children in Uganda, researchers found that providing them with a mix containing cowpea flour improved their ability to absorb nutrients and gain weight, while maintaining their gut microbiome comparable to healthy children.According to the researchers, the findings, published today in the journal Cell Reports Medicine, lay the foundations for larger trials with cowpea-based supplements and highlight the critical role of gut health in restoring nutrition in children with severe acute malnutrition.Acute malnutrition is a major contributor to child mortality around the world. 

- It remains a leading cause of death in children under five years of age and increases their risk of life-threatening events such as pneumonia, diarrheal disease or infections. 

- Children with severe acute malnutrition can be treated with nutrient-rich, milk-based formulas to restore weight and nutrition, but despite treatment many will later go on to die.Professor Gary Frost, head of the Center for Translational Nutrition and Food Research at Imperial College London, said: "These are children who have been admitted to hospital and often have other disease, such as bacterial sepsis, which complicates the picture—so they are very fragile. 

- "More than 'calories in'Researchers at Imperial College London have been exploring the links between gut health and nutrition, with the aim of improving outcomes for severely malnourished children. 

- Without this regular supply of nutrients, the gut lining deteriorates and becomes 'leaky," reducing our ability to absorb nutrients and increasing the risk of bugs entering the bloodstream where they can cause infection.Previous research by the Imperial team has shown that increasing dietary fiber can help to overcome this 'leaky gut' syndrome and improve the absorption of nutrients, so they designed and tested a new feed fortified with cowpea—which contains a source of easily fermentable carbohydrates and fiber, both known to be key in maintaining gut health.In a small proof of concept trial, researchers recruited 58 hospitalized children in Uganda with severe acute malnutrition to receive one of three feeds: a conventional feed; a feed containing the plant compound inulin; and a feed fortified with cowpea flour. 

- Children in all three groups received antibiotics and other medical treatments, as needed, in addition to the feed.Led by Ph.D. candidates Nuala Calder and Kevin Walsh, the team measured changes to weight after seven days of treatment, along with fecal sampling to look at changes to the makeup of their gut microbiome. 

- However, the cowpea feed limited the damage to gut microbes associated with antibiotic treatment—which can reduce the richness of the microbiome by killing off key groups of bugs. 

- The same effect was not seen in conventional feeds or those enriched with inulin—a compound derived from plants—highlighting the role of fiber and other elements in the legume feed.Following 28 days, there was limited difference in mortality between the groups, and sadly, despite treatment 12 children died (3, 6 and 3 from the respective groups). 

- But analysis suggested that across the groups, children that died had higher levels of gut dysfunction and altered levels of short chain fatty acids, indicating reduced diversity of gut microbes.Protecting gut bugsProfessor Frost said: "Our major finding was that the cowpea enriched feeds actually protect the gut bugs when these children are given antibiotics, so we know that the feed is actually helping the microbiota to survive some of the concurrent medical therapy these children are receiving. 

- "Professor Kathryn Maitland, Professor of Tropical Pediatric Infectious Disease at Imperial and based in Kenya, said: "This is a very small study, but it's an important first step. 

- Many of these children may receive multiple antibiotics, which kills the microbiota, leaving only the microbes that are bad for human health, and these legume enriched feeds may actually help to resist that. 

- It's not just about the nutrients flowing in, it's about how compounds in plants are metabolized, and underlying gut health. 

- "Why blueberries are an effective weapon in the war against Alzheimer’s diseaseUniversity of Cincinnati,  May 21, 2021Could a plump, little blueberry really hold colossal promise in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease? 

- New research adds to the growing evidence that blueberries, bursting with antioxidants, could help diminish the devastating defects of dementia.Blueberries are already known as a “super fruit,” thanks to their documented contribution to lowering the risk of heart disease and cancer. 

- But now, newly released study findings show that certain flavonoids found in blueberries could also hold the key to lessening the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.Over 5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, a number that is expected to continue to rise as the population ages. 

- The Alzheimer’s Association estimates that as many as 7 million could fall prey to the disease by 2025, and that the number could triple by 2050. 

- It is an extremely costly disease as well. 

- Experts estimate that Alzheimer’s will cost the nation $236 million and that caregivers will spend more than $5,000 a year trying to care for their loved one.Hope for Alzheimer’s disease patients: Blueberries found to improve cognition and memoryAs scientists work to slow this alarming trend, researchers out of the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center have released promising results of two human studies conducted in follow up to their earlier clinical trials. 

- Known as anthocyanins, they have been shown to improve cognition in tests with animals.In one study, 47 adults, aged 68 and older, exhibiting mild cognitive impairment – a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease – were given either freeze-dried blueberry powder or a placebo powder once a day for 16 weeks. 

- Reproductive health professionals and researchers fittingly started searching for antioxidants to combat this imbalance. 

- Considering the importance of Vitamin D on reproductive functions, its role in causing Oxidative stress and gonadal dysfunction, we suggest randomized control trials in pre-pubertal phase.Want to escape Alzheimer's disease? 

- Run for your life and exerciseTel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Israel), May 20, 2021Exercise slows down aging of the brain and can reduce risks of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias by about half.There is a growing amount of medical evidence that exercise slows down the aging of the brain and can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias by about half, according to Prof. Nir Giladi, chief of neurology at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.He said that the modern sedentary way of life reduces the amount of body movement. 

- Long-term epidemiological and physical studies show that exercise can improve memory, concentration and mood and minimize pain, as well as reduce the risk of cognitive damage, stroke, Parkinson's disease and depression.The connection between exercise and brain function was first disclosed from animal studies two decades ago, said Giladi. 

- Exercise causes these to multiply, said Giladi. 

- The neurologist added that for some unknown reason, the best potential for differentiation exists in brain regions responsible for memory.Exercise promotes the secretion of trophic factors -- including brain-derived neurotrophic factor that encourage the growth of stem cells that turn into adult nerve cells. 

- "This is why those who exercise regularly look and have younger brain function -- and their cells are more protected from diseases, trauma and natural aging. 

- "Giladi said it was best to do aerobic exercise (causing the heart and lungs to exert themselves) along with non-aerobic exercise (strengthening the muscles on the skeleton) at least three times a week. 

- Even if you exercise just as an adult and the cognitive decline has begun, your physical activity will slow down the rate of decline.A study published in the journal PNAS  using MRI to see the effect of regular exercise on the brain showed that the brains of healthy 75-year-olds who performed physical activity at least three times a week declined slower in the regions of memory, concentration, planning, initiative and management abilities. 

- Exercise influences the brain cell in deciding which genes will function and contribute to this and which will be neutralized. 

- This is thus epigenetics, in which the environment actually affects the genes, the neurologist said.Exercise also increases the supply of blood to the organs, including the brain, he continued, and encourages the growth of alternate blood vessels to take over functions from clogged vessels.He bemoaned the fact that many Israelis don't exercise regularly. 

- An average of 150 to 300 minutes per week -- half aerobic and half non-aerobic -- can improve the abilities of the brain and protect it from disease, Giladi concluded. 

- Diabetics who received 1 g of vitamin C daily showed improvements in blood pressure, oxidative stressKhon Kaen University (Thailand), May 21, 2021Findings from a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial reported on February 25, 2021 in the Chinese Journal of Physiology revealed an association between intake of vitamin C and a reduction in blood pressure before and after exercise among men and women with type 2 diabetes. 

- “During exercise, mechanical stress on the arterial wall is increased, leading to an increased release of vasodilators by the endothelium (e.g., nitric oxide, bradykinin, etc. 

- “This response can attenuate blood pressure (BP) after acute exercise at low, moderate, and high intensity in normotensive individuals. 

- However, the magnitude of this effect seems to decline in type 2 diabetes patients because of endothelial dysfunction.”The trial included 24 type 2 diabetics with poorly controlled disease who received 1,000 milligrams vitamin C or a placebo daily for six weeks, followed by a six-week washout period, followed by six weeks of the alternate intervention. 

- For inclusion in the study, participants were required to have a blood pressure of ≤140/90 mmHg or less, maintained if necessary with antihypertensive treatment.Twenty-minute low-intensity exercise sessions were conducted on the day before and the last day of each treatment period. 

- Blood pressure was measured before, immediately after and 60 minutes after the exercise sessions. 

- Blood samples collected before and after exercise were analyzed for plasma vitamin C levels, markers of lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide concentration.Compared to pre-intake, participants who received vitamin C experienced an average 12.8 mmHg reduction in systolic BP and an 8.9 mmHg reduction in diastolic BP when at rest before exercise. 

- Immediately after exercise, systolic and diastolic BP were lower by 11.4 mmHg and 6.8 mmHg, and an hour after exercise, systolic and diastolic BP were lower by 12.5 mmHg and 8.9 mmHg in the vitamin C group compared to baseline values. 

- No significant differences between pre- and post-treatment measurements occurred in the placebo group. 

- When compared to the placebo, participants who received vitamin C also had lower systolic and diastolic BP before and after the post-supplementation exercise sessions.Post-intake, plasma vitamin C and nitric oxide levels were higher, and markers of lipid peroxidation were lower among vitamin C patients before and immediately after exercise compared to baseline, while the placebo group experienced no significant changes. 

- And when compared to the placebo, vitamin C and nitric oxide were higher and lipid peroxidation markers were lower before and after the exercise session among participants who had received the vitamin.In their discussion of the findings, the authors remarked that vitamin C’s ability to decrease oxidative stress helps prevent nitric oxide from being degraded by free radicals, which results in higher nitric oxide levels that benefit endothelial function and BP. 

- They announced that the study is the first to report the effect of vitamin C compared to a placebo on BP before and within an hour after exercise. 

- “This study suggests that 6‑week vitamin C [intake] decreased pre-exercise and postexercise blood pressures, possibly due to improved oxidative stress and nitric oxide release,” they concluded.Making mindfulness meditation more helpful starts with understanding how it can be harmfulBrown University, May 18, 2021Mindfulness-based meditation programs have emerged as a promising treatment for conditions ranging from stress to sleeplessness to depression. 

- "In order to address risks and modify treatment accordingly, you need thorough and detailed knowledge about potential harms. 

- For the study, she and her colleagues reviewed the most current harms monitoring best practices from regulatory agencies like the World Health Organization, the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 

- In the paper, they outlined the key considerations around assessing adverse effects, including hesitancy of participants to report negative reactions to treatment because of feelings of shame or a desire to please the researcher or instructor.Researchers and mindfulness teachers (Britton is both) are understandably more focused on the help they can provide than any harm they could cause. 

- What's more, Britton added, the literature shows that mental health treatment providers (like therapists or doctors) may dismiss patient complaints or reframe them as a sign that the therapy is working.Designing a model assessmentBritton's research team followed 24 current harms monitoring guidelines to assess the nature and frequency of meditation-related adverse effects in mindfulness-based programs. 

- After completing one of three versions of an eight-week mindfulness meditation program, participants were interviewed by a researcher unaffiliated with the treatment about their experiences, with 44 questions based on previous research of meditation-related challenges.To more accurately and thoroughly capture patient perspectives, this study allowed each participant to evaluate the emotional tone or "valence" of each of 44 meditation-related experiences as well as the impact it had on their life and functioning. 

- "Vitamin B6, vitamin D and green tea compound could improve uterine fibroidsSandro Pertini Hospital (Italy), May 19, 2021In an article whose title asks the question, “Uterine fibroids treatment: do we have new valid alternative?” findings from researchers from Sandro Pertini Hospital in Rome suggest the answer may be “yes.”The article, published in the April 2021 issue of the European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences reported a benefit for intake of vitamin B6, vitamin D and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, a flavonoid that occurs in green tea) in women with uterine fibroids (myomas), benign tumors of the uterus that affect a significant percentage of reproductive-aged women. 

- Uterine fibroids adversely impact fertility, and unfortunately, there are few treatment options for women who desire to become pregnant.The study included 95 women who had between one and five fibroids. 

- The number and volume of fibroids was measured using ultrasound before and after the treatment period. 

- Other factors assessed at these time points included the presence of heavy bleeding, pelvic pain and health/quality of life. 

- Overall improvement was assessed by a questionnaire, the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), administered to participants who completed the four-month study.After four months, total fibroid volume significantly decreased by 37.9% among participants who received vitamins B6 and D, plus ECGC, while increasing by 5.5% among women who did not receive the nutrients. 

- Pelvic pain and health, including the participants’ all-over impressions of improvement, significantly improved in comparison with pretreatment levels in the group that received the nutrients while no change occurred in the control group. 

- Thus, this…may represent a valid alternative to the classic ‘wait and see’ approach and, at the same time, an adjuvant treatment that could be administered along with pharmacological therapies, even before surgery to reduce the occurrence of possible complications.”Nitrate-Rich Vegetables Increase Plasma Nitrate and Nitrite Concentrations and Lower Blood Pressure in Healthy AdultsMaastricht University (Netherlands), May 21, 2021Background: Dietary nitrate is receiving increased attention due to its reported ergogenic and cardioprotective properties. 

- The extent to which ingestion of various nitrate-rich vegetables increases postprandial plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations and lowers blood pressure is currently unknown.Objective: We aimed to assess the impact of ingesting different nitrate-rich vegetables on subsequent plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations and resting blood pressure in healthy normotensive individuals.Methods: With the use of a semirandomized crossover design, 11 men and 7 women [mean ± SEM age: 28 ± 1 y; mean ± SEM body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2): 23 ± 1; exercise: 1–10 h/wk] ingested 4 different beverages, each containing 800 mg (∼12.9 mmol) nitrate: sodium nitrate (NaNO3), concentrated beetroot juice, a rocket salad beverage, and a spinach beverage. 

- These findings show that nitrate-rich vegetables can be used as dietary nitrate supplements.High-intensity interval training improves spatial memory in ratsUniversity of Tsukuba (Japan), May 17, 2021Researchers at the University of Tsukuba have found that, despite only covering about one-third of the distance in HIIT compared with that covered in endurance training, similar improvements in exercise capacity and brain function were observed for both forms of exercise. 

- "We investigated how rats' muscles and brains—specifically, the region of the brain involved in spatial learning called the hippocampus—adapted to these types of exercise, and how the rats consequently learned and remembered navigating mazes," explains Professor Hideaki Soya, the principal investigator.In the experiment, rats were assigned to one of three groups—resting, endurance running, or alternating intervals (short sprints and rest)—during training sessions on treadmills five days/week for four weeks.Both endurance running and HIIT resulted in weight loss, greater muscle mass, and the ability to exercise longer compared with controls; however, increased cellular aerobic capacity was found in the soleus (a muscle with predominantly slow-twitch fibers that makes it functionally well suited to endurance) and in the plantaris (a muscle with predominantly fast-twitch fibers for meeting high-energy functional demands) in the endurance-running and HIIT groups, respectively.Rats in both groups demonstrated better memory of spatial learning trials in searching for an escape platform in a water maze. 

- In the hippocampus, increased cell development—neurogenesis—was also observed for both forms of exercise; however, levels of a signaling protein that promotes neurogenesis (BDNF) were increased by HIIT but not by endurance running, whereas the levels of its receptor (TrkB) were increased by both.Given that BDNF expression is known to be affected by exercise, why didn't endurance running increase BDNF expression? 

- The answer may lie in the mediating role of stress on BDNF expression; exercise is a type of stress. 

- While stress indicators in both exercise groups were found to be similar, this line of enquiry may lead to future studies:"In this study, we showed that an HIIT exercise regimen with a low exercise volume nevertheless improves spatial memory, and we demonstrated that these improvements are supported by changes in neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus. 

- "Thus, it seems that the benefits yielded by exercise may actually depend on optimization, that is, a trade-off between exercise time and intensity. 

- "A future where exercise regimens can be tailored to improve both physical and cognitive features may be on the horizon.Hygiene rules are also effective against new coronavirus variantsRuhr-University Bochum (Germany), May 21, 2021The researchers found that the variants have a similar surface stability as the wild type virus under laboratory conditions, but can be effectively eliminated by disinfection and thorough hand washing, heat or alcohol treatment. 

- They report their results in the Journal of Infectious Diseases from 16 May 2021.For this study, the team from the Department for Molecular and Medical Virology and the Chair of Materials Discovery and Interfaces at Ruhr-Universität Bochum (RUB) cooperated with the European Virus Bioinformatics Center Jena, the University Hospital Duisburg-Essen and Paracelsus Medical University Nuremberg.The fact that viruses change genetically over time is well known. 

- The British and South African variants have accumulated several mutations which result in an increased transmission and, in some cases, lead to more severe courses of disease. 

- "The surface stability did not differ between the virus variants," points out Eike Steinmann from the Department for Molecular and Medical Virology at RUB. 

- In conclusion, the team did not detect any differences between the different mutants in terms of their sensitivity to different hygiene measures.Pink drinks can help you run faster and further, study findsUniversity of Westminster, May 12, 2021A new study led by the Centre for Nutraceuticals in the University of Westminster shows that pink drinks can help to make you run faster and further compared to clear drinks.The researchers found that a pink drink can increase exercise performance by 4.4 per cent and can also increase a 'feel good' effect which can make exercise seem easier.The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, is the first investigation to assess the effect of drink colour on exercise performance and provides the potential to open a new avenue of future research in the field of sports drinks and exercise.During the study participants were asked to run on a treadmill for 30 minutes at a self-selected speed ensuring their rate of exertion remained consistent. 

- Throughout the exercise they rinsed their mouths with either a pink artificially sweetened drink that was low in calories or a clear drink which was also artificially sweetened and low in calories.Both drinks were exactly the same and only differed in appearance - the researchers added food dye to the pink drink to change the colour.The researchers chose pink as it is associated with perceived sweetness and therefore increases expectations of sugar and carbohydrate intake.Previous studies have also shown that rinsing the mouth with carbohydrates can improve exercise performance by reducing the perceived intensity of the exercise, so the researchers wanted to assess whether rinsing with a pink drink that had no carbohydrate stimulus could elicit similar benefits through a potential placebo effect.The results show that the participants ran an average 212 metres further with the pink drink while their mean speed during the exercise test also increased by 4.4 per cent. 

- "The findings from our study combine the art of gastronomy with performance nutrition, as adding a pink colourant to an artificially sweetened solution not only enhanced the perception of sweetness, but also enhanced feelings of pleasure, self-selected running speed and distance covered during a run." 

- Diet [protein intake] and exercise are the main protein balance regulators, favoring synthesis over breakdown,” said Hamilton Roschel, last author of the published study. 

- Roschel is a University of São Paulo professor affiliated with both USP’s Sports and Physical Education School (EEEE) and Medical School (FM). 

- He also heads the Applied Physiology and Nutrition Research Group jointly run by EEEE-USP and FM-USP.Protein sources are characterized primarily on the basis of essential amino acids, especially leukin, which plays a key role in anabolic stimulation of skeletal muscles. 

- For this to be the case, however, it requires appropriate nutritional counseling and education regarding people’s choices in restricting their intake to plant-based sources.”Another point noted by Roschel is that the subjects were healthy young adults, and the results might be different for older people or subjects with health problems. 

- “Aging entails a phenomenon known as anabolic resistance, meaning a suboptimal anabolic response to the stimuli provided by diet and exercise compared with young people. 

- This is the conclusion reached by psychologists at Ural Federal University who studied the effect of exercise on functions associated with voluntary regulation and control in 16 children with ADHD aged six to seven years. 

- We used a special breathing exercise based on the development of diaphragmatic rhythmic deep breathing - belly breathing. 

- "Exercise has an immediate effect that appears immediately, but there is also a delayed effect. 

- We found that exercise has a positive effect on regulation and control functions in children with ADHD and one year after the end of the exercise. 

- This will also take into account factors such as gender, age, severity of the disease, concomitant problems in children (speech, regulatory, etc. 

- ).Study findings suggest vitamin D deficiency may be associated with reduced arterial elasticityGuizhou Medical University (China), May 17, 2021According to news reporting out of Guizhou, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “There is evidence that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH) D] levels may be associated with cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. 

- This study aimed to investigate the relationship between 25-(OH) D levels and blood pressure (BP), blood lipids, and arterial elasticity in middle-aged and elderly cadres in China.In this retrospective study, we included 401 civil servants and cadres aged >42 years who underwent medical examinations at Guiyang Municipal First People’s Hospital, China in 2018.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Guizhou Medical University, “The participants were assigned to deficiency ( 20 ng/mL), insufficiency (20-30 ng/mL), and sufficiency ( 30 ng/mL) groups according to 25-(OH) D levels in their blood.

- 'RICE treatment' is a common approach for skeletal muscle injuries, regardless of the extent of the injury. 

- The study was selected for presentation at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) 2021. 

- It adds to the story that changes in the gut microbiome can affect large aspects of our health. 

- Future randomized clinical trials could help identify the mechanisms related to the reduction in respiratory symptoms and explore the possible impact of probiotics on the immune system, Dr. Mullish said.Fruit discovery could provide new treatments for obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseaseUniversity of Warwick (UK), May 11, 2021A combination of two compounds found in red grapes and oranges could be used to improve the health of people with diabetes, and reduce cases of obesity and heart disease. 

- The find has been made by University of Warwick researchers who now hope that their discovery will be developed to provide a treatment for patients.Professor Thornalley who led research said: "This is an incredibly exciting development and could have a massive impact on our ability to treat these diseases. 

- As well as helping to treat diabetes and heart disease it could defuse the obesity time bomb. 

- The project was a collaboration between the University of Warwick and University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) NHS Trust.A team led by Paul Thornalley, Professor in Systems Biology at Warwick Medical School, studied two compounds found in fruits but not usually found together. 

- Blocking MG improved health in overweight and obese people and will likely help patients with diabetes and high risk of cardiovascular disease too. 

- It has already been proven experimentally that blocking MG improves health impairment in obesity and type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Although the same compounds are found naturally in some fruits, the amounts and type required for health improvement cannot be obtained from increased fruit consumption. 

- Pharmaceutical doses for patients with obesity, diabetes and high risk of heart disease could be given to patients in capsule form.Professor Thornalley increased Glo1 expression in cell culture. 

- Changes to their sugar levels were assessed by blood samples, artery health measured by artery wall flexibility and other assessments by analysis of blood markers.The team found that the highly overweight subjects who had BMIs of over 27.5 with treatment displayed increased Glo1 activity, decreased glucose levels, improved working of insulin, improved artery function and decreased blood vessel inflammation. 

- There was no effect of placebo.Professor Thornalley said: "Obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease are at epidemic levels in Westernised countries. 

- Glo1 deficiency has been identified as a driver of health problems in obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 

- ""Diabetic kidney disease will be the initial target to prove effective treatment for which we are currently seeking commercial investors and partners. 

- Our new pharmaceutical is safe and expected to be an effective add-on treatment taken with current therapy. 

- "The key steps to discovery were to focus on increasing Glo1 and then to combine tRES and HESP together in the formulation for effective treatment. 

- "Professor Martin O Weickert, Consultant in Diabetes and Endocrinology at UHCW NHS Trust, and co-applicant for the grant, said: "We were really excited to participate in this study with Warwick Medical School, as taking part in world-leading research makes a real difference to our patients both now and in the future. 

- Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the treatment effect by type of admission, route of administration, dose of supplemented vitamin D, and the degree of vitamin D deficiency. 

- The findings, published in Cell Host & Microbe, provide novel insights into pathways linking obesity and disease-driving gut inflammation, and have implications for developing targets to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in patients.Using data from more than 900 patients, the researchers found that elevated body mass index is associated with abnormal Paneth cells among patients with Crohn's disease and non-IBD patients.Paneth cells are a type of anti-inflammatory immune cell found in the intestines that helps to protect against microbial imbalances and infectious pathogens. 

- Dr. Stappenbeck and others have previously linked Paneth cell dysfunction to gut changes indicative of IBD in preclinical models and a subset of Crohn's disease patients from multiple cohorts around the world. 

- In previous research, stimulating FXR has shown to help treat other diseases, including fatty liver disease, so we are hopeful that with additional research we can interrogate how the combination of elevated FXR and IFN signals can be targeted to help treat diet-induced gut infections and chronic inflammation."Dr. 

- But some studies do indicate that even just six sessions of interval trainingcan lead to increases in maximal oxygen uptake (V02 max) – a measure of overall fitness — and improve how efficiently our body is able to fuel itself using the sugar stored in our cells during exercise.For strength training, some gains in muscle force can be shown in as little as two weeks, but changes in muscle size won’t be seen until around 8-12 weeks.Cardiovascular fitnessWhen we stop training, how quickly we lose fitness also depends on many factors – including the type of fitness we’re talking about (such as strength or cardiovascular fitness).As an example, let’s look at a marathon runner, who is in peak athletic fitness and can run a marathon in two hours and 30 minutes. 

- So when we’re no longer working our muscles hard, the muscles become “lazy”, leading the number of our muscle fibres to decrease, and fewer muscles being recruited during an activity – making us less able to lift the heavy loads we used to.The number of muscle fibres used during exercise decreases by around 13% after just two weeks of no training – though this appears not to be accompanied by a decline in muscular force. 

- But the fitter you are, the slower you’ll lose your gains.Non-drug therapies as good as or better than drugs for treating depression in people with dementiaSt Michael’s Hospital, University of Toronto, University of Calgary May 17, 2021Doctors should consider more "social" prescribing of non-drug approaches for depression and loneliness, say researchersNon-drug therapies, such as exercise, appear to be as, or more, effective than drugs for reducing symptoms of depression in people with dementia, suggests research published online in The BMJ.The findings suggest that people with dementia will derive a clinically meaningful benefit from non-drug interventions, and the researchers say doctors should consider more "social" prescribing of non-drug approaches to treat symptoms of depression and loneliness.Fifty million people worldwide have a diagnosis of dementia. 

- About 16% of these people also have a diagnosed major depressive disorder, and 32% will experience symptoms of depression without a formal diagnosis.Previous trials have shown that non-drug approaches, such as exercise, alleviate symptoms of depression in people with dementia, but it's not clear how effective they are compared with drugs to reduce symptoms of depression.To address this uncertainty, researchers analysed the results of existing trials to compare the effectiveness of drug and non-drug interventions with usual care or any other intervention targeting symptoms of depression in people with dementia.After screening 22,138 records, they focused on and reviewed 256 studies involving 28,483 people with dementia, with or without a diagnosed major depressive disorder.Drug approaches alone were no more effective than usual care, but they found 10 interventions associated with a greater reduction in symptoms of depression compared with usual care.These were cognitive stimulation, exercise, reminiscence therapy (a treatment to help people with dementia remember events, people and places from their lives), cognitive stimulation with a cholinesterase inhibitor (a drug used to treat dementia), massage and touch therapy, multidisciplinary care, psychotherapy combined with reminiscence therapy and environmental modification, occupational therapy, exercise combined with social interaction and cognitive stimulation, and animal therapy.Three interventions -- massage and touch therapy, cognitive stimulation with a cholinesterase inhibitor, and cognitive stimulation combined with exercise and social interaction -- were found to be more effective than some drugs.The authors acknowledge some study limitations, such as being unable to explore severity of depression symptoms or effects on different types of dementia. 

- Nor did they look at the potential costs or harms of implementing drug and non-drug interventions.However, notable strengths included the large number of articles reviewed and use of a recognised clinical scale for capturing symptoms of depression.As such, they say in this systematic review, "non-drug approaches were associated with a meaningful reduction in symptoms of depression in people with dementia and without a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder.And they add that everyone -- patients, caregivers, clinicians and policy makers -- have a role in translating these findings into practiceOmega-3 lowers childhood aggression in short term, Penn research showsUniversity of Pennsylvania, May 13, 2021Incorporating omega-3, vitamins and mineral supplements into the diets of children with extreme aggression can reduce this problem behavior in the short term, especially its more impulsive, emotional form, according to University of Pennsylvania researchers who published their findings in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.Adrian Raine, the Richard Perry University Professor of Criminology, Psychology and Psychiatry, has spent his career looking at how the brain's biological functioning affects antisocial behavior.

- "Lockdown led to positive lifestyle changes in older peopleUniversity of Stirling (Scotland), May 17, 2021The COVID-19 lockdown was a catalyst for many older people to embrace technology, reconnect with friends and build new relationships with neighbours, according to University of Stirling research.Understanding the coping mechanisms adopted by some over 60s during the pandemic will play a key role in developing interventions to help tackle loneliness, isolation and wellbeing in the future.The study, led by the Faculty of Health Sciences and Sport, surveyed 1,429 participants - 84 percent (1,198) of whom were over 60 - and found many had adapted to video conferencing technology to increase online contact with existing social networks, while others reconnected with previous networks. 

- Participants reported that lockdown had led them to engage with neighbours and other members of their communities for the first time, while several said social distancing had brought an additional meaning to life, by highlighting what was important to them.Published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, the paper comes six months after the study - funded under the Scottish Government Chief Scientist Office's Rapid Research in COVID-19 programme - reported in its preliminary findings that social distancing had increased feelings of loneliness in older people.Professor of Behavioural Medicine, Anna Whittaker, who led the study, said: "Our research found that the COVID-19 lockdown triggered feelings of loneliness in older people - with many experiencing less social contact and support. 

- However, the study also highlighted positive outcomes, for example, lockdown encouraged some older people to embrace and engage with technology - such as Zoom, Whatsapp or FaceTime - to stay in touch with loved-ones or participate in exercise classes or religious groups. 

- New activities included bingo and quiz nights, while other activities moved online - such as bridge nights, book clubs, choir rehearsals, and dance and exercise classes.The role of community - particularly neighbours - was mentioned by more than 300 participants and some reported the common experience of getting to know previously unknown neighbours and increase interaction with others in the community at local shops or parks. 

- A pleasant Scottish summer also supported such interactions, several said.At least 100 people said social interactions were linked to their physical activities - such as time spent outdoors while walking for exercise, walking the dogs or active commuting.Professor Whittaker added: "Our research underlines the importance of addressing loneliness and social support in older adults - but particularly during situations where risk of isolation is high. 

- "Signs of Vitamin B12 DeficiencyWorld Health Net,  May 1, 2021Modern nutritional research offers much more information about which nutrients are required for optimal health than in years past. 

- The general opinion of most health care providers has been that patients should eat a balanced diet in order to make sure their nutritional needs are being met. 

- Those who have a deficiency of vitamin B12 may be experiencing some serious health problems that they are not even aware of.Food Sources of Vitamin B12Food products that come from animals are the only sources of the vitamin, so someone who follows a vegetarian or vegan diet would most likely need to supplement B12. 

- Health Problems Caused by a Vitamin B12 DeficiencySome of these health issues are easily mistaken as symptoms of other diseases, such as diabetes. 

- Poultry is relatively low in fat and cholesterol, so it is safer for those who are at risk for heart disease. 

- Recently she had an important paper published in this month's issue of the journal Science, Public Health Policy and the Law, which  analyzed the data of Covid-19 vaccine injuries and deaths reported in the Centers for Disease Control's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System  or VAERS. 

- After receiving a bachelor’s degree from Baylor University, Dr. McCullough completed his medical degree as an Alpha Omega Alpha graduate from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. 

- He went on to complete his internal medicine residency at the University of Washington in Seattle, cardiology fellowship including service as Chief Fellow at William Beaumont Hospital, and master’s degree in public health at the University of Michigan. 

- Dr. McCullough is a consultant cardiologist and Vice Chief of Medicine at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, TX. 

- He is a Principal Faculty in internal medicine for the Texas A & M University Health Sciences Center. 

- Dr. McCullough is an internationally recognized authority on the role of chronic kidney disease as a cardiovascular risk state with > 1000 publications and > 500 citations in the National Library of Medicine. 

- His works include the “Interface between Renal Disease and Cardiovascular Illness” in Braunwald’s Heart Disease Textbook. 

- His works have appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet and other top-tier journals worldwide. 

- Dr. McCullough has made presentations on the advancement of medicine across the world and has been an invited lecturer at the New York Academy of Sciences, the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency, and the U.S. Congressional Oversight Panel. 

- Moreover the vaccines’ serious adverse effects are being downplayed by health officials and the media. 

- And a group of medical institutions including the University of Greifswald School of Medicine, and the Medical University of Vienna are proposing a new medical condition, “vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia,” now be associated with the AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson vaccines.A recent paper warns about the dangers of vaccine-induced prion disease. 

- Whether or not health officials at the CDC or FDA thoroughly deliberated on the many warnings or simply ignored them is open to debate. 

- Another is the president of Meharry Medical College where coronavirus clinical trials were conducted. 

- Prof. Carl Elliott, a medical ethicist at the University of Minnesota, summarized the problem of corporate bias now plaguing the FDA. 

- The journal’s review of compensation records uncovered “pay after” schemes for the approval of 28 psychopharmacologic, arthritis, cardiac and renal drugs.” The investigation also uncovered:“Of the more than $24 million in personal payments or research support from industry to the 16 top-earning advisers—who received more than $300,000 each—93% came from the makers of drugs those advisers previously reviewed or from competitors.”Probing still deeper, the Pacific Legal Foundation released an analytical review of 2,952 rules issued by the Department of Health and Human Services over a 17-year period. 

- However, this is a myth perpetuated not only by drug makers but also by our own federal health agencies.As we have reported on many occasions, iatrogenic deaths, deaths caused by medical error and prescribed medications is now the third leading cause of mortality in the US. 

- The Institute of Medicine has warned about “the nation’s epidemic of medical errors.” A large percent of these errors are related to adverse drug events (ADEs). 

- Furburg and his colleagues wrote, “We see eight major problems with the current system of assessment and assurance of drug safety at the FDA.” A fundamental problem is the FDA’s initial review for drug approval that often fails to detect serious ADRs: “A study by the US General Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that 51% of all approved drugs had at least one serious ADR that was not recognized during the approval process.”A 2003 investigation published in The Independent in the UK reported “under pressure from the pharmaceutical industry, the FDA routinely conceals information it considers commercially sensitive, leaving medical specialists unable to assess the true risks [of approved drugs].” One case involved a very popular over-the-counter drug, the painkiller ibuprofen. 

- The FDA, which was budgeted for $5.9 billion in FY 2019, is ruled and governed by a small group of political scientists who have abdicated their ethical responsibilities as physicians and medical professionals. 

- The pharmaceutical industry has corrupted the practice of medicine through its influence over what drugs are developed, how they are tested, and how medical knowledge is created. 

- Seife and his team undertook the task to investigate and analyze the extent to which the FDA covers up evidence of fraud and corruption in medical drug trials. 

- One of Seife’s primary questions was the frequency that FDA officials discover flagrant and intentional misconduct and subsequently decide to bury the evidence and prevent it from becoming public to the medical community. 

- For one trial alone, where FDA inspectors found significant fraud and misconduct, 78 different medical publications printed articles based upon that single study. 

- At the Mexican site, there was "systematic discarding of medical records." 

- Only two of these remain on the market today—Accutane and Arava, a drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis that I and a co-worker believe causes an unacceptably high risk of acute liver failure and death.”The Los Angeles Times reported that witnesses told the Senate panel that Merck and the FDA knowingly had data well before the approval and licensure of Merck’s Vioxx painkiller that proved the drug’s serious cardiovascular health risks. 

- Nevertheless, the evidence clearly shows that our government health officials would rather support pharmaceutical profiteering than the health and safety and American citizens. 

- Shortly after the pandemic was formally announced, and with no promising treatment in sight, the FDA recommended HCQ but then reversed its decision in June after Anthony Fauci publicly announced the coming arrival of Gilead’s novel drug remdesivir. 

- “The very next day,” reported the Alliance for Natural Health, “Merck announced positive results from a clinical trial on a new drug called molnupiravir in eliminating the virus in infected patients.”  Again, the FDA had been working in concert with the pharmaceutical industry to advance expensive experimental drugs rather than cheaper and proven drugs with decades of research to back their safety records.In addition, the FDA has waged a war against alternative medical systems for many decades, including natural supplements. 

- One of the key executors of the agency’s revitalized assault against supplements and the natural health industry was Trump’s appointment of Scott Gottlieb as FDA Commissioner. 

- Following his two years at the FDA’s helm, Gottlieb quit and joined Pfizer’s Board of Directors.The FDA’s argument is rather straightforward, albeit dubious; since supplements, including Vitamin C and D, Omega-3 fatty acids, and even minerals such as magnesium and zinc have not been formally submitted to the FDA for evaluation to be registered as “approved drugs,” it is against the law to make any health claims about their health benefits. 

- In the meantime, supplement manufacturers are prohibited from stating the vitamin’s benefit to the public thereby contributing to a gross disservice.“Clearly these are the actions of an agency looking to restrict the supplement market,” according to the Alliance for Natural Health, “and remove as many products as possible in as many ways as possible.”  One reason is that if a vitamin or supplement were to go through the FDA licensure treadmill, the agency could potentially require a supplement’s access by prescription only. 

- A recent Harvard University and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation survey reported that public trust in America’s health care system has rapidly fallen during the pandemic to 34 percent. 

- Only 37 percent stated they had much trust in the FDA.This trend may very likely continue as a growing number of physicians and medical experts are sounding alarms over the flagrant incompetence of our federal officials leading the national efforts against Covid-19 and the approval vaccines with highly questionable safety records and expensive novel drugs that fail to warrant use. 

- Worldwide, tens of thousands of otherwise orthodox medical professionals are charging Anthony Fauci, the CDC, FDA and the World Health Organization with gross mishandling of the pandemic. 

- Lawsuits are underway against national health ministries around the world for deceiving their populations with fraudulent PCR testing, fake mortality rates and unwarranted public health policies that have produced extreme harm and suffering. 

- For decades Congressional committees have warned the agency about it’s ignoring the public health of Americans and its revolving door policies with drug makers. 

- Another  solution could be the creation of separate and independent National Drug Safety Board without ties to private industry or overlapping conflicts of interest with the existing health agencies in dire need of reform. 

- However that tipping point has not been reached to expect any of our politicians to switch sides and for once serve the public’s health interests

- Recent studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease are deficient in these 'good' bacteria, so our findings may help explain that connection and open up an area of future study," he added.All neurodegenerative diseases can be traced to problems with the way proteins are handled in the body. 

- "You could compare the pick to an obstacle course: just as a person with a neurodegenerative disease will have trouble getting across, the same is true with these worms, just at a much smaller scale," Czyz added.Fun fact: Human eyebrow hairs or eyelashes make for very good picks. 

- However, it will take many more years of research before we can understand what, if any, connection there is between antibiotic resistance and neurodegenerative diseases," Czyz said.Meditative practice and spiritual wellbeing may preserve cognitive function in agingAlzheimer's Research and Prevention Foundation &Thomas Jefferson University, May 11, 2021It is projected that up to 152 million people worldwide will be living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by 2050. 

- A new review in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, published by IOS Press, examines research that finds spiritual fitness, a new concept in medicine that centers on psychological and spiritual wellbeing, and Kirtan Kriya, a simple 12-minute meditative practice, may reduce multiple risk factors for AD. 

- "The key point of this review is that making a commitment to a brain longevity lifestyle, including spiritual fitness, is a critically important way for aging Alzheimer's disease free," explain authors Dharma Singh Khalsa, MD, Alzheimer's Research and Prevention Foundation, Tucson, AZ, USA, and Andrew B. Newberg, MD, Department of Integrative Medicine and Nutritional Sciences, Department of Radiology, Marcus Institute of Integrative Health, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA. 

- For example, psychological wellbeing may reduce inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and disability. 

- Research in healthy individuals, caregivers, and those with cognitive decline found that the practice improves cognition, slows memory loss, and improves mood.The overall relationship between spiritual fitness and a person's complete physical and mental health is a topic of investigation in the emerging field of study called neurotheology. 

- "Type 2 Diabetes: Sitting can Cause Problems with Blood Sugar Levels, So Get Up and MoveGlasgow Caledonian University, May 11, 2021Many people spend large portions of their day sitting, which can cause a range of health problems. 

- But many may not realise that sitting too much can also worsen certain health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes. 

- Controlling blood sugar levels is important for avoiding the risk of serious health problems.Lifestyle changes, such as adjusting diet and physical activity, and diabetes medications, such as metformin or gliptin, are used to lower blood sugar levels. 

- Other research has shown that keeping bouts of sitting shorter than 15 minutes is better for blood sugar levels.The reason walking – and other types of exercise – are so good for regulating blood sugar is because they make the body’s muscles work. 

- But adding extra movement into their day will not only improve blood sugar control, it may also improve other aspects of health – including heart health and bone density.Grapeseed compound has senolytic activityChinese Academy of Sciences, May 10, 2021According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from biorxiv.org:“Aging causes functional decline of multiple organs and increases the risk of age-related pathologies.“In advanced lives, accumulation of senescent cells, which develop the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), promotes chronic inflammation and causes diverse conditions.“Here we report the frontline outcome of screening a natural product library with human primary stromal cells as an experimental model. 

- PCC1 depletes senescent cells in treatment-damaged tumor microenvironment (TME) and enhances therapeutic efficacy when combined with chemotherapy in preclinical assays. 

- Intermittent administration of PCC1 to both senescent cell-implanted mice and naturally aged animals alleviated physical dysfunction and prolonged post-treatment survival, thus providing substantial benefits in late life stage. 

- This protective layer acts as a defense against invaders—including bacteria, viruses, environmental toxins, pollutants and allergens.If the skin and mucosal barriers are damaged or leaky, foreign agents such as bacteria can enter into the tissue and cause local, often chronic inflammation with both direct and indirect consequences.“The epithelial barrier hypothesis proposes that damages to the epithelial barrier are responsible for up to two billion chronic, non-infectious diseases,” says Cezmi Akdis, director of the Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research (SIAF), which is associated with the University of Zurich.In the past 20 years, researchers at the SIAF alone have published more than 60 articles on how various substances damage the epithelial cells of a number of organs.The epithelial barrier hypothesis provides an explanation as to why allergies and autoimmune diseases have been increasing for decades—they are linked to industrialization, urbanization, and westernized lifestyle.Today many people are exposed to a wide range of toxins, such as ozone, nanoparticles, microplastics, household cleaning agents, pesticides, enzymes, emulsifiers, fine dust, exhaust fumes, cigarette smoke, and countless chemicals in the air, food, and water.“Next to global warming and viral pandemics such as COVID-19, these harmful substances represent one of the greatest threats to humankind,” Akdis says.Local epithelial damage to the skin and mucosal barriers lead to allergic conditions, inflammatory bowel disorders, and celiac disease. 

- But disruptions to the epithelial barrier can also be linked to many other diseases that are characterized by changes in the microbiome.Either the immune system erroneously attacks “good” bacteria in healthy bodies or it targets pathogenic—i.e., “bad”—invaders.In the gut, leaky epithelial barriers and microbial imbalance contribute to the onset or development of chronic autoimmune and metabolic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or ankylosing spondylitis.Moreover, defective epithelial barriers have also been linked to neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorders, and chronic depression, which may be triggered or aggravated by distant inflammatory responses and changes in the gut’s microbiome.“There is a great need to continue research into the epithelial barrier to advance our understanding of molecular mechanisms and develop new approaches for prevention, early intervention and therapy,” says Akdis.Novel therapeutic approaches could focus on strengthening tissue-specific barriers, blocking bacteria or avoiding colonization by pathogens. 

- Last but not least, the focus must also be on avoiding and reducing exposure to harmful substances and developing fewer toxic products.The paper appears in Nature Reviews ImmunologyStudy supports heart health benefits of mushroom powdersTufts University, May 11, 2021Adding Portobello or shiitake powder to a high-fat diet may protect arteries from the detrimental effects of a high fat diet, according to findings presented at the recent Experimental Biology event.Scientists from Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research on Aging at Tufts University report that supplementing the diets of lab mice with the mushroom powders had lower body weight gains, compared to animals fed an unsupplemented high-fat diet.“Despite the low body weight gains, EchoMRI analysis of body composition revealed that the overall lean mass was not affected as significantly as fat mass, indicating a plausible positive effect of mushrooms on fat metabolism and lipid profiles,” wrote the researchers in their abstract, published in the FASEB Journal .MushroomsConsumer interest in mushrooms and their potential health benefits has been growing in recent years, with demand for Reishi, Chaga, Shiitake, Maitake, and the rest has never been higher and the global market was pegged at $18 billion in 2014 (up from $6 billion in 1999).SPINS data shows surging sales of products with various types of mushrooms as primary ingredients across the natural, specialty and conventional multi-outlet retail channels. 

- It is naturally present in small amounts in food sources like mushrooms, some varieties of black and red beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cereals.The human body has a dedicated transporter for the molecule, which is a potent antioxidant.Lab mice were divided into one of five groups: A low-fat control group (4% fat); a high fat control group (8% fat); a high-fat diet supplemented with Portobello mushroom powder; a high fat diet supplemented with shiitake mushroom powder; or a “control mixture”, which matched to the average nutrient levels of the mushroom powders.After 16 weeks of feeding, the results showed that animals from both mushroom groups had reduced body weight gains, compared to the other dietary groups, with the weight gain lower in the shiitake group compared to the Portobello group.Additional analyses showed that only mice fed the shiitake powder had significantly fewer aortic lesions compared to the high fat control mice and the control mixture.“These results further support the potential role of high levels of bioactive compounds such as ergothioneine, a strong antioxidant in [shiitake mushroom], on suppression of dietary fat induced atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease of arteries,” wrote the researchers.The study was funded by the USDA and the Mushroom Council.MIT Study Suggests Six Foot Social Distancing, Limited Occupancy Rules Are Completely PointlessAfter over a year, scientists have determined that social distancing and limited occupancy rules may be totally uselessNational File, April 26, 2021A new study conducted by MIT scientists and released this week reveals that the six foot social distancing and limited occupancy guidelines made law in most of the civilized world have done little to slow the spread of COVID-19, and suggests the only way to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to limit exposure to highly populated areas and areas where people are physically exerting themselves, such as gyms, or areas where people are singing or speaking, such as churches.The study reveals that the social distancing guidelines employed throughout much of the world for over a year have done nothing to limit the spread of COVID-19, suggesting that the adaption of the guidelines did not stop the spread of the of the China-originated virus, and it can only be slowed with the employment of severe lockdowns. 

- ‘In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients.’ Prion-based diseases are, according to the CDC, a form of neurodegenerative diseases, meaning that the Pfizer vaccine is potentially likely to cause long term damage and negative health effects with regards to the brain.”
Study presents evidence supporting the use of curcumin as alternative treatment for kidney fibrosisZhejiang University (China), May 7, 2021In a recent study, Chinese researchers explored the anti-fibrotic effects of curcumin, the active component of turmeric. 

- Meanwhile, the PI3K/Akt pathway is one of the major cell signaling pathways that regulate fibrosis.The researchers reported their findings in an article published in the journal Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin.Curcumin is an effective alternative treatment for renal fibrosisAccording to several animal studies, curcumin can protect the kidneys by preventing the development of renal fibrosis. 

- In addition, the researchers noted that curcumin reduced Akt, mTOR and P70S6K phosphorylation, which effectively suppressed the activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway in HKCs.Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that curcumin is an effective alternative treatment for renal fibrosis because it can promote HKC proliferation and stop EMT by inhibiting the activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway activity.Research reveals new approach to understanding our wellbeingSwansea University, May 12, 2021The ability to connect and feel a sense of belonging are basic human needs but new Swansea University research has examined how these are determined by more than just our personal relationships.Research led by psychologist Professor Andrew Kemp, of the College of Human and Health Sciences, highlights the importance of taking a wider approach to wellbeing and how it can be influenced by issues such as inequality and anthropogenic climate change.Professor Kemp worked with Ph.D. student Jess Mead and consultant clinical psychologist Dr. Zoe Fisher, of the University's Health and Wellbeing Academy, on the study which presents a transdisciplinary framework to help understand and improve wellbeing.Professor Kemp said: "We define wellbeing as positive psychological experience, promoted by connections to self, community and environment, supported by healthy vagal function, all of which are impacted by socio-contextual factors that lie beyond the control of the individual. 

- "The research reveals the advantages to health and wellbeing derived from connecting to oneself, others and nature and emphasizes a need for focused efforts to tackle major societal issues that affect our capacity for connection.He added: "The poorest are disproportionally impacted by major societal challenges including increasing burden of chronic disease, societal loneliness and anthropogenic climate change. 

- "Taking a transdisciplinary approach to the topic of wellbeing is something currently reflected across Swansea University, particularly since the opening of the Morgan Advanced Studies Institute (MASI) which is dedicated to supporting transformative interdisciplinary research.Taurine’s neuroprotective effect on cells under oxidative stressUniversity of Vale do Paraiba (Brazil), May 10, 2021According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from biorxiv.org:“Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a type of dementia that affects millions of people.

- Different medications have been used in prevention of migraine headache.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, “In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of magnesium oxide in comparison with valproate sodium in preventing migraine headache attacks. 

- This is a single-center, randomized, controlled, crossover trial which is double-blind, 24-week, 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment. 

- The mean number of migraine attacks and days per month was 1.72 +/- 1.18 and 2.09 +/- 1.70, with a mean duration of 15.50 +/- 21.80 h in magnesium group and 1.27 +/- 1.27 and 2.22 +/- 1.96, with a mean duration 13.38 +/- 14.10 in valproate group.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “This study has shown that 500 mg magnesium oxide appears to be effective in migraine prophylaxis similar to valproate sodium without significant adverse effect.”This research has been peer-reviewedVitamin D and calcium from food is associated with lower risk of early menopauseUniversity of Massachusetts, May 10, 2021A new study led by epidemiologists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's School of Public Health and Health Sciences suggests that high intake of dietary vitamin D and calcium may be modestly associated with lower risk of early menopause, the cessation of ovarian function before age 45. 

- Early menopause affects about 10 percent of women and is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and early cognitive decline.Epidemiology doctoral candidate Alexandra Purdue-Smithe and her advisor Elizabeth Bertone-Johnson, with colleagues at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, and Harvard Medical School, evaluated how vitamin D and calcium intake is associated with incidence of early menopause in the prospective Nurses' Health Study II. 

- Details of the study, supported by the National Institutes of Health, appear in the current early online edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Purdue-Smithe says, "Laboratory evidence relating vitamin D to some of the hormonal mechanisms involved in ovarian aging provided the foundation for our hypothesis. 

- "Because higher intake of vitamin D and calcium from foods may simply act as a marker for better nutrition and overall health, Purdue-Smithe says, the researchers took into account other factors such as intake of vegetable protein and alcohol, as well as body mass index and smoking.

- "The study, published in the medical journal Preventive Medicine, finds that people who have consistently high levels of physical activity have significantly longer telomeres than those who have sedentary lifestyles, as well as those who are moderately active.Telomeres are the protein endcaps of our chromosomes. 

- Therefore, the older we get, the shorter our telomeres.Exercise science professor Larry Tucker found adults with high physical activity levels have telomeres with a biological aging advantage of nine years over those who are sedentary, and a seven-year advantage compared to those who are moderately active. 

- "If you want to see a real difference in slowing your biological aging, it appears that a little exercise won't cut it," Tucker said. 

- "Tucker analyzed data from 5,823 adults who participated in the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, one of the few indexes that includes telomere length values for study subjects. 

- Surprisingly, he also found there was no significant difference in telomere length between those with low or moderate physical activity and the sedentary people.Although the exact mechanism for how exercise preserves telomeres is unknown, Tucker said it may be tied to inflammation and oxidative stress. 

- Previous studies have shown telomere length is closely related to those two factors and it is known that exercise can suppress inflammation and oxidative stress over time. 

- One small 2020 study found that 60% of people with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease experienced worsening cognition and delirium during the lockdown.But the link between isolation and cognitive decline is more than speculation.Isolation risksIsolation (being cut off from social contact) was a problem for older adults long before the pandemic began. 

- That sometimes puts health in jeopardy. 

- "In lab animals, isolation has been shown to cause brain shrinkage and the kind of brain changes you'd see in Alzheimer's disease — reduced brain cell connections and reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is important for the formation, connection, and repair of brain cells. 

- "Having access to others for emotional support or listening to you seems to have a protective brain health effect — increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and reduced risks for dementia or stroke," Dr. Salinas says.In the pandemic, you may also be experiencing high stress levels, which can affect your brain's processing skills. 

- Who Suppressed Ivermectinhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vj3xGT6izEExchange between Sen. Rand Paul and Dr. Anthony FauciVegetarians have healthier levels of disease markers than meat-eatersUniversity of Glasgow (Scotland), May 10. 

- 2021Vegetarians appear to have a healthier biomarker profile than meat-eaters, and this applies to adults of any age and weight, and is also unaffected by smoking and alcohol consumption, according to a new study in over 166,000 UK adults, being presented at this week's European Congress on Obesity (ECO), held online this year.Biomarkers can have bad and good health effects, promoting or preventing cancer, cardiovascular and age-related diseases, and other chronic conditions, and have been widely used to assess the effect of diets on health. 

- However, evidence of the metabolic benefits associated with being vegetarian is unclear.To understand whether dietary choice can make a difference to the levels of disease markers in blood and urine, researchers from the University of Glasgow did a cross-sectional study analysing data from 177,723 healthy participants (aged 37-73 years) in the UK Biobank study, who reported no major changes in diet over the last five years.Participants were categorised as either vegetarian (do not eat red meat, poultry or fish; 4,111 participants) or meat-eaters (166,516 participants) according to their self-reported diet. 

- The researchers examined the association with 19 blood and urine biomarkers related to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, liver, bone and joint health, and kidney function.Even after accounting for potentially influential factors including age, sex, education, ethnicity, obesity, smoking, and alcohol intake, the analysis found that compared to meat-eaters, vegetarians had significantly lower levels of 13 biomarkers, including: total cholesterol; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol--the so-called 'bad cholesterol; apolipoprotein A (linked to cardiovascular disease), apolipoprotein B (linked to cardiovascular disease); gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (AST)--liver function markers indicating inflammation or damage to cells; insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1; a hormone that encourages the growth and proliferation of cancer cells); urate; total protein; and creatinine (marker of worsening kidney function).However, vegetarians also had lower levels of beneficial biomarkers including high-density lipoprotein 'good' (HDL) cholesterol, and vitamin D and calcium (linked to bone and joint health). 

- These nutritional differences may help explain why vegetarians appear to have lower levels of disease biomarkers that can lead to cell damage and chronic disease. 

- They also note that were reliant on participants to report their dietary intake using food frequency questionnaires, which is not always reliable.Alzheimer's study: A Mediterranean diet might protect against memory loss and dementiaGerman Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, May 6, 2021In Alzheimer's disease, neurons in the brain die. 

- 169 of them were cognitively healthy, while 343 were identified as having a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease - due to subjective memory impairment, mild cognitive impairment that is the precursor to dementia, or first-degree relationship with patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. 

- The nutrition study was funded by the Diet-Body-Brain competence cluster of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and took place as part of the so-called DELCODE study of the DZNE, which does nationwide research on the early phase of Alzheimer's disease - that period before pronounced symptoms appear. 

- We analyzed whether the study participants regularly eat a Mediterranean diet - and whether this might have an impact on brain health ", said Prof. Michael Wagner. 

- It shrinks early and severely in Alzheimer's disease," explained Tommaso Ballarini, PhD, postdoctoral fellow in Michael Wagner's research group and lead author of the study.Continuation of nutrition study is planned"It is possible that the Mediterranean diet protects the brain from protein deposits and brain atrophy that can cause memory loss and dementia. 

- As a next step, Ballarini and Wagner now plan to re-examine the same study participants in four to five years to explore how their nutrition - Mediterranean-like or unhealthy - affects brain aging over time.Social isolation has a profound and increasingly negative impact on physical functioning in older adultsUniversity of Southern Denmark, May 11, 2021Social isolation among older adults is associated with poor health and premature mortality, but the connection between social isolation and physical functioning is poorly understood. 

- "Physical functioning is understood to influence the health of individuals. 

- Older adults who are socially integrated may be more likely to engage in physical activity, which would in turn elicit improvements in their physical functioning.Social isolation is a significant problem facing the health and well-being of individuals across the life course. 

- Individuals who are socially isolated are more likely to experience mental health problems, develop dementia, and have increased risk of premature mortality. 

- Given the worldwide trends in population aging, social isolation among older adults is likely to become an increasing burden in years to come.To examine the longitudinal associations between social isolation and physical functioning, investigators used nine waves of panel data from 2011 to 2019 from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a large US-representative sample of adults 65 or older. 

- The results showed that the older individuals are, the greater the extent to which social isolation impacts their health.A small but growing number of observational studies in the UK, Japan, and China have identified negative associations between social isolation and physical functioning in samples of older adults. 

- "Physical functioning is a well-established marker of general health and it has been previously correlated with morbidity and mortality," noted Dr. del Pozo Cruz. 

- Mandated social contact restrictions and lockdowns due to COVID-19, coupled with more severe consequences of contagion among older adults, have likely exacerbated this trend.Study findings suggest that public health interventions should turn their attention to the social environments in which older people are embedded, in particular for those at risk of isolation. 

- However, boys' mental health appears to be affected more if they suffer from obesity. 

- These conclusions are drawn by researchers at Uppsala University who monitored adolescents for six years in a questionnaire study, now published in the Journal of Public Health. 

- "One key conclusion and take-home message from our study is that bullying can affect mental illness for a long time to come, which therefore makes preventive measures against bullying in schools extremely important," Kanders says.Efficacy of magnesium oxide and sodium valproate in prevention of migraine headache: a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover studyMazandaran University of Medical Sciences (Iran), May 4, 2021According to news originating from Sari, Iran, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, “Migraine is a disabling disorder that affects the quality of life of patients. 

- Different medications have been used in prevention of migraine headache.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, “In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of magnesium oxide in comparison with valproate sodium in preventing migraine headache attacks. 

- This is a single-center, randomized, controlled, crossover trial which is double-blind, 24-week, 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment. 

- The mean number of migraine attacks and days per month was 1.72 +/- 1.18 and 2.09 +/- 1.70, with a mean duration of 15.50 +/- 21.80 h in magnesium group and 1.27 +/- 1.27 and 2.22 +/- 1.96, with a mean duration 13.38 +/- 14.10 in valproate group.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “This study has shown that 500 mg magnesium oxide appears to be effective in migraine prophylaxis similar to valproate sodium without significant adverse effect.”This research has been peer-reviewedVitamin D and calcium from food is associated with lower risk of early menopauseUniversity of Massachusetts, May 10, 2021A new study led by epidemiologists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's School of Public Health and Health Sciences suggests that high intake of dietary vitamin D and calcium may be modestly associated with lower risk of early menopause, the cessation of ovarian function before age 45. 

- Early menopause affects about 10 percent of women and is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and early cognitive decline.Epidemiology doctoral candidate Alexandra Purdue-Smithe and her advisor Elizabeth Bertone-Johnson, with colleagues at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, and Harvard Medical School, evaluated how vitamin D and calcium intake is associated with incidence of early menopause in the prospective Nurses' Health Study II. 

- Details of the study, supported by the National Institutes of Health, appear in the current early online edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Purdue-Smithe says, "Laboratory evidence relating vitamin D to some of the hormonal mechanisms involved in ovarian aging provided the foundation for our hypothesis. 

- "Because higher intake of vitamin D and calcium from foods may simply act as a marker for better nutrition and overall health, Purdue-Smithe says, the researchers took into account other factors such as intake of vegetable protein and alcohol, as well as body mass index and smoking. 

- "The nutritional and reproductive epidemiologist notes that "in addition to placing women at higher risk of adverse future health outcomes, early menopause is also problematic as women are increasingly delaying childbearing into their later reproductive years. 

- "Because associations were stronger for vitamin D and calcium from dairy sources than from non-dairy food sources in the study, and Purdue-Smithe plans further analyses investigating individual dairy foods and other components of dairy and how they may be associated with early menopause.High levels of exercise linked to 9 years of less aging at the cellular levelBrigham Young University, May 10, 2021\Despite their best efforts, no scientist has ever come close to stopping humans from aging.

Why are Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin Being Officially SuppressedRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, May 10, 2021Had the FDA and Anthony Fauci’s National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease (NIAID) started approving existing clinically-proven and inexpensive drugs for treating malaria, parasites and other pathogens at the start of the pandemic, millions of people would have been saved from experiencing serious infections or dying from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 

- Why federal health officials never followed this strategy is a question the mainstream media refuses to ask.Another question that the medical establishment, let alone our compliant media, is why have they failed to ask whether there are reliable studies in the peer-reviewed literature and testimonies from thousands of day-to-day clinical physicians worldwide who treat Covid-19 patients with these drugs, in particular hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Ivermectin. 

- However, in the US, Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, the FDA and our institutional medical leaders have categorically denied their use. 

- In fact they are quick to erect obstacles to prevent them from being prescribed.When these questions are posited as a general argument for advocating expedient measures to protect public health during this pandemic, would it not have been wise to have prioritized HCQ, Ivermectin, and other remedies with a record of curtailing Covid, such as the antibiotic azirthromicin, zinc, selenium, Vitamins C and D, and melatonin as a first line of defense? 

- But this is what Fauci and Trump permitted to happen.If this strategy of medical intervention had been followed, would it have been successful? 

- Yet those American physicians struggling to get this urgent message out to federal health officials are being marginalized and ridiculed en masse. 

- The World Health Organization recommends Ivermectin for Covid-19 so why not the US and these other nations? 

- Under oath, multiple physicians and professors at American medical schools have testified before Congress to present the scientific evidence supporting HCQ and Ivermectin. 

- These are otherwise medical professionals at the very heart of treating Covid-19 patients.Today, American journalism is in shambles. 

- Whether it is CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post, NPR or PBS, they each have unlimited resources to properly investigate the federal and institutional machinery behind the government health policies being thrust upon us. 

- Yet no mainstream journalist has found the moral compass to bring this truth to the public.In the meantime, we are allowing millions to die, and countless others to be seriously affected from a severe infection because of professional medical neglect and a healthcare system favoring the pharmaceutical industry’s frantic rush to develop expensive novel drugs and experimental vaccines. 

- Worldwide, it is not unreasonable to claim that billions of people have been treated with these drugs.Below is a breakdown of the studies conducted so far for HCQ, Ivermectin and Vitamin D specifically for combatting the SARS-CoV-2 virusHydroxychloroquine291 studies, 218 peer-reviewed have been conducted specifically for Covid-19241 have been clinical trials that involved 3,875 scientists and over 366,000 patients33 were randomize controlled trials65% improvement in 26 early treatment trials72% improvement in 11 early stage infection treatment mortality results22% improvement in 164 late stage infection treatment trials (patients in serious condition)Full list of HCQ studies and details:  https://c19hcq.comIvermectin92 studies, 52 peer-reviewed have been conducted specifically for Covid-1954 have been clinical trials that involved 442 scientists and over 17,600 patients27 were randomized controlled trials85% improvement in 14 prophylaxis trials80% improvement in 20 early stage infection treatment trials47% improvement in 20 late stage infection treatment trials74% improvement in 20 mortality resultsFull list of Ivermectin studies and details:  https://c19ivermectin.comVitamin D74 studies conducted by over 650 scientists52 sufficiency studies with 12,000 patients23 treatment trials with 23,000 patients53% improvement in 23 treatment trials53% improvement in 52 sufficiency studies63% improvement in 14 treatment mortality resultsFull list of Vitamin D studies and details:  https://c19vitamind.comPlease share this information. 

- The inept policies and measures being taken by our federal health officials and by both the former Trump and present Biden administrations are unparalleled in American healthcare history. 

- "Since all of these analyses were statistically adjusted for multiple personal and medical factors (i.e., age, sex, weight, smoking, diabetes, blood pressure, etc., plus blood omega-6 fatty acid levels), we believe that these are the strongest data published to date supporting the view that over the long-term, having higher blood omega-3 levels can help maintain better overall health," Dr Harris concluded.New study shows tree nuts may play a role in both weight loss and weight maintenanceUniversity of California at Los Angeles, May 4, 2021In a randomized, controlled study* published online in the journal, Nutrients, researchers found that including mixed tree nuts in a weight management program resulted in significant weight loss and improved satiety.Researchers at UCLA compared 95 overweight/obese men and women (BMI 27.0-35.0 kg/m2) ages 30-68 years who consumed either 1.5 ounces of mixed tree nuts or a pretzel snack. 

- "Tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts) are a great source of protein, healthy fats and fiber," explained lead researcher, Zhaoping Li, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at UCLA. 

- ** During the past year many Americans have gained weight while sheltering in place, partly due to less exercise and more snacking. 

- "By replacing just one of those snacks with 1.5 ounces of tree nuts may result in a positive impact on weight and overall health. 

- "According to Maureen Ternus, M.S., R.D.N, Executive Director of the International Tree Nut Council Nutrition Research & Education Foundation (INC NREF), "This latest study adds to a growing body of evidence showing that nut consumption may be a useful tool in weight management. 

- In addition, it was observed a significant decrease in levels of depression and abdominal fat.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “EGCG combined with coconut oil increase the concentration of albumin in blood and produce less depression in MS patients.”Vulnerable older people at greater risk of depression and anxiety during pandemicUniversity of Manchester (UK), May 5, 2021Older people who are clinically vulnerable to COVID-19 are at greater risk of deterioration in health and social well-being during the pandemic, according to a new study.The research, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, found that older people were more likely to report worse health outcomes than those with no clinical vulnerabilities, including greater depression and anxiety and lower quality of life, even when taking into account pre-pandemic levels of health and social well-being.The findings highlight the need for policymakers to consider the mental and physical health consequences of the pandemic for those at higher risk from coronavirus, particularly for those asked to shield.Professor Debora Price from The University of Manchester and Dr. Giorgio Di Gessa from UCL compared data from 2020's English Longitudinal Study of Aging with data from the previous year. 

- They analyzed responses from over 5000 people aged 52 and over in private households in England.The study revealed that during the pandemic, respondents classified as clinically vulnerable were more likely to report poor self-rated health, lower levels of physical activity, depression, anxiety, lower quality of life as well as loneliness and receipt of care, compared to those without clinical vulnerabilities.This was true within each age group. 

- Those in their 80s—regardless of clinical vulnerability—were much more likely to have unmet care needs and to have little contact with friends and family by text, email, or videocall.Although older adults' health and social well-being have been impacted by shielding, the researchers found that it was those who were clinically vulnerable and shielding who reported the most substantial rises in anxiety, depression, poor self-rated health and receipt of formal care, as well as decreases in well-being and physical activity. 

- "Older people with underlying health conditions, even before the pandemic, faced challenges in terms of access to healthcare services and social contact," said Professor Debora Price. 

- "It's vital that policymakers are aware that when advised to stay at home, a host of health and social risks for this group, already poor, are likely to be exacerbated. 

- The study also shows that increased physical activity can positively modify, or even negate, this reduction in brain blood flow.The study contains relevant information which is of great interest to the general public; since reduced blood flow in the brain, or 'cerebral hypoperfusion," is an early mechanism in vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.Obesity and health challengesAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), obesity is a worsening health crisis that has reached epidemic proportions globally, with over 1 billion adults overweight—and at least 300 million clinically obese. 

- It continues to be a major contributor to global rates of chronic disease and disability, affecting overall quality of life, while placing increased strain on the immune system which is of the upmost importance given the current COVID-19 situation. 

- Obesity is also a significant public health concern given its negative impact on physiological function, especially as we age. 

- Finding easily implemented and cost-effective ways to tackle the impact of obesity is particularly important to help protect against negative health outcomes in later life.What are the findings of the TILDA study?The study investigates three different measures of obesity—body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference, as well as physical activity, in adults over 50 years.Brain blood flow was measured using cutting-edge MRI scanning and analysis techniques. 

- If brain blood flow becomes impaired, it can lead to serious health issues as we age, such as increasing the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. 

- We know that obesity can predispose a person to age-related conditions, illness, and disease, and even reduce life expectancy by up to six years in men and seven years in women, after the age of forty. 

- The study also shows the importance of being physically active for older overweight or obese individuals, as this may help to protect against reduced brain blood flow and the poor health outcomes that can arise from this.Professor Rose Anne Kenny, Principal Investigator of TILDA, and co-author of the study, said: "Many experts have shown that obesity and aging have very similar effects on the biology of aging; diseases associated with obesity are similar to those of aging and age-related diseases—heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney failure, arthritis, susceptibility to infections- including COVID-19. 

- "Our study not only shows that there is a link between obesity and reduced brainblood flow, but also that it is possible to protect against the negative consequences of obesity through regular physical exercise. 

- Whereas these findings are of relevance in the global context, because of the rapidly evolving global burden of obesity, the research is especially important to Irish adults because obesity and being overweight is a considerable health issue in Ireland.Previous TILDA research has shown that over one-third of Irish adults aged 50 and older are obese and a further 43% overweight. 

- As we prepare our society for a growing aging population, we can use this evidence to prepare meaningful public health policies that will promote impactful and positive lifestyle habits, such as regular physical activity, to mitigate against some of the negative consequences of the growing obesity crisis.In silico screening of Chinese herbal medicines with the potential to directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirusShanghai Health Commission Key Lab of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Based Management of Inflammation and Chronic Diseases, May 2, 2021ObjectiveIn this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia.MethodsThere were two main steps in the screening process. 

- Further, considering that the biologically validated natural compounds reported in the literature cannot cover all antiviral natural compounds, and the natural compounds included in the Chinese medicine database are not complete, the process that we have followed may have excluded herbs that would be well suited to this treatment. 

- Treatment with Rhodiola mimics exercise to resist high-fat diet-induced muscle dysfunctionCentral South University (China), April 30, 2021According to news reporting out of Changsha, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Muscle dysfunction is a complication of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity that could be prevented by exercise, but patients did not get enough therapeutic efficacy from exercise due to multiple reasons.”The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Xiangya Hospital of Central South University: “To explore alternative or supplementary approaches to prevent or treat muscle dysfunction in individuals with obesity, we investigated the effects of Rhodiola on muscle dysfunction as exercise pills. 

- SIRT1 might suppress atrogenes expression and improve mitochondrial quality control, which could be a therapeutic target stimulated by exercise and Rhodiola, but further mechanisms remain unclear. 

- Moreover, exercise and Rhodiola were used to intervene mice with a HFD. 

- Our results showed that exercise and Rhodiola prevented muscle atrophy and dysfunction in obese mice and activating the SIRT1 pathway, while atrogenes were suppressed and mitochondrial quality control was improved. 

- Overall, Rhodiola mimics exercise that activates SIRT1 signaling leading to improvement of HFD-induced muscle dysfunction.”Prenatal exposure to pesticides increases the risk of obesity in adolescenceFirst study to analyse the long-term effects of persistent organic pollutants on cardiometabolic risk in adolescentsBarcelona Institute for Global Health (Spain), May 3, 2021Exposure before birth to persistent organic pollutants (POPs)-- organochlorine pesticides, industrial chemicals, etc.--may increase the risk in adolescence of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and high blood pressure. 

- This was the main conclusion of a study by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a research centre supported by the "la Caixa" Foundation. 

- POPs have adverse effects on both human health and the environment and their use is regulated globally.Prenatal exposure to these substances has been associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in childhood, but there were previously no studies assessing whether such associations continue into adolescence, a developmental stage characterised by significant changes in the endocrine system and rapid increases in body mass.The aim of this investigation, carried out within the framework of the INMA Project-Environment and Childhood, was to study the associations between prenatal exposure to POPs and body mass index (BMI) as well as other markers of cardiovascular risk in adolescence. 

- In her view "more studies are needed in this field, especially focussing on childhood and adolescence, which are critical developmental stages characterised by particular vulnerability".One cup of leafy green vegetables a day lowers risk of heart diseaseResearch has found that by eating just one cup of nitrate-rich vegetables each day people can significantly reduce their risk of heart disease.Edith Cowan University (Australia), May 4, 2021New Edith Cowan University (ECU) research has found that by eating just one cup of nitrate-rich vegetables each day people can significantly reduce their risk of heart disease.The study investigated whether people who regularly ate higher quantities of nitrate-rich vegetables, such as leafy greens and beetroot, had lower blood pressure, and it also examined whether these same people were less likely to be diagnosed with heart disease many years later.Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally, taking around 17.9 million lives each year.Researchers examined data from over 50,000 people residing in Denmark taking part in the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study over a 23-year period. 

- They found that people who consumed the most nitrate-rich vegetables had about a 2.5 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure and between 12 to 26 percent lower risk of heart disease.Lead researcher Dr Catherine Bondonno from ECU's Institute for Nutrition Research said identifying diets to prevent heart disease was a priority. 

- "Our results have shown that by simply eating one cup of raw (or half a cup of cooked) nitrate-rich vegetables each day, people may be able to significantly reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease," Dr Bondonno said. 

- "The greatest reduction in risk was for peripheral artery disease (26 percent), a type of heart disease characterised by the narrowing of blood vessels of the legs, however we also found people had a lower risk of heart attacks, strokes and heart failure. 

- "People don't need to be taking supplements to boost their nitrate levels because the study showed that one cup of leafy green vegetables each day is enough to reap the benefits for heart disease," Dr Bondonno said. 

- Juicing vegetables removes the pulp and fibre," Dr Bondonno said.The paper "Vegetable nitrate intake, blood pressure and incident cardiovascular disease: Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study" is published in the European Journal of Epidemiology. 

- It is a collaboration between Edith Cowan University, the Danish Cancer Society and The University of Western Australia.The research adds to growing evidence linking vegetables generally and leafy greens specifically with improved cardiovascular health and muscle strength. 

- This evidence includes two recent ECU studies exploring cruciferous vegetables and blood vessel health and green leafy vegetables and muscle strength.Mindfulness programs can boost children's mental healthUniversity of Derby (UK), May 4, 2021Mindfulness programs can improve the mental health of school-age children and help them to feel more optimistic, according to new research from the University of Derby and Derbyshire Educational Psychology Service.More than 1,000 pupils aged between 9-12 years old across 25 schools in Derbyshire, received one 45-minute mindfulness session per week for nine weeks during the year-long project, which involved a collaboration between Dr. William Van Gordon, Associate Professor in Contemplative Psychology at the University, and Derbyshire Educational Psychology Service.Mindfulness is an ancient meditation technique that involves focussing awareness on the present moment, as a means of fostering calm, wellbeing and insight. 

- "These findings are also in line with the view that preventative interventions given at a young age can help to reduce the incidence of mental health problems in young people. 

- "Vitamin D levels higher in exercisersJohns Hopkins University, May 01 2021The issue of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism published the finding of researchers at Johns Hopkins University of a correlation between increased physical activity and higher levels of vitamin D. Higher levels of vitamin D and exercise was also associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.The study included 10,342 men and women who were free of coronary heart disease and heart failure upon enrollment in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. 

- Subjects in the recommended activity group with levels of vitamin D of 30 ng/mL or more had a 24% lower risk of cardiovascular disease.The association between exercise and vitamin D was stronger in subjects of European ethnicity than among African Americans. 

- The authors noted that European-Americans as well as those who engage in exercise are likelier to be supplement users. 

- "The bottom line is we need to encourage people to move more in the name of heart health. 

- Furthermore, an analysis of the participants with relatively high postprandial blood glucose showed that the plasma glucose concentration 2 h after a 75-g glucose load was significantly lower in the trehalose group than in the sucrose group.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that trehalose helps lower postprandial blood glucose in healthy humans with higher postprandial glucose levels within the normal range, and may therefore contribute to the prevention of pathologies that are predisposed to by postprandial hyperglycemia,, even if the daily intake of trehalose is only 3.3 g, an amount that is easily incorporated into a meal.Coffee compound enhances autophagy to protect against cell injuryChengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (China), April 30, 2021According to news reporting originating from Sichuan, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Autophagy serves an important role in amyloid-beta (A beta) metabolism and tau processing and clearance in Alzheimer’s disease. 

- The buildup of this protein promotes the expression of cancer genes (oncogenes) and the progression of tumors.In an earlier study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, German researchers reported that lycopene is the most effective scavenger of singlet oxygen, a very strong oxidant and one of the major ROS produced by cells. 

- They measured the cells’ ROS levels and viability before and after treatment.The researchers found that lycopene effectively reduced ROS levels and inhibited not only the activation of Jak1/Stat3 and Wnt/B-catenin signaling but also the expression of B-catenin target oncogenes and the proliferation of H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells. 

- "But we didn't know exactly what was happening in the cells," says Dr. Sabrina Geisberger of the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology (BIMSB) at the MDC. 

- Nutrition experts recommend that adults limit their daily intake to five or six grams at most. 

- Nevertheless, the study confirms that consuming too much salt can be bad for our health. 

- If such an important cellular mechanism is disrupted for a long period, it could have a negative impact - and could potentially drive inflammatory diseases of the blood vessels or joints, or autoimmune diseases," says Kleinewietfeld.Ginkgo biloba extract improves cognitive function and increases neurogenesis by reducing amyloid beta pathologyXuzhou Medical University (China), May 1, 2021According to news reporting from Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Previous studies have indicated that the generation of newborn hippocampal neurons is impaired in the early phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 

- A potential therapeutic strategy being pursued for the treatment of AD is increasing the number of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Xuzhou Medical University, “Recent studies have demonstrated that ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) plays a neuroprotective role by preventing memory loss in many neurodegenerative diseases. 

- Further analysis indicated that EGb 761 can reduce the number of A beta positive signals in 5xFAD mice, increase the number of newborn neurons, and increase dendritic branching and density of dendritic spines in 5xFAD mice compared to nontreated 5xFAD mice.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “It was concluded that EGb 761 plays a protective role in the memory deficit of 5xFAD mice.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Fasting lowers blood pressure by reshaping the gut microbiotaBaylor College of Medicine, April 30 2021Nearly half of adults in the United States have hypertension, a condition that raises the risk for heart disease and stroke, which are leading causes of death in the U. S.At Baylor College of Medicine, Dr. David J. Durgan and his colleagues are dedicated to better understand hypertension, in particular the emerging evidence suggesting that disruption of the gut microbiota, known as gut dysbiosis, can have adverse effects on blood pressure. 

- Fasting schedules could one day help regulate the activity of gut microbial populations to naturally provide health benefits.Study: Following healthy diets found to reduce the risk of acquired hearing loss by 30%Brigham and Women's Hospital, April 30, 2021A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology suggests that following a healthy diet may help ward off acquired hearing loss. 

- The researchers wished to learn more about this connection by tracking people’s diets and measuring changes in their hearing sensitivity over a long period of time.To do so, the researchers studied 20 years of dietary intake information from over 3,000 women with a median age of 59 who were included in the Nurses’ Health Study II. 

- Using this information, they examined how closely the women’s long-term diets resembled the Alternate Mediterranean diet (AMED), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH diet) and Alternate Healthy Index-2010 (AHEI-2010).AMED is a version of the Mediterranean diet adapted to reflect eating patterns that are linked to a lower risk of chronic disease, while the DASH diet is intended to control and prevent high blood pressure. 

- On the other hand, AHEI-2010 is based on the 2010 U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans and shares similar components with AMED and the DASH diet.Past studies linked adherence to these diets to a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, hypertension and premature death.To measure the participants’ hearing sensitivity over the course of three years, the team put up 19 testing sites across the country and trained audiologists to measure changes in the participants’ pure-tone hearing thresholds – the lowest and highest pitch (frequency of a sound) that a person can detect in one ear.The researchers found that the odds of hearing loss in the mid-frequencies were nearly 30 percent lower in the women whose dietary patterns resembled the three diets, compared to those whose diets least resembled them. 

- The frequencies encompassed in these associations, according to the researchers, are critical for speech understanding.“We were surprised that so many women demonstrated hearing decline over such a relatively short period of time,” said Sharon Curhan, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and the lead researcher of the study.After only three years, nineteen percent of the participants had low-frequency hearing loss, 38 percent had mid-frequency hearing loss, while nearly half had high-frequency hearing loss. 

- Their findings were published in the Journal of Integrative Medicine.Sexual health positively correlates with overall well-being.Current strategies that are meant to enhance male sexual health are limited by many factors, such as responsiveness, adherence and adverse effects.Researchers understand the need for safe and effective interventions that could help preserve male sexual function.K. 

- parviflora, a plant from the Zingiberaceae (ginger) family, has been found to support cardiovascular health and has shown signs that it could ameliorate erectile dysfunction.To investigate this, the researchers conducted an open-label, one-arm study involving 14 generally healthy males aged 50 to 68 years with self-reported mild erectile dysfunction.The participants received 100 mg of an extract obtained from the rhizome of K. parviflora daily for 30 days.Primary efficacy analyses included the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), while secondary efficacy analyses included the Global Assessment Question about erectile function.The researchers reported that 13 of the 14 participants completed the study. 

- Dietary supplements formulated with highly bioavailable curcumin may allow for faster recovery after competition-level training, and blunt training-related decreases in performance , says new data presented at Experimental Biology.Using OmniActive's supplement ingredient, scientists reported that supplementation for eight weeks resulted in significant reductions in levels of creatine kinase, a marker of muscle damage, while self-reported pain scores were also significantly lower 24 hours post-exercise.A daily 200 mg dose of curcuminoids (in the form of 1,000 mg supplement) was also associated with a decrease in performance declines observed during"These data suggest that high dose bioavailable curcumin (200 mg curcuminoids) attenuates performance decrements following downhill running, eccentric loading, which may improve subsequent adaptations to chronic training," wrote the researchers in the FASEB Journal .Dr Ralf Jager from Wisconsin-based Increnovo and co-author on the study reports, explained that curcumin's sports nutrition benefits were linked to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential.Muscle Damage StudyThe researchers recruited 59 moderately trained men and 29 women with an average age of 21 to participate in their double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled parallel design study. 

- The participants were randomly assigned to receive 250 mg or 1,000 mg of supplement or placebo per day for eight weeks.The data indicated that, following muscle-damaging exercise, the high dose curcumin group experienced significantly lower pain scores, while increases in creatine kinase (CK) levels were also significantly reduced compared to placebo, when the baseline CK value is held constant at the mean. 

- "These data demonstrate curcuminoids reduce muscle damage and improve muscle soreness in healthy young subjects following a bout of muscle damaging exercise. 

- "Further study is warranted in other exercise types (i.e. 

- Avocado discovery may point to leukemia treatmentUniversity of Guelph (Canada), May 1, 2021A compound in avocados may ultimately offer a route to better leukemia treatment, says a new University of Guelph study.The compound targets an enzyme that scientists have identified for the first time as being critical to cancer cell growth, said Dr. Paul Spagnuolo, Department of Food Science.Published recently in the journal Blood, the study focused on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is the most devastating form of leukemia. 

- Betaine supplements are already used clinically to treat the metabolic disease homocystinuria.“I don’t encourage anyone to take betaine for no reason, if a doctor has not recommended it. 

- Hirokawa has been a member of the Japan Academy, a national honorary organization recognizing scientific achievement, since 2004 and received a Person of Cultural Merit award from the Japanese government in 2013.Schizophrenia is estimated to affect about 1 in 100 people globally and is one of the top 15 leading causes of disability worldwide.“There are treatments for schizophrenia, but they have side effects and unfortunately there is still no effective drug for patients to take that we can explain biochemically why it works,” explained Hirokawa.Genetic studies of people diagnosed with schizophrenia have found possible links between the disease and variations in the kinesin family 3b (kif3b) gene as well as another gene involved in the body’s internal synthesis of betaine.Hirokawa and his lab members have categorized all 45 members of the kinesin superfamily of genes in mammals, most of which encode motor proteins that move materials throughout the cell. 

- Betaine likely eliminates the carbonyl stress portion of the schizophrenia equation,” said Hirokawa.By protecting CRMP2 from damage, betaine treatment allows kif3b mutant neurons to build proper structures. 

- Other test tube experiments revealed that KIF3B and CRMP2 can bind together, but their exact relationship remains unclear.“We know that the amount of betaine decreases in schizophrenia patients’ brains, so this study strongly suggests betaine could be therapeutic for at least some kinds of schizophrenia,” said Hirokawa.The UTokyo research team is planning future collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and clinical studies of betaine supplements as a treatment for schizophrenia.Study reveals your neighbourhood may affect your brain healthUniversity of Wisconsin School of Medicine, April 20, 2021Middle-aged and older people living in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods — areas with higher poverty levels and fewer educational and employment opportunities–had more brain shrinkage on brain scans and showed a faster decline on cognitive tests than people living in neighbourhoods with fewer disadvantages, according to a new study.The study published in the online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. 

- Researchers say such brain ageing may be a sign of the earliest stages of dementia.“Worldwide, dementia is a major cause of illness and a devastating diagnosis,” said study author Amy J. H. Kind M.D., PhD, of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison.“There are currently no treatments to cure the disease, so identifying possible modifiable risk factors is important. 

- Compelling evidence exists that the social, economic, cultural and physical conditions in which humans live may affect health. 

- We wanted to determine if these neighbourhood conditions increase the risk for the neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.”For the study, researchers identified 601 people from two larger studies of Wisconsin residents. 

- Researchers also found a higher rate of decline on tests that measure the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.“Our findings suggest that increased vigilance by healthcare providers for early signs of dementia may be particularly important in this vulnerable population,” said Kind. 

- Further research into possible social and biological pathways may help physicians, researchers and policymakers identify effective avenues for prevention and intervention in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia.”Limitations of the study included a small number of participants from highly disadvantaged neighbourhoods and a limited geographic setting. 

- Moreover, 8 weeks treatment of nondiabetic rats with ALA led to the development of profibrotic features reflected in increased collagen synthesis/deposition. 

- Besides the TGF-beta 1 downstream signaling, the additional mechanism underlying the upregulation of collagen IV in nondiabetic rats treated with ALA involves decreased DNA methylation of its promoter that could arise from increased Tet1 expression.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “These findings emphasize the therapeutic caution in the use of ALA, especially in patients with renal diabetic complication.”Obesity, high-salt diet pose different cardiovascular risks in females, malesMedical College of Georgia at Augusta University, April 30, 2021Obesity and a high-salt diet are both bad for our hearts but they are bigger, seemingly synergistic risks for females, scientists report.“We see younger and younger women having cardiovascular disease and the question is: What is the cause?” says Dr. Eric Belin de Chantemele, physiologist in the Vascular Biology Center and Department of Medicine at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. 

- “We think the fact that females are more salt sensitive and more sensitive to obesity are among the reasons they have lost the natural protection youth and estrogen are thought to provide.”His message to women based on the sex differences they are finding: “First reduce your consumption of salt, a message the American Heart Association has been pushing for years, which should also result in a reduction in your intake of highly processed, high-calorie food and drink.”Belin de Chantemele, whose research team has been exploring why so many young women are now getting cardiovascular disease, is presenting their findings during the Henry Pickering Bowditch Award Lectureship at the American Physiological Society Annual Meeting at Experimental Biology 2021 this week. 

- The award, which honors the scientist who created the first physiology lab in the country and was the American Physiological Society’s first president, recognizes original and outstanding accomplishments in the field of physiology by a young investigator.The sex hormone estrogen, which has some protective powers like keeping blood vessels more flexible, is considered a natural protection for premenopausal women yet, along with soaring rates of severe obesity in young women, heart disease is now the third leading cause of death in females between the ages 20-44 — fourth for males in that age group — then moves up to second place for the next 20 years in both sexes, and is the number one killer for both men and women looking at all ages, according to the National Vital Statistics Reports.While he refers to bad nutrition as the “world’s biggest killer” and obesity as a major risk factor for hypertension in both sexes, his lab has mounting evidence that obesity and high salt intake are even bigger risks for females, who have naturally higher levels of two additional hormones, leptin and aldosterone, setting the stage for the potentially deadly cardiovascular disparities.Many of us likely think of leptin as the “satiety hormone” that sends our brain cues to stop eating when our stomach is full, but in obesity, the brain typically stops listening to the full message but the cardiovascular system of women starts getting unhealthy cues.Belin de Chantemele has shown that in females leptin prompts the adrenal glands, which make aldosterone, to make even more of this powerful blood vessel constrictor. 

- Treatment with the aldosterone agonist eplerenone helped correct both.Because females already make more aldosterone, and the normal response of the body when you eat a lot of salt is to make even more aldosterone to help eliminate some of it, his team now proposes that females appear to have an impaired ability to reduce both the levels of the enzyme that makes aldosterone and the hormone itself, which makes them more salt sensitive.One thing that means is that salt raises females’ blood pressure without them actually retaining more salt than the males. 

- It also means that they think that blood vessels are more important in blood pressure regulation in females than males, which means they may need different treatment than males. 

- To further compound the scenario, high salt increases the adrenal leptin receptor in the females, providing more points of action for leptin, which probably helps explain why aldosterone levels don’t decrease in females like they do in males.A new $2.6 million grant (1R01HL155265-01) from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute is enabling them to further investigate, in both lab animals and human tissue, the female’s unique responses to a high-salt diet, include the specific contributions of the failure of aldosterone levels to drop, along with the increased expression of aldosterone and leptin receptors.While trends in being overweight in about the last 50 years have held pretty steady for men and women, with decreases for men in the last handful of years, rates of severe obesity have been climbing, with women far outpacing men.“We want to continue to put the puzzle together with the goal of helping restore protection from cardiovascular disease to young women, when a healthy diet and increased physical activity do not,” Belin de Chantemele says.His research team includes Galina Antonova, research assistant; Dr. Reem Atawia, postdoctoral fellow; Simone Kennard, research associate; Taylor Kress and Candee Barris, graduate students; Vinay Mehta, undergraduate student at AU, Laszlo Kovacs, assistant research scientist; and Dr. Jessica Faulkner, postdoctoral fellow.Just 10 minutes of meditation helps anxious people have better focusUniversity of Waterloo (Canada) May 1, 2021Just 10 minutes of daily mindful meditation can help prevent your mind from wandering and is particularly effective if you tend to have repetitive, anxious thoughts, according to a study from the University of Waterloo.The study, which assessed the impact of meditation with 82 participants who experience anxiety, found that developing an awareness of the present moment reduced incidents of repetitive, off-task thinking, a hallmark of anxiety.“Our results indicate that mindfulness training may have protective effects on mind wandering for anxious individuals,” said Mengran Xu, a researcher and PhD candidate at Waterloo. 

- Researchers then put the participants into two groups at random, with the control group given an audio story to listen to and the other group asked to engage in a short meditation exercise prior to being reassessed.“Mind wandering accounts for nearly half of any person’s daily stream of consciousness,” said Xu. 

- “For people with anxiety, repetitive off-task thoughts can negatively affect their ability to learn, to complete tasks, or even function safely.“It would be interesting to see what the impacts would be if mindful meditation was practiced by anxious populations more widely.”The study, co-authored by Waterloo psychology professors Christine Purdon and Daniel Smilek and Harvard University’s Paul Seli, was published in Consciousness and Cognition.Researchers find breastfeeding linked to higher neurocognitive testing scoresUniversity of Rochester Medical Center, April 27, 2021New research finds that children who were breastfed scored higher on neurocognitive tests. 

- Researchers in the Del Monte Institute for Neuroscience at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) analyzed thousands of cognitive tests taken by nine and ten-year-olds whose mothers reported they were breastfed, and compared those results to scores of children who were not.“Our findings suggest that any amount of breastfeeding has a positive cognitive impact, even after just a few months.” Daniel Adan Lopez, Ph.D. candidate in the Epidemiology program who is first author on the study recently published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health. 

- Hopefully from a policy standpoint, this can help improve the motivation to breastfeed.”Hayley Martin, Ph.D., a fourth year medical student in the Medical Scientist Training Program and co-author of the study, focuses her research on breastfeeding. 

- But all scores were higher when compared to children who didn’t breastfeed at all.” Previous studies found breastfeeding does not impact executive function or memory, findings in this study made similar findings.“This supports the foundation of work already being done around lactation and breastfeeding and its impact on a child’s health,” said Ed Freedman, Ph.D., the principal investigator of the ABCD study in Rochester and lead author of the study. 

- The Weaponization of the CDC Against Public HealthRichard Gale and Gary NullProgressive Radio Network, April 30, 2021What if you were to know that a cabal of corrupt bureaucrats and scientists at the heart of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have known for almost two decades that vaccines, including the MMR, can lead to autism and other neurological disorders? 

- We need to begin to understand that the agency operates as an independent “deep state,” secretive, non-transparent, and conducting itself in covert ways behind the disguise of heralding public health. 

- Stone wrote, “Every government is run by liars, and nothing they say should be believed,” he may have just as well been speaking about the CDC and its alliance with the pharmaceutical industry, many medical journals, and the mainstream media.The money-driven institutions of evidence-based medicine and science, which have hijacked America's health agencies--the CDC, FDA, Health and Human Services (HHS), National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Mental Health, the National Cancer Institute, and the USDA-- have plunged a stake into the heart of authentic scientific inquiry, knowledge and innovative medical progress. 

- And after a Congressional Government Reform Committee brought CDC officials to testify before legislators, the Committee concluded the agency had routinely allowed scientists with conflicts of interest with pharmaceutical companies to serve on its two advisory committees that make recommendations on vaccine policyThe blurring of the lines between the pharmaceutical industry and our federal health agencies has been a scandal evolving over the course of several decades. 

- The MMR is manufactured by Merck.Robert Kennedy Jr, one of the nation’s expert watchdogs in the corporatization of our federal medical establishment, has called the CDC "a cesspool of corruption." 

- Unlike the FDA, which has a contract with the American public to assure warnings about health risks and contraindications of registered drugs and medical devices, the CDC has no such contract with the nation's citizenry. 

- For this reason it may be best regarded as an intelligence agency rather than an institution committed to public health.One recent example of the CDC's covert activities took place in 2016. 

- The CDC's partnership and fellowship programs with the Association of Health Care Journalists is nothing less than an intelligence indoctrination program to train journalists to be the mouthpieces of the CDC's fake science. 

- The curriculum held at the CDC's Atlanta campus includes propaganda in federal health policies, epidemiology (no authentic gold standard biological science), pandemic preparedness, vaccine safety and autism. 

- It is not exclusively concerned with the physical and mental health of the nation. 

- During the past years, this has further grown into spying and covert operations against the critics of our national health and immunization policies. 

- Therefore, no longer are vaccines simply a public health intervention. 

- These policies are left for politicians to debate, which is rarely done, and is no longer open for discussion among expert medical researchers outside of the CDC’s ranks and its network of trolls, shills and medical puppets spewing disinformation into the public sector. 

- This has given rise to a 2015 British Medical Journalinvestigative report accusing the CDC of becoming a lapdog for commercial interests.The CDC also controls a separate non-profit institution known as the CDC Foundation, which operates like an astro turf organization. 

- Bush’s Preventative Health Act, the Foundation operates outside of Congressional oversight. 

- The purpose of the Foundation shall be to support and carry out activities for the prevention and control of diseases, disorders, injuries and disabilities, and for promotion of public health… the Foundation shall establish a fund for providing endowments for positions that are associated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention…”In other words, the Foundation has been established as a recruiting service, funded by non-Federal sources, which can include private corporations and drug makers, for the sole purpose to serving the tax-funded CDC. 

- For example, the CDC Foundation receives large donations from Pepsi and Coca Cola, and thereby exerts its influence to taint national guidelines about diabetes, liver disease and other illnesses. 

- In 2013, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave $13.5 million to support the CDC’s efforts to undertake surveillance and increase meningitis and rotavirus vaccination rates in Sub-Sahara Africa.Furthermore, the Centers' activities are no longer limited to the US' domestic health; after 911, its mission expanded, far beyond its original mandate, and today the agency is globally engaged. 

- On the Centers’ website, it defines itself as America's "Global Health Protection Agency" in charge of "implementing global health security" and works in partnership with other nations. 

- Since 2006, the CDC claimed it had trained over 115,000 professional personnel in its interpretation of health issues. 

- It’s Global Rapid Response Team of over 400 experts "can deploy in as little as 48 hours" to respond to local and regional health emergencies. 

- These are among the defining characteristics of an intelligence agency.Other intelligence activities often associated with a “deep state” and now undertaken by the CDC include pressuring peer-reviewed medical journals to retract studies that challenge their ideology or endanger the agency's reputation. 

- Hidden within the corridors on the University of Southern California campus is the relatively unknown organization Hollywood Health and Society. 

- The small organization's mission is to provide "briefings and consultations with experts, case examples, panel discussions about timely health issues" for Hollywood script writers and producers. 

- Given Gate's utter disdain towards voices speaking out against vaccines, we can be certain this was not for humanitarian, research purposes but as part of intelligence gathering in the CDC's war against the health of the nation. 

- Manipulating this ignorance with heavy doses of fear tactics, such as revealed through the CDC's press model to guide the mainstream media's role in increasing vaccine compliance, health officials have managed to successfully thwart many efforts to educate the public to evaluate the pros and cons of vaccination.Along with the corporatization of Washington's three branches of government, and the emergence of a surveillance state watching over the shoulders of every citizen, the politicization of medicine, particularly vaccines, is another sign of the further decay of the nation towards totalitarianism. 

- For almost two decades, fake news and bureaucratic deception, anger, hatred and disproportional distrust has taken the spotlight as the nation's health further erodes. 

- Annually, the quality of Americans' health is declining and this is most evident in the younger generations who have received the bulk of vaccines. 

- A doctorate in science or a medical degree from Harvard does not excuse a person from duplicitous chicanery.The good news is that the tide is slowly turning. 

- Autism rates continue to rise and parents are able to access extensive independent medical research to understand the real dangers of vaccines. 

- There is no secret why federal health officials and their absolutist claims to mandate vaccine compliance are untrustworthy. 

- In 2016 over 1500 medical researchers surveyed by the prestigious journal Nature failed to reproduce another scientist's experimental results. 

- However, most important is that no single scientific study or paper can claim to be the final word on any medical issue, and this is especially true with vaccine research. 

- In contrast, vaccine science continues to rely partially upon an antiquated understanding of the body's immune system focused almost exclusively on antibody generation.One example of medical negligence has been the rising epidemic of citizens who are immune-compromised and therefore most susceptible to adverse vaccine reactions. 

- When this question was posed to a researcher at Johns Hopkins University in 2015, to his surprise Theo Schall discovered there were no population accurate statistics and none of our federal health agencies nor medical institutions were tracking it. 

- Volumes of medical and biochemical research confirming the severe vaccine ingredients are also ignored. 

- Nor do pediatricians routinely evaluate the state of children's immunological health before determining whether or not to administer vaccines. 

- Nevertheless, the cumulative financial cost of all previous government sponsored fake science would be a small price to pay for the future well-being of children.During Congressional proceedings in 2002 into the causes for the unaccountable rise in autism in the United States, CDC officials confirmed no studies have been undertaken to compare the quality of health between vaccinated and unvaccinated children. 

- Officials at the CDC and Department of Health and Human Services know perfectly well that vaccinated children are susceptible to far more allergies and illnesses than their unvaccinated peers. 

- Otherwise, the necessary research to prove the health advantages of vaccines would have been conducted long ago.Yet there are reasons why such studies are not mandated nor funded. 

- Health agencies are fully aware that vaccines are a scourge. 

- Such studies, which are little more than algorithmic equations for sifting, shifting and fudging data, are scientifically invalid for determining any medical truth. 

- The agency has also been discovered to mislead the nation on other health issues that in turn shape government policies. 

- Later Time magazine reported that the manner the CDC gathered its information was extremely flawed and biased.In 2016 The Hill reported that the CDC misled Congress with its WISEWOMAN project --  a national screening and evaluation project to help reduce heart disease risks in women between 40-64 and to promote healthier lifestyles. 

- Anti-aging compound improves muscle glucose metabolism in peopleWashington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, April 26, 2021A natural compound previously demonstrated to counteract aspects of aging and improve metabolic health in mice has clinically relevant effects in people, according to new research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.A small clinical trial of postmenopausal women with prediabetes shows that the compound NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) improved the ability of insulin to increase glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, which often is abnormal in people with obesity, prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes. 

- However, the treatment did not lower blood glucose or blood pressure, improve blood lipid profile, increase insulin sensitivity in the liver, reduce fat in the liver or decrease circulating markers of inflammation as seen in mice.The study, published online April 22 in the journal Science, is the first randomized clinical trial to look at the metabolic effects of NMN administration in people.Among the women in the study, 13 received 250 mg of NMN orally every day for 10 weeks, and 12 were given an inactive placebo every day over the same period. 

- "Although our study shows a beneficial effect of NMN in skeletal muscle, it is premature to make any clinical recommendations based on the results from our study," said senior investigator Samuel Klein, MD, the William H. Danforth Professor of Medicine and Nutritional Science and director of the Center for Human Nutrition. 

- "Normally, when a treatment improves insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, as is observed with weight loss or some diabetes medications, there also are related improvements in other markers of metabolic health, which we did not detect in our study participants. 

- The findings build on mounting evidence of the adverse effects drinking soda and other sugary beverages have on the body, which include obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, dental caries and gout.The team collated data from the National Health and Examination Surveys, an annual program for assessing the health and nutrition of American adults and children. 

- They gathered data from over 5,300 participants between 1999 and 2002, all of whom had no history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease.In particular, they looked at stored DNA data from the participants – measuring telomere length and comparing it with their consumption of sugar-sweetened soda. 

- Having shorter telomere length, for instance, has been linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes and even certain types of cancer.The team reported in their study that consuming even just eight ounces of soda every day can accelerate aging by nearly two years. 

- Telomere shortening starts long before disease onset,” Epel added. 

- The researchers collected data from more than 450,000 individuals enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, a large-scale cohort study for biochemical and genetic markers for cancer and other chronic diseases.A follow-up revealed that more than 40,000 participants from the original study had already died. 

- Those who regularly drank more than two glasses of sugary drinks increased their risk of dying from circulatory diseases, while those who drank at least one glass of sugary drinks increased their risk of dying from digestive diseases and Parkinson’s disease.“Our results … provide additional support for the possible adverse health effects of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and to replace them with other healthier beverages, preferably water,” explained co-author Neil Murphy. 

- Despite the 17 claims for its anti-inflammatory and digestive health properties, there are currently no approved health claims for curcumin in the EU.These claims are featured on the 2000+ list of on-hold botanical claims yet to be processed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).As well as Arjuna, other manufacturers with an interest in curcumin include herbal manufacturers Sabinsa and Italian botanicals firm Indena.Led by Dr Shusuke Toden, research associate from Baylor University in the US, the trial compared ETO-curcumin preparations  against standard curcumin at three specific doses (0, 5, 25 or 50 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg)).These doses were administered to an animal model with induced colitis for seven days.The research team found that ETO-curcumin improved disease activity index (DAI) dose-dependently, while the anti-inflammatory efficacy of standard curcumin remained constant.“This suggests that ETO-curcumin may provide superior anti-inflammatory efficacy compared to standard curcumin,” the study explained.“ETO-curcumin associated anti-inflammatory effects were particularly pronounced at higher doses.”Further findings revealed that anti-inflammatory proteins produced included IL-10 and IL-11 as well as FOXP3, which increased in number in the colon by ETO-curcumin.Study examines association between lifestyle patterns and BMI in early childhoodResults support obesity prevention efforts early in lifeDeakin University (Australia), April 26, 2021A new Australian study reveals that changes in lifestyle patterns were longitudinally associated with concurrent changes in body mass index (BMI) z scores, and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, maternal dietary patterns and television viewing time are significant determinants, according to a paper published online in Obesity, The Obesity Society's (TOS) flagship journal. 

- "The findings will inform early childhood obesity prevention intervention and policy, and will be of great interest to pediatricians, researchers, policymakers and the general public," said Miaobing Zheng of the Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition, School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Deakin University, in Geelong, Australia. 

- In the present study, the co-occurrence of stable healthy lifestyle patterns along with a concurrent normal BMI z score trajectory of one unit from 18 to 60 months in about half of the children provides new longitudinal evidence supporting that children with healthy lifestyles were more likely to concurrently have normal BMI z score development.Data of 439 children were used from the Melbourne Feeding Activity and Nutrition Trial (InFANT) program. 

- There is no doubt that children copy the behaviors observed in the presence of parents: healthy and unhealthy," said Liliana Aguayo, PhD, MPH, a childhood obesity expert, TOS member and research assistant professor from the Hubert Department of Global Health at Emory University in Atlanta, Ga. "Evidence from this study highlights the importance of early childhood as a critical period for development of obesity. 

- More research is needed to identify effective approaches to simultaneously address parent and child health behaviors." 

- Aguayo was not associated with the research.DDT exposure in grandmothers linked to obesity, earlier periods in granddaughtersYoung women today may face increased health risks linked to breast cancer due to effects from the banned toxic pesticide lasting over three generationsUniversity of California at Davis, April 16, 2021In the first study to report on the health effects of exposure to a toxic environmental chemical over three human generations, a new study has found that granddaughters whose grandmothers were exposed to the pesticide DDT have higher rates of obesity and earlier first menstrual periods. 

- This may increase the granddaughters' risk for breast cancer as well as high blood pressure, diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases.The research by the Public Health Institute's Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) and the University of California at Davis was published today in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. 

- Now our study shows for the first time in people that environmental chemicals like DDT may also pose health threats to our grandchildren," said Barbara Cohn, director of CHDS and senior author of the study. 

- "The Child Health and Development Studies is a unique project that has followed 20,000 pregnant women and their families for more than 60 years. 

- The study today focused on o,p'-DDT as it has previously been linked to breast cancer, obesity and other harmful health effects in daughters, and is believed to be the most sensitive biomarker for exposures before and immediately after birth. 

- Other prior studies have linked DDT exposure to birth defects, reduced fertility and an increased risk of diabetes.A commentary in the journal Reproductive Toxicology last year called CHDS "a national treasure that keeps on giving" and noted that "There are no other U.S. studies as well defined, sampled, and followed as the CHDS....The CHDS provides unique and essential value in understanding health effects of environmental exposures as they relate to life-stage sensitivity. 

- "Capsaicin analog could help treatment-resistant lung cancerSmall cell lung cancer cells exposed to synthetic analog of chili pepper compound responded better to chemotherapyMarshall University, April 27, 2021A new study found that non-pungent synthetic analog of capsaicin -- the compound that makes chili peppers hot -- made small cell lung cancer cells more responsive to treatment. 

- Small cell lung cancer is a very aggressive form of cancer with a low survival rate.Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is typically the first-line treatment for small cell lung cancer patients. 

- Patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer have very few treatment options. 

- "Five Therapeutic Properties of Medicinal MushroomsGreenMedInfo, April 25, 2021Mushrooms have recently gained popularity in culinary circles, but their far-reaching therapeutic properties should get your attention for a longer and healthier life.Although mushrooms have been part of the healer’s toolbox since ancient times, the medicinal power of mushrooms is gaining momentum in evidence-based journals.Medicinal mushrooms come in a wide variety and shapes such as white button, reishi, maitake, shiitake, oyster, cordyceps, cauliflower, tiger tail and lion’s mane, and most have health benefits that range from fighting cancer and boosting your immunity and memory to preventing diseases like diabetes and arthritis.1. 

- [ii]Polysaccharides from Cordyceps cicadae mushrooms inhibited the growth of cancer cells and induced cancer cell deaths showing its effectiveness as a low cost and safe treatment for cervical cancer. 

- [v]Cordyceps cicadae mushroom treatment prevented testicular damage and tumors caused by the chemotherapy drug cisplatin via inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation in rats. 

- [vi]In a lung cancer-induced study of mice, treatment with reishi mushrooms inhibited cell viability and mobility of lung cancer cells in vitro. 

- [vii] In a cell study of reishi mushroom extract, the treatment offered high antitumor and liver protection with low toxicity on human liver cancer cells.[viii]2. 

- ImmunomodulatoryIn a meta-analysis of 20 animal disease studies, grifola frondosa, or maitake mushroom, polysaccharide showed strong immune function by enhancing T cells, natural killer cells and macrophages in mice and increasing the secretion of two important immune factors, TNF-α and INF-γ. 

- [ix]In a clinical study of 105 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatments, a combination of reishi mushroom extract and geraniums improved immunity and fought the cancer and secondary infections that could have compromised treatment and health. 

- [x]In a study of 18 patients diagnosed with low and intermediate myelodysplastic syndrome, which can lead to leukemia if not managed well, maitake mushroom extract treatment of three milligrams (mg) twice a day for 12 weeks increased immunity, positively affecting neutrophil, monocyte and free radical production. 

- [xi]In a clinical study of asymptomatic children from 3 to 5 years old, treatment with beta glucans from reishi mushrooms showed increased immune system cells in the peripheral blood — signaling a strong defense against childhood infections. 

- Anti-inflammatoryCrohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. 

- Treatment with a triterpene compound from reishi mushrooms showed that the inflammatory cytokines were significantly inhibited in a study of children with Crohn’s disease. 

- In an Alzheimer’s disease model of rats, treatment with medicinal mushroom extracts delayed disease progression, improved learning and memory functions and stopped neural cell deaths and brain atrophy. 

- [xxi]Chaga mushrooms administered to mice successfully protected against Alzheimer’s disease by modulating oxidative stress, Nrf2 signaling and mitochondrial cell deaths while improving memory and cognition. 

- [xxii] Cordycepin from the Cordyceps sinensis mushroom alleviated Parkinson’s disease motor disorder symptoms by lowering oxidative stress and inflammation in vivo and in vitro. 

- [xxviii]Diabetic nephropathy, kidney disease caused by Type 2 diabetes, was studied in vitro with disease-induced rats and treatment with Cordyceps cicadae resulted in improved insulin resistance and glucose tolerance, suppressed inflammation and balanced gut microbiome thus stopping the diabetes-related progression of renal disease and tumors. 

- [xxix]In an animal study, maitake mushroom prevented the progression of kidney fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy rats, significantly decreased fasting blood glucose levels, reduced inflammatory cytokines and lowered renal fibrosis indexes indicating its effectiveness in the treatment or prevention of nephropathy. 

- [xxxi]Mushrooms and Their Medicinal PowersMedicinal mushrooms are widely researched and used as treatment in the prevention and progression of many diseases from cancer and asthma to diabetes and dementia. 

- The condition is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease in the U.S. and is also associated with a high risk of heart disease. 

- Luckily, PEITC is naturally present in many dietary sources, importantly watercress, broccoli, turnips and radish," said El-Sherbiny.Since the research was conducted in animal models, further studies will be needed to confirm the findings and understand how the results could translate to new treatments or dietary recommendations for people with diabetes.Eating probiotic foods helps improve bone health in womenKyung Hee University (South Korea), April 23, 2021A recent study by researchers at Kyung Hee University (KHU) in South Korea presents a good example of how powerful probiotics are and how they can be used for medicinal purposes. 

- Normally, good bacteria outnumber bad bacteria and keep them in check; but certain activities, such as frequent douching or unprotected sex, can disrupt the microbial balance in the vagina and promote the growth of bad bacteria.Osteoporosis, also called “porous bone,” is a disease characterized by either the loss of too much bone in the body, a decreased formation of bone, or both. 

- The probiotics also inhibited the activation of NF-kB, a transcription factor that increases the production of inflammatory cytokines, and TNF-a expression in the vagina and uterus of the female mice.The researchers also found that treatment with NK3 alone or in combination with NK49 alleviated ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis and obesity. 

- NK3 and/or NK49 treatment also reduced TNF-a expression and NF-kB activation in the colon and restored optimal gut microbiota composition.Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that the probiotics present in fermented foods like kimchi can alleviate BV and osteoporosis by reducing inflammation and regulating gut microbial composition.Chronic stress may reduce lifespan in wild baboons, according to new multi-decadal studyDuke University, April 21, 2021Female baboons may not have bills to pay or deadlines to meet, but their lives are extremely challenging. 

- These results, together with the lack of awareness that the participants presented about the visual impairment caused by smoking cannabis, indicate the need to carry out awareness-raising campaigns, as this visual deterioration can pose a danger when performing everyday tasks.Poor iodine levels in pregnancy poses risks to fetal intellectual developmentUniversity of South Australia, April 23, 2021A growing number of young Australian women are at increased risk of having children born with impaired neurological conditions, due to poor iodine intake.Dietary changes, including a growing trend towards the avoidance of bread and iodised salt, as well as a reduced intake of animal products containing iodine can contribute to low iodine levels.A small pilot study undertaken by the University of South Australia (UniSA) comparing iodine levels between 31 vegan/plant-based participants and 26 omnivores has flagged the potential health risk.Urine samples showed iodine readings of 44 ug/L in the plant-based group, compared to the meat eaters' 64 ug/L level. 

- Neither group came close to the World Health Organization's recommended 100 grams per liter.Participants from both groups who chose pink or Himalayan salt instead of iodised salt had severely deficient iodine levels, averaging 23 ug/L.The findings have been published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.While the study was undertaken in South Australia, it builds evidence on a 2017 US study (1) that found nearly two billion people worldwide were iodine deficient, resulting in 50 million experiencing clinical side effects.UniSA research dietitian Jane Whitbread says adequate iodine is essential for fetal intellectual development. 

- This reflects the inclusion of iron-rich soy products, wholemeal foods, legumes, and green leafy vegetables in their diet.The researchers recommended that both new salts and plant milks be fortified with iodine as well as a campaign to raise awareness about the importance of iodine in the diet, especially for women in their reproductive years.They also called for a larger study sample to determine iodine status of Australian women.Taking vitamin D could lower heart disease risk for people with dark skinRacial disparities in heart disease may be linked to vitamin D deficiencyPenn State University, April 26, 2021New research suggests a simple step could help millions of people reduce their risk of heart disease: make sure to get enough vitamin D. Elucidating linkages between skin pigmentation, vitamin D and indicators of cardiovascular health, the new study, combined with evidence from previous research, suggests vitamin D deficiency could contribute to the high rate of heart disease among African Americans. 

- "These findings may help to explain some of the differences that we see in the risk for developing blood vessel dysfunction, hypertension and overt cardiovascular disease between ethnic groups in the United States. 

- Although there are many factors that contribute to the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, vitamin D supplementation may provide a simple and cost-effective strategy to reduce those disparities. 

- Nitric oxide is important for blood vessel function, and reduced nitric oxide availability is thought to predispose an individual to the development of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. 

- "Our findings suggest that promoting adequate vitamin D status in young, otherwise healthy adults may improve nitric oxide availability and blood vessel function, and thereby serve as a prophylactic to reduce risk of future development of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. 

- According to the researchers, taking account of loneliness and social relationships should thus be an important part of comprehensive health care and disease prevention. 

- "It has been estimated, on the basis of studies carried out in recent years, that loneliness could be as significant a health risk as smoking or overweight. 

- Their health and mortality have been monitored on the basis of register data up until present days. 

- This association with the risk of cancer was observed regardless of age, socio-economic status, lifestyle, sleep quality, depression symptoms, body mass index, heart disease and their risk factors. 

- "Awareness of the health effects of loneliness is constantly increasing. 

- Therefore, it is important to examine, in more detail, the mechanisms by which loneliness causes adverse health effects. 

- "How exercise and the simple act of moving your body can improve mental healthUniversity of Toronto, April 26, 2021Whether running around a track or simply stretching in your living room, physical activity can go a long way toward making you happier.Catherine Sabiston, a professor in the University of Toronto's Faculty of Kinesiology & Physical Education, says the positive impact of exercise on mental health is well-documented. 

- "There is uncontested evidence that physical activity is conducive to mental health," she says.For example, Sabiston co-authored a study in the Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology that adolescents who consistently participated in team sports during high school reported lower depression levels in early adulthood.A Canada Research Chair in physical activity and mental health, Sabiston directs a lab that studies the connections between physical activity and mental health, developing and evaluating interventions to promote physical activity and mental wellness among people who are at risk of inactivity and mental health problems.The lab also runs a six-week program called MoveU.HappyU that provides customized coaching and training aimed at reducing the stress and anxiety of students in the lab through physical movement.She recently spoke with U of T News about why it's important to stay active during the pandemic—and how to feel good doing it.How closely connected are physical activity and mental health?Symptoms of mental illness such as anxiety and depression can impede physical activity and vice versa. 

- Many of the symptoms tied to mental illness are also barriers to physical activity.On the flip side, there is uncontested evidence that physical activity is conducive to mental health. 

- It holds its own weight in comparison to all other forms of treatment for mental illness, including psychotherapy and even medication.Physical activity is a potential adjunct to any other form of preventative or treatment-focused therapy.How exactly does exercise lift our mood?There are a number of mechanisms at play, including physical activity effects that are tied to our brain activity and brain chemistry. 

- So, physical activity brings us closer to that core level of movement that human bodies are meant to be.Moreover, physical activity can mimic mental health symptoms such as anxiety. 

- When you exercise, you may sweat or feel your heart racing. 

- That mimics the feeling of panic, so by engaging in exercise, you are producing a similar physical effect that can make you more accustomed to those symptoms. 

- Exercise also provides you with an opportunity, whether for two minutes or 20, to break away from your usual routines or worries. 

- In fact, feelings of mastery and accomplishment are also specific ways that physical activity impacts mental health. 

- Small goals and activities inherent to physical activity offer plenty of opportunities for positive feedback, feeling successful and achieving, which helps stave off symptoms of mental illness.Finally, physical activity is something you can partake in outdoors, which has a potentiating effect on mental health. 

- Some students who had never spoken to their families about their mental health struggles are now actually having their whole families join in on the physical activities.The physical activity you are doing should be something that you enjoy. 

- Anti-aging compound improves muscle glucose metabolism in peopleWashington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, April 25, 2021A natural compound previously demonstrated to counteract aspects of aging and improve metabolic health in mice has clinically relevant effects in people, according to new research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.A small clinical trial of postmenopausal women with prediabetes shows that the compound NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) improved the ability of insulin to increase glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, which often is abnormal in people with obesity, prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes. 

- However, the treatment did not lower blood glucose or blood pressure, improve blood lipid profile, increase insulin sensitivity in the liver, reduce fat in the liver or decrease circulating markers of inflammation as seen in mice.The study, published online April 22 in the journal Science, is the first randomized clinical trial to look at the metabolic effects of NMN administration in people.Among the women in the study, 13 received 250 mg of NMN orally every day for 10 weeks, and 12 were given an inactive placebo every day over the same period. 

- "Although our study shows a beneficial effect of NMN in skeletal muscle, it is premature to make any clinical recommendations based on the results from our study," said senior investigator Samuel Klein, MD, the William H. Danforth Professor of Medicine and Nutritional Science and director of the Center for Human Nutrition. 

- "Normally, when a treatment improves insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, as is observed with weight loss or some diabetes medications, there also are related improvements in other markers of metabolic health, which we did not detect in our study participants. 

- Klein and Imai are continuing to evaluate NMN in another trial involving men as well as women.High dose of vitamin D fails to improve condition of moderate to severe COVID-19 patientsUniversity of São Paulo's Medical School (Brazil), April 26, 2021Can a high dose of vitamin D administered on admission to hospital improve the condition of patients with moderate or severe COVID-19? 

- The answer is no, according to a Brazilian study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).The article reports a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the kind of study considered the gold standard to evaluate drug efficacy. 

- It was conducted with FAPESP's support by researchers at the University of São Paulo's Medical School (FM-USP), who recruited 240 patients treated at Hospital das Clínicas (HC), the hospitalcomplex run by FM-USP, and the Ibirapuera field hospital in São Paulo City in June-August 2020. 

- All participants were treated according to the standard protocol for hospital treatment of the disease, which includes administration of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs.The main purpose was to see if acute supplementation would affect the length of hospital stay for these patients, but the researchers also wanted to find out whether it would mitigate the risks of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), intubation and death.No significant difference between the groups was observed for any of these clinical outcomes. 

- "So far we can say there's no indication to administer vitamin D to patients who come to the hospital with severe COVID-19," she said.For Bruno Gualano, a researcher at FM-USP and penultimate author of the article, the findings show that at least for now there is no "silver bullet" for the treatment of COVID-19. 

- "But that doesn't mean continuous use of vitamin D can't have beneficial effects of some kind," he said.Ideal dosePereira is currently leading a study at FM-USP to find out whether subjects with sufficient circulating levels of vitamin D combat infection by SARS-CoV-2 better than those with insufficient levels of the nutrient.The ideal level of vitamin D in the blood and the daily supplementation dose vary according to age and overall health, she explained. 

- The review was carried out by researchers at the universities of Hong Kong and Eastern Finland and published in Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition.Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can interfere with the body's hormonal system, also called the endocrine system, and are widely present in the environment. 

- "Grape seed extract may protect gut from inflammation: StudyUniversitat Rovira i Virgili (Spain), April 25, 2021Proanthocyanidin-rich grape seed extracts may protect the intestines from the deleterious effects of a high-fat/high-carbohydrate diet, according to data from a rat study.A high-fat/high-carbohydrate diet or Western diet has been reported to produce changes in the intestine, explained researchers from the Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona, Spain.“Concretely, several recent studies have provided compelling new evidence to suggest that changes in the epithelial barrier function and intestinal inflammation are associated with and could even lead to altered regulation of body weight and glucose homeostasis,” they added.“The main consequence of the gut barrier dysfunction has been proposed to be the entry of toxins from the intestinal lumen, which can trigger local inflammation or gain access to the circulation and induce systemic inflammation through cytokine release.”Their new research indicated that a grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) may protect the gut from such harmful effects.Study detailsData published in Molecular Nutrition and Food Research reveals that supplementing the diet of lab rats with medium or high-dose proanthocyanidins had beneficial impacts on intestinal inflammation, oxidative stress, and barrier function. 

- Then, given the importance of having a healthy barrier function, dietary interventions that can modulate the intestinal permeability might afford an effective tool for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases associated with obesity.”The researchers concluded: “Our findings indicate that orally administered GSPE modulates the intestinal inflammation, oxidative stress, and possibly the barrier function. 

- Based on these findings, our data suggest that nutritional and/or therapeutic interventions focused on gut health and modulation of the intestinal permeability should be extensively explored in the context of obesity.”Antidepressant use in pregnancy tied to affective disorders in offspring; no causal linkMount Sinai Hospital, April 12, 2021Major depressive disorder is highly prevalent, with one in five people experiencing an episode at some point in their life, and is almost twice as common in women than in men. 

- Antidepressants are usually given as a first-line treatment, including during pregnancy, either to prevent the recurrence of depression, or as acute treatment in newly depressed patients. 

- So, while other long-term effects of intrauterine exposure to antidepressants remain to be investigated, our work supports antidepressant continuation for women with severe symptoms or a high risk of relapse because untreated psychiatric illness during pregnancy can have negative consequences on the health and development of the child. 

- Women and their health care providers should carefully weigh all of the treatment options and jointly decide on the best course of action. 

- "Staying Active Can Fight Declines in Cognitive EngagementNorth Carolina State University, April 22, 2021Preserving physical and mental health helps older adults experiencing cognitive impairment stave off declines in cognitive engagement, a new study suggests“We found that declines in physical and mental health were associated with more pronounced cognitive disengagement,” says Shevaun Neupert, professor of psychology at North Carolina State University and corresponding author of the study published in Entropy.“The impact of declines in physical health was particularly pronounced for study participants who had more advanced cognitive impairment to begin with.”There’s a lot of research showing that cognitive engagement can help older adults maintain cognitive health. 

- On each visit, researchers collected data on the physical and mental health of the study participants and performed a battery of tests designed to assess cognitive ability. 

- Specifically, blood pressure rises as more blood is pumped to the brain when participants work harder at these tasks.Broadly speaking, the researchers found that if a participant’s cognitive ability, physical health, or mental health declined over the course of the six month study period, that participant became less cognitively engaged as the tasks became harder.“Normally, you’d expect more engagement as the tasks became harder, but we found that some people essentially stopped trying,” says coauthor Claire Growney, a postdoctoral researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.“The findings highlight the fact that well-being is holistic; physical health, mental health, and cognitive function can influence each other,” says coauthor Xianghe Zhu, a recent PhD graduate of NC State.“In practical terms, it suggests that it may be particularly important for people to focus on mental and physical well-being during the early stages of cognitive decline,” Growney says. 

- “Or, at the very least, don’t become so focused on addressing cognitive challenges that you ignore physical health, or create anxiety or emotional distress for yourself that leads to mental health problems.”“Future research will be needed to determine how beneficial it might be for people to take part in cognitively engaging activities once they’ve started experiencing cognitive decline,” Neupert says.“But we already know that there is an element of ‘use it or lose it’ to cognitive function in healthy adults. 

- And while it’s understandable for people to want to avoid tasks that are difficult or challenging, it’s really important to continue challenging ourselves to take part in difficult cognitive activities.”
To Lower Cancer Risks, Eat More MushroomsEating more mushrooms is associated with lower risk of cancer, according to a new studyPenn State University, April 23, 2021The systematic review and meta-analysis published in Advances in Nutrition examines 17 cancer studies from 1966 to 2020. 

- Analyzing data from more than 19,500 cancer patients, researchers explore the relationship between mushroom consumption and cancer risk.Mushrooms are rich in vitamins, nutrients, and antioxidants. 

- Moving forward, this research could be helpful in further exploring the protective effects that mushrooms have and helping to establish healthier diets that prevent cancer.“Overall, these findings provide important evidence for the protective effects of mushrooms against cancer,” says coauthor John Richie, a Penn State Cancer Institute researcher and professor of public health sciences and pharmacology. 

- )Iron deficiency is common in women of childbearing age and is a global health problem. 

- Data from 815 older people (63% women) who participated in a community-based health check survey (Tarumizu Study) were analyzed.”The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Osaka Prefecture University, “Prefrailty were defined using five parameters (exhaustion, slowness, weakness, low physical activity, and weight loss). 

- Nutrition intake was estimated from a validated brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire. 

- Vitamins K, B1, B2, folic acid, pantothenic acid, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and copper intake was significantly lower in the prefrailty group. 

- Protein intake might be sufficient to prevent prefrailty in the present study.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “We propose magnesium to be an important micronutrient that prevents prefrailty in community-dwelling older Japanese women.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Gardens and green space linked to better mental health during pandemic, study showsCardiff University (UK), April 19, 2021People with green space on their doorstep or access to a private garden reported better health and wellbeing during and after the first lockdown in the UK, according to a new study.Researchers from Cardiff University and Cardiff Metropolitan University have shown that people with a garden and a park nearby were more likely to say they were feeling calm, peaceful and had a lot of energy as compared to those with no access to a garden or living further away from a green space.Official figures show that around one in eight households in Great Britain had no access to a private or shared garden during the coronavirus pandemic, and that just a quarter of people in Great Britain live within a five-minute walk of a public park.The researchers say the study is the first to assess the impact of green space during the pandemic, and that it highlights the huge benefits for both physical and mental health and making our communities more resilient.In the study, published in the journal Landscape & Urban Planning, the researchers surveyed 5,556 people about their home and neighborhood, as well as their perceived mental health and wellbeing, at two intervals—the first in March/April 2020 during the first peak of the pandemic and again in June/July 2020 after the first peak had subsided.For the first 2-3 months of the lockdown, individuals were only permitted to leave their home for essential travel, such as food shopping, and for outdoor exercise once a day.The survey formed part of the COVID-19 Public Experiences (COPE) study, with most participants recruited through Health Wise Wales (HWW), an existing national longitudinal study funded by the Welsh Government.Among a wide-range of topics, participants were specifically asked if they felt calm and peaceful and had a lot of energy, or if they felt downhearted and blue, with answers provided on a scale of zero to five. 

- Similarly, the participants were asked how they would rate their health in general from one to five.The participants were also asked about their access to a private garden and how far they lived from the nearest green space, such as a park, woodland or playing field.Subjective wellbeing was shown to be significantly higher in the post-peak period when lockdown restrictions were being eased than in the first peak of the pandemic when lockdown restrictions came into force in the UK.People living a five-to-10-minute walk or more than a 10-minute walk away from public green space had lower levels of subjective wellbeing than those living less than a five-minute walk away, whilst those with access to a private garden had higher levels of subjective wellbeing than those without a private garden.The results further show that, during the first peak of the pandemic, access to green space was particularly important for households without private gardens. 

- Being close to a public green space or private garden had a greater health protective effect for those who did not have access to a private garden.Though a statistically significant link was found between access to a private gardenand the wellbeing of men, no evidence was found for specific groups benefitting more than others. 

- "What this shows is that both gardens and parks have been essential for people's health and wellbeing during the pandemic, especially when the toughest restrictions were in place," said lead author of the study Professor Wouter Poortinga, from Cardiff University's Welsh School of Architecture and School of Psychology. 

- This has made spending time in private gardens and public green spaces vital to reducing the impact of the pandemic on people's health and wellbeing. 

- Clinical visits all took place at one center, with participants being selected from different outpatient clinics in the city of Pune, India, who sought treatment for mild cognitive impairment.To be included in the study, participants had to be aged 35 or older, have subjective sumptoms of memory impairment, a previous diagnosis of early dementia or a score a certain amount in a mini-mental state examination, and the ability and willingness to provide informed consent.Excluded from the study are participants with severe memory impairment, known neuropsychiatric conditions, persistent endocrine disorders, and chronic medical conditions such as uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes mellitus.Throughout the study period, other than ashwagandha root extract for the supplement group, the use of nootropic agents or anticholinesterase drugs were prohibited.Measuring protocols and outcomesParticipants were assessed using standardized tests for several memory types: Immediate memory (the ability to remember a small amount of information over a few seconds), general memory (delayed recall of word lists, geometric designs, text, faces), working memory (capacity to store information received from eyes, ears, and other sense organs in the immediate term).They were also assessed for visuospatial processing and response, executive function, attention, and speed of information processing.Study outcomes revealed that the ashwagandha group fared significantly better than baseline and the placebo group participants in terms of immediate and general memory test scores. 

- There was also a great uptick in executive function, sustained attention, and information-processing speed.According to the researchers, this may be from ashwagandha’s sedative properties, which “may be indirectly involved in improving memory and cognition in human subjects, as stress, anxiety, and sleep disorders can affect normal cognitive function,” they wrote.The small sample size was one drawback of the study, and the researchers recommend a follow-up that is longer and with a larger sample to “confirm the promising results of this study.”Foods associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in middle-ageOxford University, April 23, 2021Two common dietary patterns identified in British adults, which include high intakes of chocolate and confectionary, may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in middle-age, according to a study published in the open access journal BMC Medicine.Carmen Piernas, the corresponding author said: "Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of death and disability in the UK and poor diet is a major contributor to this. 

- Our findings help identify specific foods and beverages that are commonly eaten in Britain and that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. 

- "Researchers from the University of Oxford, UK identified two diets that were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in middle-age in Britain. 

- In this group, individuals who were younger than 60 years old or living with overweight or obesity had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than individuals who were older than 60 years or not living with overweight or obesity.Those whose diet was high in sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juice and preserves were found to have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality, even though they also tended to be physically active and less likely to be current smokers or living with obesity, hypertension, diabetes or high cholesterol, than those who did not eat this diet. 

- Women, individuals who were younger than 60 years old or who lived with obesity in particular had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, if they consumed a diet high in these foods.To examine the effects of diet on the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, the authors analysed data collected from 116,806 adults from England, Scotland and Wales who were recruited to the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010. 

- The incidence of cardiovascular disease and mortality was calculated using hospital admission and death registry records until 2017 and 2020, respectively.The authors caution that the observational nature of the study does not allow for conclusions about a causal relationship between diet, cardiovascular disease and mortality. 

- Future research could investigate the potential reasons for the associations between the two diets investigated in this study and cardiovascular disease and mortality.Carmen Piernas said: "Our research suggests that eating less chocolate, confectionery, butter, low-fibre bread, sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juice, table sugar and preserves could be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease or death during middle-age. 

- This is consistent with previous research which has suggested that eating foods that contain less sugar and fewer calories may be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. 

- The findings of this study could be used to create food-based dietary advice that could help people eat more healthily and reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease."

- Vitamin A derivative selectively kills liver cancer stem cellsRIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Science (Japan), April 23, 2021Acyclic retinoid, an artificial compound derived from vitamin A, has been found to prevent the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer. 

- However, scientists were not sure exactly why it worked.To find clues, a research group led by Soichi Kojima of the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Science looked at the transcriptome of cells that had been exposed to acyclic retinoid, and found that compared to control untreated cells, they had low expression of MYCN, a gene that is often expressed in tumors and is correlated with poor prognosis. 

- "A phase 3 clinical trial of acyclic retinoid (also called Peretinoin), is currently underway in Korea, Taiwan and Singapore to test the drug's ability to prevent HCC recurrence.Light up your mind: A novel light-based treatment for neurodegenerative diseasesResearchers review growing knowledge on the methods and applications of light therapy in treating neurodegenerative diseasesSoochow University (China), April 2021A lot about the human brain and its intricacies continues to remain a mystery. 

- However, while the current treatments offer temporary symptomatic relief and slow down the course of the disease, they do not completely cure the condition and are often accompanied by a myriad of side effects that can impair normal daily functions of the patient.Light stimulation has been proposed as a promising therapeutic alternative for treating various ND like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), cognitive and sleep disorders. 

- While neurologists worldwide have begun testing its use in clinical practice, less remains understood about the mechanisms behind how light affects neurological function.Thus, in a review article now published in Chinese Medical Journal, researchers from China comprehensively summarize the growing knowledge on the mechanism of action, effectiveness, and clinical applications of LT in the treatment of ND. 

- In case of AD, a progressive dementia, sleep disturbance has been associated with an increased expression of biomarkers that promote disease progression. 

- Overall, LT offers a safe and cost-effective alternative for treatment of ND. 

- The study, led by Professor Efrat Monsonego-Ornan and Dr. Janna Zaretsky from the Department of Biochemistry, Food Science and Nutrition at the University's Faculty of Agriculture, was published in the journal Bone Research and serves as the first comprehensive study of the effect of widely-available food products on skeleton development.Ultra-processed foods--aka, junk food--are food items products that undergo several stages of processing and contain non-dietary ingredients.

- "Results From The World's Largest Wellbeing Study Are In: Here's What We KnowSouth Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, April 20, 2021For decades, researchers have known that positive mental wellbeing seems to deliver significant improvements in physical health, development, and lifespan – which suggests looking after your mind and mental state is one of the most effective ways to care for the rest of your body as well.But what's the best way to actually promote personal mental wellbeing? 

- "During stressful and uncertain periods in our lives, pro-actively working on our mental health is crucial to help mitigate the risk of mental and physical illness," says mental health researcher Joep Van Agteren from the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI). 

- "In itself that might seem obvious, but as the researchers point out, up until now our awareness of psychological interventions' relative efficacy has been obstructed, given much research treats mental wellbeing and mental illness as different things, although they are overlapping concepts in some ways.Here, the researchers tried to take a broader view, looking at how a wide range of different types of psychological intervention can benefit mental wellbeing, irrespective of any particular theoretical foundation in psychology.Amongst the many forms of interventions included, two in particular stood out for their consistent associations with positive findings across trial cohorts: mindfulness-based interventions, and multi-component PPIs (positive psychological interventions), which package together a range of treatment methods and activities designed to cultivate positive feelings, behaviors, and thinking patterns.To a lesser extent, other interventions also appeared to deliver benefits, including acceptance and commitment therapy-based interventions, cognitive therapy, singular PPIs, and interventions focusing on reminiscence.While the effect sizes of these interventions are often moderate, the analysis here suggests they are linked with positive improvements in wellbeing in both clinical and non-clinical populations – but there's no quick fix, the researchers emphasize. 

- "Just trying something once or twice isn't enough to have a measurable impact," says co-author Matthew Iasiello, a project coordinator at SAHMRI's Mental Health and Wellbeing program. 

- "While the review did not find a clear linear dose-response effect, with more exposure leading simply to better treatment outcomes, the results do indicate that more intense interventions seem to lead to more pronounced changes. 

- "Another insight by the researchers is that many kinds of psychological interventions can be done safely in volunteer groups or via online platforms, not requiring clinical appointments with professionals such as psychologists.With mental illness projected to become the largest contributor to disease by 2030, electing to look after yourself with these sorts of activities might not only benefit your own mental wellbeing and health – but the health of the health system too. 

- "It is therefore potentially a cost-effective addition to current referral pathways and treatment methods," says clinical psychologist Michael Kyrios from Flinders University. 

- "We need to take everyone's wellbeing seriously and ensure we're taking the necessary steps to improve mental and physical health so we can prevent future complications for ourselves and keep healthcare costs down. 

- "The findings are reported in Nature Human Behaviour.The Stuff Beer Cans are Made from is Linked to Alzheimer's DiseaseKeele University (UK), April 15, 2021There appears to be a troubling link between aluminum in the brain and the early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease, according to a new study.Researchers have known for years that aluminum has something to do with Alzheimer’s, but now Keele University scientists have discovered that the metal pops up at the same places in the brain as the tangles of tau protein that appear in the early stages of the disease, according to research published last month in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports. 

- But as people age, their kidneys may lose the ability to filter it out of the brain ­— potentially leading to the Alzheimer’s ties uncovered in the new study.“Aluminum accumulation has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease for nearly half a century,” Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease editor-in-chief George Perry said in the release, “but it is the meticulously specific studies of Drs. 

- Mold and Exley that are defining the exact molecular interaction of aluminum and other multivalent metals that may be critical to formation of the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease.”Drought-resistant cactus pear could become a sustainable food and fuel source, new research showsUniversity of Nevada, April 16, 2021Cactus pears could become a sustainable source of food and fuel in places in need of these two resources. 

- The researchers said CAM plants like prickly pear could make a huge contribution to sustainable biogas production this way.Yeast in kefir drink combats disease-causing bacteriaBen-Gurion University (Israel), April 17, 2021People may have been producing and drinking kefir, a fermented milk drink that originated in Tibet and the North Caucasus, for thousands of years.People can make the sour, slightly effervescent brew by infusing milk with kefir grains, which are a starchy matrix containing a symbiotic community of lactic acid bacteria, acetic bacteria, and yeasts.The drink has many reputed health benefits, which include lowering cholesterol, reducing inflammation, and exerting an antioxidant effect.In common with other probiotics, kefir also has antimicrobial properties. 

- However, scientists were unsure exactly how it inhibits the growth of disease-causing bacteria.Researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) in Be’er Sheva, Israel, have now discovered that a type of yeast in kefir called Kluyveromyces marxianus secretes a molecule that disrupts bacterial communication.Scientists already knew that plants and algae produce this substance, called tryptophol acetate, but this is the first time that they have found a yeast that makes it.They discovered that tryptophol acetate interferes with “quorum sensing” — a form of microbial communication — in several disease-causing bacteria.In quorum sensingTrusted Source, bacteria release signaling molecules into their surroundings. 

- When the molecules reach a particular concentration, they trigger changes in the expression of genes in bacteria of the same species.These changes allow disease-causing bacteria to coordinate their activity according to their numbers. 

- This coordination is necessary for some bacteria to defend themselves or attack their hosts.In some cases, when they reach a certain density, the microbes may come together to form a slimy, protective coating, or “biofilm,” on a surface.Disease-causing bacteriaIn lab cultures, the researchers found that tryptophol acetate had an inhibitory effect over quorum sensing in several disease-causing bacteria, including some Gram-negativeTrusted Source bacteria.Some of the tested species were:Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which causes pneumonia when it infects the lungs.S. 

- cholerae, which causes cholera.The research, which Ph.D. student Orit Malka led, appears in the journal BMC Microbiome.“These results are notable, since this is the first demonstration that virulence of human pathogenic bacteria can be mitigated by molecules secreted in probiotic milk products, such as yogurt or kefir,” says senior author Prof. Raz Jelinek.The scientists focused in particular on the effect of tryptophol acetate on V. cholerae.They found that the substance blocked quorum sensing in this bacteria and reduced its virulence.It did this by changing the expression of bacterial genes that control quorum sensing.The researchers write that this kind of interference in bacterial communication may be commonplace in complex environments where many different microorganisms live together, such as in probiotic food or the human gut.Living near pesticide-treated farms raises risk of childhood brain tumorsCedars-Sinai Medical Center, April 15, 2021Pregnant women living within 2.5 miles of agricultural lands treated with pesticides have a greater risk of their children developing central nervous system (CNS) tumors, according to a recent study.Published on Wednesday, March 31, in the Environmental Research journal, the study also revealed that the pregnant women did not have to be working in agriculture or in close contact with pesticides for health-harming exposures to occur.Study co-author Christina Lombardi, a public health researcher at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said there are large numbers of pregnant women and children living close to pesticide-treated farmlands. 

- Both mothers and children could experience adverse health effects from their proximity to those farmlands.The study is not the first to show that pesticide use poses a threat to pregnant women and their children. 

- Angiotensin II elevates blood pressure by constricting the blood vessels; hence, chemicals that can inhibit the activity of ACE, which is responsible for the production of angiotensin II, are used for the treatment of hypertension. 

- "The findings suggest that omega-3 supplementation is one relatively simple change people could make that could have a positive effect at breaking the chain between stress and negative health effects," said Annelise Madison, lead author of the paper and a graduate student in clinical psychology at Ohio State.The research is published today (Monday, April 19, 2021) in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.Madison works in the lab of Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, professor of psychiatry and psychology and director of the Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research at Ohio State. 

- Telomeres' tendency to shorten in many types of cells is associated with age-related diseases, especially heart disease, and early mortality.In the initial study, researchers were monitoring changes to telomere length in white blood cells known as lymphocytes. 

- Meeting minimum exercise guidelines won't cut it5 hours of moderate activity a week may be required to avoid midlife hypertension, UCSF-led study showsUniversity of California at San Francisco, April 15, 2021Young adults must step up their exercise routines to reduce their chances of developing high blood pressure or hypertension - a condition that may lead to heart attack and stroke, as well as dementia in later life.Current guidelines indicate that adults should have a minimum of two-and-a-half hours of moderate intensity exercise each week, but a new study led by UCSF Benioff Children's Hospitals reveals that boosting exercise to as much as five hours a week may protect against hypertension in midlife - particularly if it is sustained in one's thirties, forties and fifties.In the study publishing in American Journal of Preventive Medicine on April 15, researchers followed approximately 5,000 adults ages 18 to 30 for 30 years. 

- The participants were asked about their exercise habits, medical history, smoking status and alcohol use. 

- But by the time Black men reached age 60, exercise intake had slumped from a peak of approximately 560 exercise units to around 300 units, the equivalent to the minimum of two-and-a-half hours a week of moderate intensity exercise recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 

- This was substantially less exercise than White men (approximately 430 units) and slightly more than White women (approximately 320 units). 

- Of the four groups, Black women had the least exercise throughout the study period and saw declines over time to approximately 200 units. 

- For White women, physical activity hovered around 380 exercise units, dipping in their thirties and remaining constant to age 60.Rates of hypertension mirrored this declining physical activity. 

- "Results from randomized controlled trials and observational studies have shown that exercise lowers blood pressure, suggesting that it may be important to focus on exercise as a way to lower blood pressure in all adults as they approach middle age," said senior author Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, MD, PhD, of the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. 

- "More Exercise from Youth to Midlife Offers Best Protection Against HypertensionWhen researchers looked at the 17.9 percent of participants who had moderate exercise for at least five hours a week during early adulthood - double the recommended minimum - they found that the likelihood of developing hypertension was 18 percent lower than for those who exercised less than five hours a week. 

- The likelihood was even lower for the 11.7 percent of participants who maintained their exercise habits until age 60.Patients should be asked about physical activity in the same way as they are routinely checked for blood pressure, glucose and lipid profiles, obesity and smoking, Nagata said, and intervention programs should be held at schools, colleges, churches, workplaces and community organizations. 

- "Study finds association between periodontal disease and low intake of minerals, vitamins and dietary fiber in young adult womenTokyo Medical and Dental University, April 12, 2021According to news reporting out of Tokyo, Japan, research stated, “Dietary habits of middle-aged and elderly individuals affected by periodontal disease (PD) differ from those who are unaffected by it, according to previous reports. 

- However, in young adults, there are only a few reports that show a correlation between nutrient/food intake and PD.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), “Moreover, no report till date has assessed the correlation between dietary habits and PD using a self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ). 

- The PD group had a significantly lower nutrient intake of minerals, fat-soluble vitamins, water-soluble vitamins, and dietary fiber than the non-PD group. 

- The PD group consumed significantly lesser amounts of hard foods than the non-PD group.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Young adult women who were evaluated for PD by a screening test had a significantly lower nutrient/food intake than those without a PD.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Just 2 days of increased sugar intake can harm your gut health, warn researchersUniversity of Alberta, April 16, 2021Researchers from the University of Alberta in Canada found that short-term increases in sugar intake can increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. 

- Their finding, which was published in Scientific Reports, is a reminder that eating healthy must be sustained in order to keep your gut in good shape.“Surprisingly, our study shows that short-term sugar consumption can really have a detrimental impact, and so this idea that it’s OK to eat well all week and indulge in junk food on the weekend is flawed,” said Karen Madsen, one of the study researchers.Increased sugar intake is bad for the gutPrevious studies have shown that diets can affect your susceptibility to disease. 

- Western diets, for example, have been implicated in the development of inflammatory bowel disease. 

- But it’s still unclear when a poor diet begins to take a toll on your health, much less how it does so.To investigate, the researchers placed adult mice on a chow diet or a high-sugar diet and treated them with dextran sodium sulfate to induce ulcerative colitis, one of the major forms of inflammatory bowel disease. 

- Disease severity was assessed daily.After two days, the mice on the high-sugar diet were at great risk of developing colitis. 

- Their immune response also weakened while their gut permeability increased, allowing more bacteria and toxins to enter their bloodstream.“We wanted to know how long it takes before a change in diet translates into an impact on health. 

- Having these supplements as an option will be great for people struggling to change their bad eating habits.“People want to eat what they want to eat, so short-chain fatty acids could possibly be used as supplements to help protect people against the detrimental effects of sugar on inflammatory bowel disease,” said Madsen.Rose water is an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory remedy for skin infectionsTeikyo University (Japan), April 15, 2021Rosa damascena, commonly known as Damask rose, is one of the most important and medicinally useful members of the Rosaceae (rose) family. 

- It is usually obtained by steam distilling Damask rose petals and taking the hydrosol portion of the rose petal distillate.In different parts of the world, rose water, rose oil and a decoction made of Damask rose roots are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various ailments, such as abdominal and chest pain, digestive problems and inflammation, especially of the neck. 

- To evaluate its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, the researchers tested Damask rose water against C. albicans and MRSA and assessed its effects on the function of neutrophils, which are white blood cells that serve as key regulators of inflammatory reactions.The researchers reported that Damask rose water (2.2. percent solution) inhibited the mycelial growth of C. albicans and reduced the viability of MRSA within an hour of treatment. 

- Damask rose water (five to 15 percent) also suppressed the activation of neutrophils induced by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial toxin; tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), a cell-signaling protein produced by immune cells; and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), a macrophage activator.Additionally, Damask rose water reduced LPS- and TNF-a-induced cell surface expression of the adhesion-related molecule, cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b), which is rapidly elevated by the activation of neutrophils. 

- Candidate in Haeryfar's lab.One of the important implications of this work is that innate-like T cells are currently being investigated for cancer immunotherapy treatment. 

- The research is presented at ESC Preventive Cardiology 2021, an online scientific congress of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).1"Previous studies have shown links between greater red meat consumption and increased risk of heart attacks or dying from heart disease," said study author Dr. Zahra Raisi-Estabragh of Queen Mary University of London, UK.2,3 "For the first time, we examined the relationships between meat consumption and imaging measures of heart health. 

- This may help us to understand the mechanisms underlying the previously observed connections with cardiovascular disease. 

- Second, novel CMR radiomics used in research to extract detailed information from heart images such as shape and texture (which indicates health of the heart muscle). 

- Third, elasticity of the blood vessels (stretchy arteries are healthier).The analysis was adjusted for other factors that might influence the relationship including age, sex, deprivation, education, smoking, alcohol, exercise, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and body mass index (BMI) as a measure of obesity.The researchers found that greater intake of red and processed meat was associated with worse imaging measures of heart health, across all measures studied. 

- Specifically, individuals with higher meat intake had smaller ventricles, poorer heart function, and stiffer arteries - all markers of worse cardiovascular health.As a comparison, the researchers also tested the relationships between heart imaging measures and intake of oily fish, which has previously been linked with better heart health. 

- Raisi-Estabragh said: "The findings support prior observations linking red and processed meat consumption with heart disease and provide unique insights into links with heart and vascular structure and function. 

- "The associations between imaging measures of heart health and meat intake were only partially explained by high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity. 

- "It has been suggested that these factors could be the reason for the observed relationship between meat and heart disease," said Dr. Raisi-Estabragh. 

- "For example, it is possible that greater red meat intake leads to raised blood cholesterol and this in turn causes heart disease. 

- Our study suggests that these four factors do play a role in the links between meat intake and heart health, but they are not the full story. 

- But she said: "There is some evidence that red meat alters the gut microbiome, leading to higher levels of certain metabolites in the blood, which have in turn been linked to greater risk of heart disease."Dr. 

- But in general, it seems sensible to limit intake of red and processed meat for heart health reasons. 

- "More Fruits and Veggies Improves Sleep for Young AdultsUniversity of Michigan, April 15, 2021Eating more fruits and vegetables can help young adults, especially young women, sleep better, a new study showsYoung adults who reported eating less than five servings of fruits and vegetables per day reported a high prevalence of chronic insomnia symptoms, with over one-third reporting difficulties with falling asleep or maintaining sleep at least three times per week for three months or longer.Women who increased their fruit and vegetable intake by three or more servings over a three-month period were more than twice as likely to experience an improvement in these insomnia symptoms, according to the study in the Sleep Health Journal.“We were very excited to see that a fairly simple dietary intervention, such as encouraging an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, could make such an impact on sleep,” says lead author Erica Jansen, research assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health.“We know from other literature that improving sleep improves overall quality of life and many other health outcomes, so the benefits likely extend beyond the sleep changes.”Jansen and senior author Gwen Alexander, a researcher in the public health sciences department at Henry Ford Health System, and colleagues analyzed data of more than 1,400 participants compiled by Detroit-based Henry Ford and the more rural Geisinger Health System headquartered in Danville, Pennsylvania.“From my health educator perspective, our study shows a link between dietary choices and improved sleep for young people who wish to improve their overall health and well-being,” Alexander says.“Our study was unique in that it investigated an understudied population of generally healthy young adults. 

- Future research designed for this population has great potential to lead to better health habits.”Eligible young adults included those ages 21-30, who received any medical care at the centers and who reported eating less than five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. 

- The participants were not told to change anything about their sleep habits.”The researchers hope the findings will be incorporated into other sleep hygiene principles, which include things like maintaining a consistent bedtime and rise time, eliminating screens prior to going to bed, sleeping in a dark, cool environment, and not drinking caffeine or alcohol before bed.Additional coauthors are from the University of South Carolina School of Medicine and the Henry Ford Health System.Multivits, omega-3, probiotics, vitamin D may lessen risk of positive COVID-19 testBritish Medical Journal, April 20, 2021Taking multivitamins, omega-3, probiotics or vitamin D supplements may lessen the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 infection—at least among women—indicates a large population study, published online in the journal BMJ Nutrition Prevention & Health.But taking any of vitamin C, zinc, or garlic supplements wasn't associated with a lower risk of testing positive for the virus, the findings show.There has been plenty of celebrity endorsement of the use of dietary supplements to both ward off and treat COVID-19 infection since the start of the pandemic, note the researchers.In the UK alone, market share rose by 19.5% in the period leading up to the first national 'lockdown' on March 23 last year, with sales of vitamin C rising by 110% and those of multivits by 93%.Similarly, zinc supplement sales rose by 415% in the first week of March, at the height of COVID-19 fears in the U.S..Dietary supplements can help to support a healthy immune system, but whether specific supplements might be associated with a lower risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 isn't known.In a bid to plug this knowledge gap, the researchers drew on adult users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app to see if regular supplement users were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2.The app was launched in the UK, the US, and Sweden in March 2020 to capture self-reported information on the evolution of the pandemic.Initially, it recorded the location, age and core health risk factors of its users. 

- "But to date, there is little convincing evidence that taking nutritional supplements has any therapeutic value beyond maintaining the body's normal immune response," comments Professor Sumantra Ray, Executive Director, NNEdPro Global Centre for Nutrition and Health, which co-owns the journal. 

- This is still an emerging area of research that warrants further rigorous study before firm conclusions can be drawn about whether specific nutritional supplements might lessen the risk of COVID-19 infection," he cautions.Vitamin D deficiency may impair muscle functionGarvan Institute of Medical Research (Australia), April 16, 2021Vitamin D deficiency may impair muscle function due to a reduction in energy production in the muscles, according to a mouse study published in the Journal of Endocrinology. 

- This may suggest that preventing vitamin D deficiency in older adults could help maintain better muscle strength and function and reduce age related muscle deterioration, but further studies are needed to confirm this.Vitamin D is a hormone well known to be important for maintaining bone health and preventing rickets and osteoporosis. 

- Although these studies report association rather than causation, the benefits of vitamin D supplementation are now a major subject of health debate. 

- Determining the role of vitamin D in muscle performance of older people is also difficult, as they may suffer from a number of pre-existing health conditions that can also affect their vitamin D status. 

- Therefore, previous studies have been unable to determine how vitamin D may directly affect muscle performance.Dr Andrew Philp and his team at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia, and collaborating universities, used a mouse model to determine the effects of diet-induced vitamin D deficiency on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in young, male mice. 

- He says it is conceivable that a depression treatment derived from psilocybin could be developed without the psychedelic effects so people can take it safely at home without requiring a full day in a care facility.For their study, led by UMSOM MD/PhD student Natalie Hesselgrave, the team used a mouse model of depression in which mice were stressed for several hours a day over 2-3 weeks. 

- "This new study has interesting implications, and shows that more basic research is needed in animals to reveal the mechanisms for how these drugs work, so that treatments for these devastating disorders can be developed" says Albert E. Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and Dean, University of Maryland School of Medicine.Tea compound promotes formation of osteoblasts under inflammatory environment and increases bone massFirst Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (China), April 7, 2021According to news originating from Suzhou, People’s Republic of China, the research stated, “Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a disease of bone mass reduction and structural changes due to estrogen deficiency, which can eventually lead to increased pain and fracture risk.”Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University: “Chronic inflammatory microenvironment leading to the decreased activation of osteoblasts and inhibition of bone formation is an important pathological factor that leads to osteoporosis. 

- These results suggested that TFDG might have the potential to be a more effective treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.”Patients who are overweight or obese at risk of more severe COVID-19Murdoch Children's Research Institute and University of Queensland, April 16, 2021Patients who are overweight or obese have more severe COVID-19 and are highly likely to require invasive respiratory support, according to a new international study.The research, led by the Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI) and The University of Queensland and published in Diabetes Care, found obese or overweight patients are at high risk for having worse COVID-19 outcomes. 

- They are also more likely to require oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation compared to those with a healthy weight.MCRI researcher Dr Danielle Longmore said the findings, which highlighted the relationship between obesity and increased COVID-19 disease burden, showed the need to urgently introduce strategies to address the complex socio-economic drivers of obesity, and public policy measures such as restrictions on junk food advertising. 

- "Although taking steps to address obesity in the short-term is unlikely to have an immediate impact in the COVID-19 pandemic, it will likely reduce the disease burden in future viral pandemics and reduce risks of complications like heart disease and stroke," she said.The study looked at hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 patients from 18 hospitals in 11 countries including China, America, Italy, South Africa and The Netherlands.Among the 7244 patients aged 18 years and over, 34.8 per cent were overweight and 30.8 per cent were obese.COVID-19 patients with obesity were more likely to require oxygen and had a 73 per cent greater chance of needing invasive mechanical ventilation. 

- "Obesity is associated with numerous poor health outcomes, including increased risk of cardiometabolic and respiratory disease and more severe viral disease including influenza, dengue and SARS-CoV-1," she said.Dr Short said while previous reports indicated that obesity was an important risk factor in the severity of COVID-19, almost all this data had been collected from single sites and many regions were not represented. 

- "At the moment, the World Health Organization has not had enough high-quality data to include being overweight or obese as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease. 

- Our study should help inform decisions about which higher-risk groups should be vaccinated as a priority," he said.Neuroprotective Herbs for the Management of Alzheimer’s DiseaseUniversity of Central Florida and University of California, Los AngelesBackground—Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial, progressive, neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by memory loss, personality changes, and a decline in cognitive function. 

- While the exact cause of AD is still unclear, recent studies point to lifestyle, diet, environmental, and genetic factors as contributors to disease progression. 

- The pharmaceutical approaches developed to date do not alter disease progression. 

- More than two hundred promising drug candidates have failed clinical trials in the past decade, suggesting that the disease and its causes may be highly complex. 

- Indeed, several scientific studies have described the use of various medicinal plants and their principal phytochemicals for the treatment of AD. 

- Methods—This article systematically reviews recent studies that have investigated the role of neuroprotective herbs and their bioactive compounds for dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease and pre-Alzheimer’s disease. 

- Conclusions—Medicinal plants have great potential as part of an overall program in the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline associated with AD. 

- It is prescribed to increase energy, improve overall health and longevity, and as a nerve tonic [86]. 

- Treatment with the methanol extract of ashwagandha triggered neurite outgrowth in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human neuroblastoma cells [29], and, in another study involving cultured rat cortical neurons, treatment with Aβ peptide induced axonal and dendritic atrophy and loss of pre-and postsynaptic stimuli [92]. 

- Subsequent treatment with withanolide A induced significant regeneration of both axons and dendrites and restored the pre- and post-synapses in the cultured cortical neurons.In vivo, withanolide A inhibited Aβ(25–35)-induced degeneration of axons, dendrites, and synapses in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and also restored Aβ-peptide-induced memory deficits in mice [93]. 

- Treatment with the root extract caused the upregulation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, which enhanced the Aβ clearance and reversed the AD pathology in middle-aged and old APP/PS1 mice [96].Oral administration of a semi-purified extract of ashwagandha reversed behavioral deficits and blocked the accumulation of Aβ peptides in an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. 

- Using an AD model of Drosophila melanogaster, researchers noted that treatment with ashwagandha mitigated Aβ toxicity and also promoted longevity [97]. 

- After eight weeks of study, the ashwagandha treatment group demonstrated significant improvements in both immediate and general memory tests compared to the placebo group. 

- Furthermore, the treatment group showed significant improvement in executive function, sustained attention, and information-processing speed [99]. 

- The results suggested the use of Bm in the treatment of age-associated memory impairment.Ten subjects were given 500 mg of Sideritis extract, 320 mg Bm extract, or a combination using a crossover design. 

- Cognitive and mnemonic performance was assessed with validated instruments including Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) and Clock-Drawing Test (CDT) that can assess the risk of MCI progression to AD. 

- Cat’s Claw (Uncaria tomentosa)Cat’s claw (CC) is a tropical vine with hooked thorns that resemble the claws of a cat and is mainly recommended for its potential role in the treatment of AD and pre-AD. 

- Based on in vitro studies, the anti-inflammatory effect of CC is attributed to its ability to inhibit iNOS gene expression, nitrate formation, cell death, PGE2 production, and the activation of NF-κB and TNF-α [45].Using a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, a significant reduction in the Aβ load (by 59%) and plaque number (by 78%) in the hippocampus and cortex was observed after treating 8-month-old mice with the CC extract for 14 days [44]. 

- The suggested mechanisms of the Gb extract are its antioxidant effect, anti-platelet activating factor activity for vascular diseases, inhibition of β-amyloid peptide aggregation in AD, and decreased expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor for stress alleviation [48,49,50].Gb is popular as a treatment for early-stage AD and vascular dementia. 

- Treatment with Gb extract enhanced memory retention in young and old rats and improved short-term memory in mice [49,115].Several studies indicate that ginkgo delays the progression of AD and is as effective as the cholinesterase inhibitors for treating AD. 

- This medicinal plant is used to strengthen the brain, heal skin issues, and promote liver and kidney health. 

- In vitro studies using various Gk plant derivatives (asiaticosides, asiatic acid, madecassoside, and madasiatic acid) showed that these compounds were capable of blocking H2O
It is Time to Dismantle the World Health OrganizationRichard Gale & Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, April 19, 2021The ultimate international authority for infectious diseases is the World Health Organization (WHO). 

- Due to its widespread acceptance by the world's national governments, it has been extremely successful in assuming the helm to monitor regional and global infectious diseases and dictate medical intervention policies to international health agencies. 

- For the majority of the medical community, the media and the average person, the WHO is the front line command post for medical prevention (i.e., vaccination) and treatment. 

- On matters of global health, the WHO holds dominance.For approximately a year the WHO has propagated the belief that the first line of defense for curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic is self-isolation, distancing, masks and, ultimately, vaccination. 

- Although it approved Ivermectin as a cost-effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infections, it disapproved hydroxychloroquine in favor of Gilead Bioscience’s and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease’s (NIAID) Anthony Fauci’s novel and costly drug Remdesivir. 

- Throughout these efforts, the WHO has allied itself with the US's and UK’s national health systems, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and his Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) initiative.Most people wrongly assume the WHO acts independently from private commercial and national government interests for the welfare of the world's population. 

- The legitimacy of the WHO as a gold standard of health is dubious. 

- In his book, Immunization: How Vaccines Became Controversial, University of Amsterdam professor emeritus Dr. Stuart Blume raises the serious problem of the WHO’s most influential advisors on emergency health conditions, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic and earlier the 2009 H1N1 swine flu scare that never was, serve as consultants for the vaccine industry. 

- During times of global emergencies and crises, the WHO confers with a separate group of advisors outside its formal sitting Strategic Advisory Group of Experts or SAGE; the names of this group’s members are not made public.We would add that the WHO’s level of incompetence has resulted in serious misinformation about pandemics, medical risks of vaccines and other health-threatening chemicals. 

- Responding to a petition signed by over 700,000 signatories demanding the resignation of the current WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, Japan’s Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso told the Japanese parliament that the organization “should be renamed the Chinese Health Organization” for favoring China’s policy to stall and obstruct international investigations and for lauding unsubstantiated praise on the country’s transparency and handling of the pandemic. 

- Writing for The Hill, University of Texas at San Antonio professor Bradley Thayer wrote, “Tedros apparently turned a blind eye to what happened in Wuhan and the rest of China and… has helped play down the severity, prevalence and scope of the Covid-19 outbreak.” Thayer concludes, “Tedros is not fit to lead the WHO.” He has no formal medical training as a physician or any international management experience in global health. 

- Immediately before and after his tenure as the Health Minister for Ethiopia’s ruling Communist party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, China had donated an estimated $60 million to the terrorist government and its social programs. 

- As one young healthcare worker reported, there was no “bare necessities of a health care office…. 

- This is a fact in most health care centers in Ethiopia.”During the more recent re-investigation of SARS-CoV-2 origins, the Chinese authorities refused to provide raw case data and created repressive conditions to curtail reliable analysis and disclosure. 

- Based upon all the evidence that has emerged, a large number of professional medical voices are calling the entire investigation a farce.Most problematic is the appointment of Peter Daszak on the WHO’s group to carry out the investigation. 

- Daszak himself has authored 25 studies funded by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, think tanks, universities, military institutions, and ministries directly connected with the Chinese Communist Party.Given the halls of power within the WHO, we are outlining some of the more salient reasons why the organization's declarations about infectious diseases, pandemics and vaccination should not be trusted.Vaccine Promotional MisconductFor many years the WHO's recommendations for certain vaccines were kept secret. 

- Dr. Girard testified as a medical expert for a French court in a criminal trial against the WHO after French health officials obliged the organization to launch its universal Hepatitis B vaccine campaign. 

- The British Medical Journal reported that the WHO failed to report conflicts of interest in its H1N1 advisory group. 

- The former head of the prestigious Cochrane Database Collaboration’s vaccine studies, Dr. Tom Jefferson, told a Der Spiegel interviewer, “the WHO and public health officials, virologists and the pharmaceutical companies... built this machine around the impending [H1N1] pandemic. 

- Der Spiegel reported:“The WHO and those in charge of public health, the virologists and the pharmaceutical laboratories....  created a whole system around the imminence of a pandemic. 

- And the minute one of the flu viruses mutates we’d see the whole machine roll into action.”In 2010, the EU’s Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe launched an investigation into the evidence that the WHO had created “a fake pandemic” in order to financially benefit the pharmaceutical giants’ vaccine market and to strengthen the influence private drug interests have over the health organization. 

- The Assembly’s chairperson Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg charged the WHO’s fake pandemic as “one of the greatest medical scandals of the century that resulted in “millions being needlessly vaccinated.”Epidemic of Conflict of InterestsAccording to former World Bank geopolitical analyst Peter Koenig, about half of the WHO's budget is derived from private sources -- primarily pharmaceutical companies but also other corporate sectors including the telecommunication and agro-chemical industries. 

- Barbara Loe Fisher at the National Vaccine Information Center estimates that "only about 10 percent of total funding provided by GAVI ($862M) was used to strengthen health systems in developing countries, such as improving sanitation and nutrition, while nearly 80 percent was used to purchase, deliver and promote vaccines. 

- Subsequently the EU, FDA, and the Australian, Canadian and Japanese health ministries rapidly purchased and deployed it. 

- In India, health officials recorded upwards to 8,190 additional infant deaths annually following Pentavalent campaign. 

- Days before the summit, one of the WHO's medical directors for vaccination, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, appeared in a public advertisement touting the unquestionable safety of vaccines and ridiculing parents who speak out against vaccination. 

- However, during the Summit, the same Dr. Swaminathan acknowledged vaccine health risks and stated, "We really don't have very good safety monitoring systems." 

- Another Summit participant, Dr. Heidi Larson stated,"We have a very wobbly ‘health professional frontline’ that is starting to question vaccines and the safety of vaccines. 

- I mean most medical school curriculums, even nursing curriculums, I mean in medical school you are lucky if you have half a day on vaccines.”And more noteworthy were the statements by Dr. Martin Howell Friede, Coordinator of the WHO's Initiative for Vaccine Research,"... 

- And in the mid-1990s, a tetanus vaccine being administered to Nicaraguan and Filipino girls and women in their child-bearing years was discovered to contain HCG, which accounted for a large number of spontaneous abortions that were reported by Catholic health workers.Illegal Vaccine ExperimentsIn 2014, The Economic Times of India published a report that provided details of a joint venture between the WHO and the Gates Foundation to test an experimental HPV vaccine on approximately 16,000 tribal girls between the ages of 9 and 15 unwittingly. 

- Investigations led by Indian health officials uncovered gross violations in India's laws regarding medical safety. 

- However, the above provide sufficient evidence to argue the case that, at least within the upper echelons of the WHO, global health does not stand in high priority. 

- On the other hand, the WHO's leaders are there largely because the powers of Washington, London and the pharmaceutical industry benefit by the organization advancing its agendas.Of course, the WHO is not the only health entity with a legacy of corruption. 

- Corruption appears to be systemic throughout global health and national health agencies. 

- This topic was featured last year in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet. 

- Author Dr. Patricia Garcia writes,"Corruption is embedded in health systems. 

- Throughout my life—as a researcher, public health worker, and a Minister of Health—I have been able to see entrenched dishonesty and fraud. 

- But despite being one of the most important barriers to implementing universal health coverage around the world, corruption is rarely openly discussed. 

- "Bear in mind, the WHO, along with Bill Gates and his Foundation, and Anthony Fauci at the National Institutes for Allergy and Infectious Disease, are leading the efforts to get the COVID-19 vaccine administered as quickly as possible. 

- Shiitake mushrooms are native to Asia and are cultivated for their culinary and medicinal value.A study led by UF Food Science and Human Nutrition Professor Sue Percival, 52 healthy adults, age 21 to 41, came to the Gainesville campus, where researchers gave them a four-week supply of dry shiitake mushrooms. 

- Additionally, that much alcohol could suppress immunity, she said.The study was published  in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition.Metabolic changes in fat tissue in obesity associated with adverse health effectsUniversity of Helsinki (Finland), April 9, 2021Researchers at the Obesity Research Unit of the University of Helsinki have found that obesity clearly reduces mitochondrial gene expression in fat tissue, or adipose tissue. 

- If the pathways associated with breaking down nutrients are lazy, the changes can often have health-related consequences.A total of 49 pairs of identical twins discordant for body weight participated in the study conducted at the University of Helsinki: their body composition and metabolism were studied in detail, and biopsies from adipose and muscle tissue were collected. 

- "What was surprising was that the mitochondrial pathways in muscle had no association with these adverse health effects," Pietiläinen adds.Obesity also affected amino acid metabolismIn the study, changes in mitochondrial function were also seen in amino acid metabolism. 

- In the current study, a research team from the Orentreich Foundation for the Advancement of Science(OFAS), Cold Spring, New York, US, aimed to develop an intervention that produces the same effects as methionine restriction, while also allowing an individual to eat a normal, unrestricted diet.An important clue for developing such a treatment is that methionine restriction causes a decrease in the amounts of an energy-regulating hormone called IGF-1. 

- If a treatment could be found that causes a similar decrease in IGF-1, this might also have beneficial effects on healthspan. 

- “Here we present evidence that short-term administration of either organic or inorganic sources of selenium provides multiple health benefits to mice, the most notable of which being the prevention of diet-induced obesity. 

- In the long term, we expect that supplementation with these compounds will also prevent age-related disease and extend the overall survival of mice. 

- It is our hope that many of the benefits observed for mice will also hold true for humans.”Adherence to Mediterranean Diet Is Associated With Lung Function in Older AdultsKapodistrian University (Greece), April 3, 2021Objective: The aim of this work was to examine the association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MD) and lung function in older adults.Design: This was an observational and cross-sectional study.Setting: This research was conducted among community-dwelling older adults from the 2014 Health and Retirement Study (HRS).Subjects: Subjects were 2108 adults aged 50 years or older, 1234 (58.5%) of whom were female.Measures: Dietary intakes from respondents of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) were used for the current analysis.

Study identifies specific antioxidants that may reduce oncogenic HPV infection in womenLouisiana State University, April 12, 2021A study led by Hui-Yi Lin, Ph.D., Professor of Biostatistics, and a team of researchers at LSU Health New Orleans Schools of Public Health and Medicine has found that adequate levels of five antioxidants may reduce infection with the strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV) associated with cervical cancer development. 

- This study evaluated associations between 15 antioxidants and vaginal HPV infection status -- no, low-risk, and oncogenic/high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) -- in 11,070 women aged 18-59 who participated in the 2003-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.Study results showed that lower levels of serum albumin and four dietary antioxidants - vitamins A, B2, E, and folate -- were associated with a higher risk of HR-HPV infection. 

- "Our results showed that the women with the lowest quartile of the nutritional antioxidant score had a higher chance of both high-risk and low-risk HPV infection compared with the women with the highest quartile score after adjusting for other factors such as age, race, smoking, alcohol, and the number of sexual partners in past 12 months," notes the paper's lead author Hui-Yi Lin, PhD, Professor of Biostatistics at LSU Health New Orleans School of Public Health.Human Papillomavirus is a well-known risk factor for cervical cancer, which is the fourth most common female cancer and contributed to 7.5% of cancer deaths for women worldwide in 2018. 

- "Exercise benefit in breast cancer linked to improved immune responsesTumors grew more slowly and responded better to immunotherapy in mice that exercised compared with sedentary mice.Massachusetts General Hospital, April 12, 2021Exercise training may slow tumor growth and improve outcomes for females with breast cancer - especially those treated with immunotherapy drugs - by stimulating naturally occurring immune mechanisms, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS) have found.Tumors in mouse models of human breast cancer grew more slowly in mice put through their paces in a structured aerobic exercise program than in sedentary mice, and the tumors in exercised mice exhibited an increased anti-tumor immune response. 

- "The most exciting finding was that exercise training brought into tumors immune cells capable of killing cancer cells known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells) and activated them. 

- With more of these cells, tumors grew more slowly in mice that performed exercise training," says co-corresponding author Dai Fukumura, MD, PhD, deputy director of the Edwin L. Steele Laboratories in the Department of Radiation Oncology at MGH.As Fukumura and colleagues report in the journal Cancer Immunology Research , the beneficial effects of exercise training are dependent on CD8+ T cells; when the researchers depleted these cells in mice, tumors in mice that exercised no longer grew at a slower rate.They also found evidence that recruitment of CD8+ T cells to tumors was dependent on two chemical recruiters (chemokines) labeled CXCL9 and CXCL11. 

- "Humans whose tumors have higher levels of CD8+ T cells tend to have a better prognosis, respond better to treatment, and have reduced risk of cancer recurrence compared with patients whose tumors have lower levels of the immune cells, effects that were echoed by a reduced incidence of metastasis, or spread, of the cancers in mice that exercised," says co-corresponding author Rakesh K. Jain, PhD, director of the Steele Labs at MGH and Andrew Werk Cook Professor of Radiation Oncology at HMS.CD8+ T cells are also essential for the success of drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as Keytruda (pembrolizumab), Opdivo (nivolumab) and Yervoy (ipilimumab), which have revolutionized therapy for many types of cancer, but have to date had only limited success in breast cancer. 

- The researchers found that exercise-trained mice displayed a much better response to immune checkpoint blockade, while the drugs did not work at all in sedentary mice. 

- "We showed that daily sessions of a moderate-to-vigorous intensity, continuous aerobic exercise training, lasting 30-45 minutes per session, induces a profound reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment that rewires tumor immunity, recruiting and activating CD8+ T cells to an unprecedented level with a non-pharmacological approach. 

- Similar exercise training could be prescribed to a patient referred to an exercise oncology program," says Igor L. Gomes-Santos, PhD, lead author and exercise physiologist and post-doctoral fellow in the Steele Labs.He notes that current clinical guidelines focus on general wellness, improved fitness levels and quality of life, but not necessarily on improved cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy, and that this lack of evidence limits its application in clinical practice.More convincing, mechanism-based data are needed to motivate oncologists to discuss exercise training with their patients, to motivate patients to become more active and to expand implementation of outpatient exercise oncology programs, the investigators say.Higher dietary total antioxidant capacity associated with lower risk of cognitive impairmentNational University of Singapore, April 12 2021.The results of a study reported on April 7, 2021 in The Journals of Gerontology® Series A revealed a lower risk of cognitive impairment among older individuals who consumed more antioxidants.The study included 16,703 participants in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, which enrolled men and women aged 45 to 74 years between April 1993 and December 1998. 

- Disease status and lifestyle factors were updated during follow-up visits conducted every five to six years. 

- “The generalizability of results to other populations remains to be confirmed, and future studies with repeated measures of dietary variables and cognitive functions are still needed.Beneficial effect of quercetin on ovalbumin-induced rhinitisXian Jiao-tong University (China), April 8, 2021According to news reporting originating in Shaanxi, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease, characterized by reversible goblet cells, smooth muscle hyperplasia, airflow obstruction, hyperactivity enhanced, ultra-structural remodeling, and airway mucus production.

Research suggests quercetin can alleviate pulmonary arterial hypertension by regulating inflammatory cytokinesZhejiang Provincial People’ s Hospital (China), April 9, 2021According to news reporting originating in Zhejiang, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “This study aimed to investigate the effects of quercetin in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in a murine model. 

- Thirty-six adult male rats were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (saline), monocrotaline (MCT) - induced PAH group (MCT group) and quercetin treatment group (prevention group).”The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Zhejiang Provincial People’ s Hospital, “After modelling, the animals from prevention group received 100 mg/(kg bw/day quercetin by gavage and the gavage for 20 days, while the animals from the other two groups received the same amount of 0.9% sodium chloride saline solution. 

- The treatment with quercetin significantly decreased the level of mean PAH, right ventricular index and relative expression levels of H1F-1, ET-1, TGF-beta 1, VEGF, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in lung tissues compared with MCT group and significantly decreased the levels of HGF and NAC. 

- In vitro experiment with PCEC (pulmonary capillary endothelial cells) from the three groups showed that in the MCT group the cell proliferation was significantly decreased and the apoptosis was significantly increased compared with the control group, while the quercetin treatment inhibited the MCT-induced cell apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “Quercetin can alleviate PAH by regulating the inflammatory cytokines, promoting cell proliferation and inhibition of cell apoptosis.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Intermittent fasting shown to provide broad range of health benefits in new studyTexas State University, April 7, 2021Intermittent fasting may provide significant health benefits, including improved cardiometabolic health, improved blood chemistry and reduced risk for diabetes, new research conducted in part at Texas State University indicates.Matthew McAllister, assistant professor in the Department of Health and Human Performance, co-authored the study with Liliana Renteria, graduate research assistant in the Department of Health and Human Performance, along with Brandon Pigg and Hunter Waldman of the Department of Kinesiology at Mississippi State University. 

- Their research, "Time-restricted feeding improves markers of Cardiometabolic health in physically active college-age men: A 4-week randomized pre-post pilot study," is published in the journal Nutrition Research (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2019.12.001). 

- It is a way to use fasting each day to promote various aspects of cardiometabolic health," McAllister said.Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has been shown to improve body composition and blood lipids, as well as reduce markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. 

- And the reduction of daily calories would cause weight loss and other health benefits," McAllister said. 

- Results showed that both groups experienced significant reductions in body fat, blood pressure and significant increases in adiponectin and HDL-c. No change in caloric intake was detected among members of either group.The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked with six unhealthy eating behaviorsUniversity of Minnesota Medical School, April 12, 2021A new probe into the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed correlations to six unhealthy eating behaviors, according to a study by the University of Minnesota Medical School and School of Public Health. 

- Researchers say the most concerning finding indicates a slight increase or the re-emergence of eating disorders, which kill roughly 10,200 people every year -- about one person every 52 minutes.U of M Medical School's Melissa Simone, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, collaborated with School of Public Health professor and head of the Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, Dianne Neumark-Sztainer, PhD, MPH, to learn from study participants in Neumark-Sztainer's Project EATbetween April and May 2020. 

- "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the rapid implementation of public health policies to reduce transmission of the virus. 

- "Eating disorders have one of the highest mortality rates across all psychiatric health concerns, and therefore, it is important to try to make links between the consequences of the pandemic and disordered eating behaviors.The study aimed to understand potential associations between stress, psychological distress, financial difficulties and changes in eating behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic through the analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data. 

- To ensure health inequities do not increase, we need to meet the needs of these populations. 

- Because our findings suggest that moderate or severe financial difficulties may be linked with disordered eating behaviors, it is essential that eating disorder preventive interventions and treatment efforts be affordable, easily accessible and widely disseminated to those at heightened risk. 

- "This study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (R01HL116892, R35HL139853: Principal Investigator: D. Neumark-Sztainer), the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (TL1R002493, UL1TR002494), and the National Institute of Mental Health (T32MH082761).Ginseng and anti-obesity: Does Asian variety offer greater weight loss hope?Tennessee State University, April 5, 2021Studies comparing the differing anti-obesity effects of Asian and American ginseng are urgently needed, it has been claimed, not least because they are thought to have opposite medical effects in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).Writing in a review in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, scientists from Tennessee State University said a number of investigations had been conducted on ginseng in preventing and treating of obesity.However, the effect and the relevant mechanisms behind how ginseng works as an anti-obesity treatment are still controversial, they added, and the issue is clouded by the differing uses of American and Asian ginseng in TCM.The former is used to treat yin manifestations of Qi (life energy), while the latter tackle yang manifestations. 

- “However, almost all ginsenosides or extracts in these studies were prepared in the individual labs or from different companies, it is almost impossible to keep the quality at the same level, particularly the whole extract.”The authors concluded; “Although Asian and American ginsengs have similar profiles of active ingredients, the different percentage of crude saponins (4.8%–5.2% in Asian ginseng vs. 7.0%–7.3% in American ginseng) and the specific ginsenoside (Rf only in Asian ginseng, F11 only in American ginseng) may contribute to the different functions of these two ginsengs.” “Therefore, it is very important to compare the medical effects using modern scientific approaches.”Study links prenatal phthalate exposure to altered information processing in infantsUniversity of Illinois, April 6, 2021Exposure to phthalates, a class of chemicals widely used in packaging and consumer products, is known to interfere with normal hormone function and development in human and animal studies. 

- "IKIDS is part of a larger initiative funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes program. 

- The scientists have found links to obesity and low fitness in the upper teens.The present study, published in Journal of Internal Medicine, includes data on 1,258,432 men who, at an average age of 18.3 years, enlisted for military service in Sweden between 1971 and 1995.Particulars of the men's weight, height and physical fitness on enlistment were merged with data in the National Board of Health and Welfare's National Patient Register and Cause of Death Register for the period 1991-2016. 

- The proportion of deaths from all cardiovascular disease also decreased, by 50 percent -- from 1.5 to 0.74 per 1,000.The fact that the trends for cardiovascular diseases move in differing directions over time suggests that other, unknown factors are involved as well. 

- Our results thus provide strong support for thinking that obesity and, to some extent, low fitness by the age of 18 affect early-onset cardiovascular disease. 

- So at societal level, it's important to try to get more physical activity, and to have already established good eating habits by adolescence, while being less sedentary," David Åberg concludes.Clinical trial shows benefit of yoga for side effects of prostate cancer treatmentUniversity of Pennsylvania, April 7, 2021Men who attended a structured yoga class twice a week during prostate cancer radiation treatment reported less fatigue and better sexual and urinary function than those who didn't, according to a clinical trial led by the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. 

- It is the first randomized trial to look at the effect of twice-weekly yoga on the side-effects and quality of life issues caused by prostate cancer treatment. 

- Patients who already practiced yoga on their own were not eligible for the study, nor were patients with a history of prior radiation therapy or those with metastatic disease.Only two instructors led classes for this study, with the lead instructor teaching 75 percent of the classes. 

- The first questionnaire was given between two and three weeks before the start of radiotherapy, then twice a week while receiving radiotherapy, with a final survey filled out within a week of their last yoga class or last radiation treatment, depending on the assigned study arm. 

- "At their baseline, before patients started treatment, patients in both groups were on the lower end of the scale, meaning they reported lower amounts of fatigue," said the trial's principal investigator Neha Vapiwala, MD, an associate professor of Radiation Oncology. 

- "But as treatment went on, we observed a difference in the two groups." 

- Patients who did not participate in yoga trended in the opposite direction, reporting greater fatigue as treatment progressed. 

- "Levels of patient-reported fatigue are expected to increase by around the fourth or fifth week of a typical treatment course, but that did not happen in the yoga group," Vapiwala said. 

- "Researchers also evaluated both groups in terms of their sexual health. 

- Sexual dysfunction - including but not limited to erectile dysfunction (ED) - is reported by up to 85 percent of radiation therapy patients during treatment, often due to the concurrent use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 

- Both groups started out with scores of around 11, and were balanced in terms of ADT exposure; but while the yoga group's score ended up largely unchanged from baseline, the non-yoga group saw a decline over the course of treatment. 

- Vapiwala pointed out that the findings on improved or stable urinary function are consistent with other research on the effects of physical therapy on pelvic floor muscles.The trial also found that while the emotional well-being of both groups increased as patients progressed through treatment, the evaluation scores in the yoga group rose more rapidly than in the control group. 

- "We know that children whose families use corporal punishment are more likely to develop anxiety, depression, behavior problems, and other mental health problems, but many people don't think about spanking as a form of violence," said Katie A. McLaughlin, John L. Loeb Associate Professor of the Social Sciences, director of the Stress & Development Lab in the Department of Psychology, and the senior researcher on the study. 

- "According to the study's authors, corporal punishment has been linked to the development of mental health issues, anxiety, depression, behavioral problems, and substance use disorders. 

- Thirdly, 1,25(OH)2D increased the expression of anti-microbial peptides by epithelial cells that also promoted the defense mechanism against pathogens, by preventing an invasive penetration of pathogens.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Immune intervention by vitamin D supplementation can mitigate the disease burden from asthma and allergy. 

- Training programmes in compassion have been developed because the research shows that we can train and strengthen our mental health. 

- That's why it's important that we also keep them and their well-being in mind," says Nanja Holland Hansen.Sesaminol prevents Parkinson's disease by activating the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathwayOsaka City University (Japan), March 331, 2021Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the degeneration of substantia nigra neurons due to oxidative stress. 

- The viability of SH-SY5Y cells decreased dose-dependently following 6-OHDA treatment, but the addition of sesaminol restored viability to the control level. 

- These results suggest that sesaminol has a preventative effect on PD.Study finds connection between lifestyle choices, Alzheimer diseaseBrigham Young University, April 8, 2021A recent study out of BYU has linked lifestyle choice to Alzheimer's disease, at least to some degree, through findings that show a possible energy gap between the amount of glucose and ketones being used to power the brain.BYU professor Ben Bikman, who studies diabetes and insulin resistance, thought of a fundamental question surrounding Alzheimer's disease and insulin resistance in the brain.Bikman said there has been growing evidence that the brains in humans with Alzheimer's disease are deficient in the use of glucose. 

- "He added that managing the project with enthusiastic students was a delight, making it easy because of the enthusiasm surrounding the project.Bikman said it is gratifying for him to be able to contribute to what little is known about Alzheimer's disease, because traditional strategies and approaches have continued to fail. 

- "Looking at Alzheimer's disease as a metabolic problem, I would say, is the greatest breakthrough in our understanding of the disease in decades," Bikman said.Looking at it through the metabolic side of things allows people to possibly detect the problem years in advance, looking at changes in brain glucose metabolism long before Alzheimer's sets in.Bikman believes that someday the metabolic approach to Alzheimer's will be the standard of care.Moving forward, Bikman said he hopes that people feel empowered when it comes to Alzheimer's disease. 

- "For too long we have viewed Alzheimer's disease as a disease that is no respecter of person, no respecter of choices and that is simply not true," Bikman said. 

- "We have long known that people with metabolic disorders, like type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance, are at significantly greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and we have more evidence suggesting that dietary choices and changes do make significant improvements in someone's cognition. 

- "Even someone in the midst of Alzheimer's disease can see improvements in memory and learning with a lifestyle change, according to Bikman, and he added that he hopes this evidence will help to strengthen that view and empower individuals to take matters into their own hands.New Study Shows Broad Benefits Of High-CBD CannabisHealth Canada Research Institute, April 6, 2021With CBD exploding in popularity, new studies continue to reveal its potential benefits.A new study published in the journal Aging-US reported that high-CBD cannabis has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties and may even help reduce COVID symptoms.Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a non-psychoactive compound in cannabis and is legal in all 50 states.“Cannabis sativa, especially those high in the anti-inflammatory cannabinoid cannabidiol, has been found to alter gene expression and inflammation and harbour anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties,” the researchers at Health Canada concluded.As such, they say specific CBD extracts “may become a useful and safe addition to the prevention/treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy.”Researchers hypothesized that high-CBD C. sativa extracts may be used to down-regulate ACE2 expression in target COVID-19 tissues. 

- Some C. sativa extracts down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, another critical protein required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells.This is not the first study to suggest that CBD could combat respiratory illnesses like COVID.In April 2020, researchers at the University of Nebraska and the Texas Biomedical Research Institute published a peer-reviewed article suggesting that CBD could be included in the treatment regimen for the COVID-19 coronavirus as THC and CBD both appeared to reduce the severe lung inflammation associated with the virus.In July 2020, researchers at the Dental College of Georgia and Medical College of Georgia found early evidence that Cannabidiol, or CBD, may help reduce the cytokine storm and excessive lung inflammation that killed many patients with COVID-19.“Our laboratory studies indicate pure CBD can help the lungs recover from the overwhelming inflammation, or cytokine storm, caused by the COVID-19 virus, and restore healthier oxygen levels in the body,” says co-author Dr. Jack Yu, physician-scientist and chief of pediatric plastic surgery at MCG.In October 2020, the same research group published a follow-up peer-reviewed study identifying the mechanism they believe was responsible for the encouraging results of using CBD to reduce lung inflammation.“One way CBD appears to reduce the “cytokine storm” that damages the lungs and kills many patients with COVID-19 is by enabling an increase in levels of a natural peptide called apelin, which is known to reduce inflammation and whose levels are dramatically reduced in the face of this storm,” they concluded.While this is incredibly encouraging news for relief from COVID, businesses that sell CBD edibles and oils are not allowed to mention these benefits in advertising because the FDA has not officially approved it for any specific treatment. 

- “Importantly, the differences in anti-cancer affects between CBD isolate and extract appear to be negligible.”That’s not all, CBD has shown potential for treating a variety of other ailments such as arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, high blood pressure, Alzheimer’s and more – with little to no severe side effects that are common with leading pharmaceuticals.Big Pharma hopes more people don’t discover natural treatments to common health issues, like CBD, because it could severely impact their profits and influence.Polyphenol pills counter inflammation in women on hormonal contraceptives: RCTUniversidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), April 7, 2021Supplements containing a mixture of polyphenols may counter increases in pro-inflammatory markers in women of childbearing age using combined hormonal contraceptives, says a new study.The supplements, formulated with resveratrol, catechin, quercetin, chlorogenic acid and cyanidin, were also found to prevent the increases in markers of systemic oxidative stress like F2-isoprostane, according to findings published in Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids .“The increase in biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress observed in the present study were possibly caused by the use of hormonal contraceptives, as verified in the [control group], and this change was not observed in the group that used polyphenols,” wrote researchers from the Institute of Cardiology and the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil.“Therefore, the results of this polyphenol supplementation showed that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects observed in the studied population is due to the reduction in plasma levels of PGE2, supporting the conceptual hypothesis, by its action on the inflammatory cascade, probably by COX inhibition.”Study detailsThe Brazil-based researchers recruited 40 women aged between 25 and 35 using contraceptives, and randomly assigned them to receive either placebo or polyphenols (3,000 mg per day) for 15 days. 

- Excretion of polyphenols in participants of the [polyphenol group] was significantly higher than in the [control group], confirming the effective ingestion of capsules and absorption of compounds, which can vary depending on the amount ingested, the chemical structure of the substance and the intestinal flora of the subjects.”Childhood diet and exercise creates healthier, less anxious adultsUniversity of California Riverside, April 9, 2021Exercise and a healthy diet in childhood leads to adults with bigger brains and lower levels of anxiety, according to new UC Riverside research in mice.Though diet and exercise are consistently recommended as ways to promote health, this study is the first to examine the long-lasting, combined effects of both factors when they are experienced early in life. 

- "Any time you go to the doctor with concerns about your weight, almost without fail, they recommend you exercise and eat less," said study lead and UCR physiology doctoral student Marcell Cadney. 

- "That's why it's surprising most studies only look at diet or exercise separately. 

- "The researchers determined that early-life exercise generally reduced anxious behaviors in adults. 

- To obtain them, the researchers divided the young mice into four groups -- those with access to exercise, those without access, those fed a standard, healthy diet and those who ate a Western diet.Mice started on their diets immediately after weaning, and continued on them for three weeks, until they reached sexual maturity. 

- Early-life exercise increased adult leptin levels as well as fat mass in adult mice, regardless of the diet they ate.Previously, the research team found that eating too much fat and sugar as a child can alter the microbiome for life, even if they later eat healthier. 

- Going forward, the team plans to investigate whether fat or sugar is more responsible for the negative effects they measured in Western-diet-fed mice.Together, both studies offer critical opportunities for health interventions in childhood habits. 

- "Our findings may be relevant for understanding the potential effects of activity reductions and dietary changes associated with obesity," said UCR evolutionary physiologist Theodore Garland.In other words, getting a jump start on health in the early years of life is extremely important, and interventions may be even more critical in the wake of the pandemic. 

- "During the COVID-19 lockdowns, particularly in the early months, kids got very little exercise. 

- "Given that exercise was also shown to reduce adult anxiety, Cadney believes children who face these challenges may face unique physical and mental health issues as they become adults in the coming decade. 

- Dr. Ryan ColeLeigh Dundas @ Orange County Dept of Education.Sunlight linked with lower COVID-19 deaths, study showsUniversity of Edinburgh (Scotland), April 9, 2021Sunnier areas are associated with fewer deaths from Covid-19, an observational study suggests.Increased exposure to the sun's rays - specifically UVA - could act as a simple public health intervention if further research establishes it causes a reduction in mortality rates, experts say.Researchers from the University of Edinburgh compared all recorded deaths from Covid-19 in the continental US from January to April 2020 with UV levels for 2,474 US counties for the same time period.The study found that people living in areas with the highest level of exposure to UVA rays - which makes up 95 per cent of the sun's UV light - had a lower risk of dying from Covid-19 compared with those with lower levels. 

- This may reduce the ability of SARS Coronavirus2 - the cause of Covid-19 - to replicate, as has been found in some lab studies.Previous research from the same group has shown that increased sunlight exposure is linked to improved cardiovascular health, with lower blood pressure and fewer heart attacks. 

- As heart disease is a known risk factor in dying from Covid-19, this could also explain the latest findings.The team say due to the observational nature of the study it is not possible to establish cause and effect. 

- However, it may lead to interventions that could be tested as potential treatments.Folic acid, DHA improve factors related to cognitive functionUND Life Sciences (US), April 7 2021.Findings from a randomized trial reported on March 13, 2021 in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease revealed improvements in aspects of cognitive function among men and women with mild cognitive impairment who consumed folic acid and/or the omega 3 fatty acid DHA.One hundred sixty participants received 800 micrograms folic acid, 800 milligrams DHA, folic acid plus DHA, or a placebo daily for six months. 

- Blood amyloid beta levels were measured at baseline and six months.At the end of the treatment period, intelligence quotient, and information, arithmetic and picture complement scores were higher in the group that received folic acid than the placebo. 

- (Amyloid beta 42 levels are increased in the brains of Alzheimer disease patients. 

- “The beneficial effect of folic acid + DHA supplementation on cognitive function may be mediated by amyloid beta protein reduction.”ADHD and autism associated with in utero heavy metals and essential mineralsNorwegian Institute of Public Health, April 9, 2021Levels of the heavy metals cadmium, lead, and arsenic and the essential mineral manganese, measured in maternal blood during pregnancy, were associated with increased risk of ADHD and/or autism in the child. 

- This was reported in a new study from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. 

- It is therefore important that we gain more knowledge about this, says Skogheim and Villanger.ADHD and autismThe Norwegian health authorities estimates that about 3–5 percent of children and youth below the age of 18 have ADHD. 

- No other disease or condition was present. 

- They reported their findings in an article published in the journal Nutrition Research.H. 

- pylori is known to colonize the human stomach and is linked to an increased risk of gastric diseases, including gastric cancer.According to studies, H. pylori increases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate Janus-activator kinase 1 (Jak1)/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) in gastric epithelial cells.ROS also mediate hyperproliferation — a hallmark of carcinogenesis — by activating Wnt/B-catenin signaling in various cells.The researchers hypothesized that lycopene, a potent antioxidant with anti-cancer properties, may be able to suppress hyperproliferation by inhibiting the ROS-mediated activation of Jak1/Stat3 and Wnt/B-catenin signaling, as well as the expression of B-catenin target genes.To test their hypothesis, they measured the ROS levels and viability of H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial AGS cells before and after lycopene treatment. 

- The Jak1/Stat3 inhibitor AG490 served as the control treatment.They also measured the protein levels of the following:Total and phosphorylated Jak1/Stat3Wnt/B-catenin signaling moleculesWnt-1Lipoprotein-related protein 5B-catenin target oncogenes (c-Myc and cyclin E)The researchers found that lycopene, like AG490, reduced ROS levels and inhibited the activation of Jak1/Stat3, alterations in the levels of Wnt/B-catenin multiprotein complex molecules, the expression of c-Myc and cyclin E and the proliferation of H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial AGS cells.Lycopene and AG490 also inhibited the increase in Wnt-1 and lipoprotein-related protein 5 expression caused by H. pylori infection.Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that lycopene can be used to prevent H. pylori-associated gastric diseases, thanks to its inhibitory effects on gastric cell hyperproliferation.Less sugar, please! 

- To understand how we lose muscles due to illness, inactivity, or age, getting to grips with the specific mechanisms involved is a key challenge for medical science.A team of scientists from Tokyo Metropolitan University led by Assistant Professor Yasuro Furuichi, Associate Professor Yasuko Manabe and Professor Nobuharu L Fujii have been studying how skeletal muscle satellite cells multiply outside the body. 

- This might explain why loss of muscle mass is seen in diabetic patients, and may have significant implications for how we might keep our muscles healthier for longer.Higher plasma glutathione levels associated with decreased risk of Alzheimer diseaseKapodistrian University (Greece), March 31, 2021According to news reporting originating in Athens, Greece,research stated, “Potential links between oxidative stress and the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been reported in the existing literature. 

- Biological markers of oxidative stress, such as the reduced form of glutathione (GSH), may have a potential role as predictive biomarkers for AD development.”Funders for this research include Alzheimer’s Association, ESPA-EU program Excellence Grant (ARISTEIA), Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity (Greece).The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, “The aim of the present study was to explore the longitudinal associations between plasma GSH and the risk of developing AD or cognitive decline, in a sample of community-dwelling, non-demented older adults. 

- The researchers compared the health of women who ate both oranges and grapefruit regularly versus those who did not.Compounds in citrus fruit improve circulation and blood flow, reducing stroke riskThe study looked at the flavonoid content of citrus fruits and how they impacted blood vessel health. 

- Previous studies have found that specific orange phytochemicals are protective against intracerebral hemorrhage and considerably improve blood flow in the brain.Researchers reviewed around 14 years of Nurse’s Health Study data tracking the health and diets of about 70,000 women. 

- Higher intake of all kinds of fruit has a positive impact on stroke risk as well as many other areas of health.A 2011 study by Western University in London, Ontario found that an additional benefit of flavonoid intake was the prevention of weight gain. 

- The Nobiletin in citrus fruit has also been linked with apoptosis, or programmed cell death of cancer cells.Oregon Health & Science University researchers found a connection between eye health and the vitamin C found in citrus fruit. 

- Retinal nerve cells benefited from the compound, and it’s likely brain and nervous system health are positively impacted as well.While fruit juice packs a potent nutritional punch, there are advantages to eating whole oranges, grapefruits and other fruits instead. 

- Whole fruits tend to be richer in vitamins and nutrients, lower in sugar, and higher in fiber.For older patients, focusing on what matters is often the best medicineYale University, April 4, 2021A woman in her 80s wanted to play with her great-grandchildren when they came to visit, but knee pain made it difficult for her. 

- Understanding these goals and barriers to them, helps doctors align care with what matters most to their patients while eliminating unwanted health care, said the authors of a report that was published March 24 in JAMA Network Open.The report, the first systematic description of older adults' health care priorities, describes a structured process called Patient Health Priorities that health care providers can follow to identify the life goals of older adults with multiple chronic conditions as well as their health care preferences. 

- "There is growing awareness of the need to transition health care, particularly for people with multiple chronic conditions, from treating single diseases in isolation to health care that is aligned with patients' priorities," said Mary Tinetti, MD, the principal investigator of the Patient Priorities Care study, and the Gladys Phillips Crofoot Professor of Medicine (Geriatrics) at Yale School of Medicine (YSM).During the study, health care providers asked 163 patients who were 65 and older and have multiple chronic conditions to identify what they value most in life such as connecting with family, being productive, or remaining independent. 

- The participants also were asked to describe the barriers that prevented them from achieving their goals, such as unnecessary doctors' visits, taking too many medications, or health concerns such as fatigue and shortness of breath. 

- "The medications, health care visits, testing, procedures, and self-management tasks entailed in treating multiple chronic conditions require investments of time and effort that may be burdensome and conflict with what patients are willing and able to do," Tinetti said.The study was conducted among patients of 10 primary care doctors from a multi-site practice in Connecticut who invited patients to participate during routine visits. 

- Participants had to be 65 or older and have at least three chronic health conditions that were treated with at least 10 prescription medications. 

- Their health care providers then worked with them to make sure their care was focused on achieving those goals. 

- Participants also were asked what health issues most interfered with their goals, and what aspects of their health care they found helpful and which they felt were unhelpful to too burdensome.The 163 participants identified 459 outcome goals, the most common of which were sharing meals with friends and family (7.8%); visiting with grandchildren (16.3%); going shopping (6.1%), and exercising (4.6%). 

- "If a patient's outcome goals are not achievable or realistic given their health status, a conversation might include, "I worry that you might not be able to continue driving your friends to the theater. 

- People can use the website to identify their priorities so they can discuss them with their health care team. 

- "When there isn't a healthcare provider available to do the health priorities identification, there is now this option of the self-directed website," said Jessica Esterson, MPH, project director in the Section of Geriatrics at YSM. 

- "The website walks people through the Patient Priorities Care health priorities identification process. 

- At the end they will have a summary to bring to their doctors that outlines their health priorities—the activities they want their health care to help them achieve based on what they are willing and able to do.Tinetti encourages people of all ages, particularly older adults with multiple health conditions, to use MyHealthPriorities.org. 

- "It will help you think about things you haven't thought about before, and better understand what matters most to you about your health and health care," Tinetti said.

- )Koyama also offered a caveat for those looking to use essential oils for treatment, in particular, warning against the use of any essential oils. 

- “Even if you say you used lavender, when the lavender was harvested, where it was harvested, how it was stored—all of this makes a difference in the chemical composition.”The team is also hopeful that their results will warrant further studies to determine an exact chemical composition for beta-caryophyllene that can be used to treat skin wounds.“There are many things to test before we can start using it clinically, but our results are very promising and exciting; someday in the near future, we may be able to develop a drug and drug delivery methods using the chemical compounds found in essential oils,” she added.Exercise may help slow cognitive decline in some people with Parkinson's diseaseHallym University (South Korea), April 1, 2021For people with Parkinson's disease, problems with thinking and memory skills are among the most common nonmotor symptoms of the disease. 

- A new study shows that exercise may help slow cognitive decline for some people with the disease. 

- The study is published in the March 31, 2021, online issue of Neurology.Research has suggested that people with Parkinson's who have the gene variant apolipoprotein E e4, or APOE e4, may experience faster cognitive decline and earlier in the disease than people without the variant. 

- APOE e4 is known as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. 

- The study looked at whether exercise could play a role in slowing cognitive decline for people with APOE e4. 

- "Problems with thinking skills and memory can have a negative impact on people's quality of life and ability to function, so it's exciting that increasing physical activitycould have the potential to delay or prevent cognitive decline," said study author Jin-Sun Jun, M.D., of Hallym University in Seoul, Korea.The study involved 173 people with early Parkinson's disease who were on average 63 years old at the time and 59 years old when they developed the disease. 

- "Additional research is needed to confirm our findings, but these results would support the use of interventions that target physical activity as a way to delay cognitive decline in people with early Parkinson's who have the APOE e4 gene variant," Jun said.A limitation of the study was that participants reported their own levels of physical activity, so there is the possibility that they would not remember their levels exactly.Time to shift from 'food security' to 'nutrition security' to increase health and well-beingTufts and Georgetown Universities, April 1, 2021In the 1960s, a national focus on hunger was essential to address major problems of undernutrition after World War II. 

- In the 1990s, the nation shifted away from hunger toward "food insecurity" to better capture and address the challenges of food access and affordability.Now, a new Viewpoint article argues that today's health and equity challenges call for the U.S. to shift from "food insecurity" to "nutrition insecurity" in order to catalyze appropriate focus and policies on access not just to food but to healthy, nourishing food.The Viewpoint, by Dariush Mozaffarian of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science & Policy at Tufts University, Sheila Fleischhacker of Georgetown Law School, and José Andrés of World Central Kitchen, was published online in JAMA this week.The concept of food security focuses on access to and affordability of food that is safe, nutritious, and consistent with personal preferences. 

- With a new focus on nutrition security, we embrace a solution that nourishes people, instead of filling them with food but leaving them hungry," said Chef José Andrés, founder of World Central Kitchen.The authors define nutrition security as having consistent access to and availability and affordability of foods and beverages that promote well-being, while preventing -- and, if needed, treating -- disease. 

- Nutrition security provides a more inclusive view that recognizes that foods must nourish all people. 

- "'Nutrition security' incorporates all the aims of food security but with additional emphasis on the need for wholesome, healthful foods and drinks for all. 

- COVID-19 has made clear that Americans who are most likely to be hungry are also at highest risk of diet-related diseases including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers - a harsh legacy of inequities and structural racism in our nation. 

- A new focus on nutrition security for all Americans will help crystallize and catalyze real solutions that provide not only food but also well-being for everyone," said first author Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science & Policy at Tufts University. 

- "It's the right time for this evolution," said Sheila Fleischhacker, adjunct professor at Georgetown Law School, who has drafted food, nutrition and health legislation and campaign positions at the local, state, tribal and federal levels. 

- "By prioritizing nutrition security, we bring together historically siloed areas - hunger and nutrition - which must be tackled together to effectively address our modern challenges of diet-related diseases and disparities in clinical care, government food and food assistance policies, public health investments, and national research. 

- ""The current approach is not sufficient," the authors write, and "traditionally marginalized minority groups as well as people living in rural and lower-income counties are most likely to experience disparities in nutrition quality, food insecurity, and corresponding diet-related diseases. 

- Treatment aims to help patients lose weight and normalise their lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and blood pressure. 

- In addition to exercise, doctors prescribe a low-calorie and healthy diet. 

- However, it is not fully clear what effects nutrition has on the microbiome, immune system and health.A research group led by Dr Sofia Forslund and Professor Dominik N. Müller from the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC) and the Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC) has now examined the effect a change of diet has on people with metabolic syndrome. 

- Maifeld is the first author of the paper, which was recently published in the journal "Nature Communications".Broccoli over roast beefDr Andreas Michalsen, Senior Consultant of the Naturopathy Department at Immanuel Hospital Berlin and Endowed Chair of Clinical Naturopathy at the Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and Professor Gustav J. Dobos, Chair of Naturopathy and Integrative Medicine at the University of Duisburg-Essen, recruited 71 volunteers with metabolic syndrome and raised systolic blood pressure. 

- Health-promoting bacteria that help to reduce blood pressure multiply. 

- Health clearly improves very quickly and patients can cut back on their medication or even often stop taking tablets altogether." 

- The current trial confirms that people can eat enough bean- and rice bran-enhanced foods to promote gut health at levels shown to prevent colorectal cancer in animals. 

- The Ryan Lab in the CSU College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences studies the potential power of navy beans and rice bran to promote digestive health and to prevent metabolic alterations in obesity, heart disease and certain cancers. 

- I guarantee, nine out of 10 of my patients, the first thing they ask is about their diet," Brown said.The study's lead author is Erica Borresen, Ryan's research associate and study coordinator, who worked with colorectal cancer survivors to make sure they ate their beans and rice bran provided in meals and snacks, and that they filled out their food logs and gastrointestinal health questionnaires. 

- "Our participants donated their time and effort, and I want to make sure they understand they are appreciated," said Borresen, who earned her Master of Public Health at the Colorado School of Public Health, and plans to become a physician's assistant. 

- "I really feel that there's hope in this being a practical solution to improve gut health and specifically colorectal cancer prevention," says Ryan.Research suggests L-tryptophan supplements might help prevent impulsivity associated with psychological disordersUniversity of California Berkeley, April 2, 2021According to news reporting originating from Berkeley, California, research stated, “Emotion-related impulsivity, defined as the tendency to say or do things that one later regret during periods of heightened emotion, has been tied to a broad range of psychopathologies. 

- Undergraduate participants (N = 25, 16 women, 9 men) completed a self-rated measure of impulsivity (Three Factor Impulsivity Index, TFI) and daily logs of their food intake and exercise. 

- These data were coded using the software NutriNote to evaluate intakes of tryptophan, large neutral amino acids, vitamins B6/B12, and exercise. 

- Findings provide further evidence that emotion-related impulsivity is correlated to serotonergic indices, even when considering only food habits.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “It also suggests the need for more research on whether tryptophan supplements might be beneficial for impulsive persons suffering from a psychological disorder.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Nutritional supplementation in preconception and pregnancy linked to reduced risk of preterm birthUniversity of Southampton (UK), March 30, 2021Increasing evidence suggests that a mother's nutritional status at the onset of pregnancy has an important influence on the growth and development of her baby, and that a good nutritional status during pregnancy may help reduce the risk of pregnancy complications.A specific blend of nutrients and probiotics was tested in an international multicentre double blind randomized controlled trial NiPPeR (Nutritional Intervention Preconception and during Pregnancy to maintain healthy glucosE levels and offspRing health). 

- "Preterm delivery is a serious, common and costly public health problem worldwide that continues to increase in incidence," said Professor Keith Godfrey from the MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit at the University of Southampton. 

- "Sharing his thoughts, Professor Wayne Cutfield, principal investigator on the study from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, said, "The importance of the preconception period on maternal and offspring health is being increasingly recognized, but there are very few randomized control trials seeking to optimize preconception nutrition."Dr. 

- Their report was published in the journal Food Science and Human Wellness.The scientific community has long considered nutritional supplementation to be a possible alternative medicine or adjunct treatment to conventional therapies for common ailments and diseases.Recent studies show that A. chilensis can reduce postprandial insulin levels by as much as 50 percent and is just as effective as metformin at increasing insulin sensitivity and stabilizing blood glucose levels.The berry’s mechanism of action involves inhibiting sodium-dependent glucose transporters in the small intestine and slowing glucose’s rate of entry in the bloodstream, which effectively reduces the likelihood of blood sugar spikes and the corresponding rise in insulin levels.At the same time, the A. chilensis contributes to cancer prevention since chronically high blood glucose levels are linked to the development of cancers.Studies have shown that diabetics and prediabetics have an elevated risk of developing cancerous growths.Based on the findings of previous studies, the researchers believe that consistent supplementation with A. chilensis could indirectly reduce the risk of cancer and other diseases that are promoted by hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.New research on vitamin D and respiratory infections important for risk groupsKarolinska Institutet (Sweden), April 1, 2021Studies have shown that supplementary vitamin D seems to provide a certain degree of protection against respiratory infections. 

- Four years ago, a synthesis of current research was published that showed that vitamin D supplementation can provide a certain degree of protection against respiratory infections.Now, the same researchers from, amongst other institutes, Karolinska Institutet, Harvard Medical School and Queen Mary University of London, have expanded the earlier material with an additional 18 studies and carried out new analyses.Their results are based on 43 randomized and placebo-controlled studies on the possible relationship between vitamin D and respiratory infections involving almost 49,000 participants.The material the researchers have drawn on comprised published as well as registered but as yet unpublished studies, and is the most comprehensive such compilation to date.The new study adds further information about vitamin D as a protection against respiratory infections, but does not cover the question of whether vitamin D can protect against COVID-19.Daily dose most effectiveWhile the total protective effect against respiratory infections was 8%, the researchers found, for example, that a daily dose of vitamin D is much more effective than one given every week or month. 

- However, the mediation effect of an inflammatory diet and serum vitamin D levels in this link is unclear.”The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Periodontology Department: “In total, 2062 participants aged 60 years or older with complete periodontal diagnosis and cognitive tests from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 were enrolled. 

- The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease (CERAD) word learning subtest (WLT) and CERAD delayed recall test (DRT), the animal fluency test (AFT) and the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) was used. 

- Dietary inflammatory index (DII) was computed via nutrition datasets. 

- None of the participants had previous weightlifting experience.Published in the American Journal of Physiology: Endocrinology and Metabolism, the study is one of the most comprehensive investigations of the health effects of diet and resistance training in middle-aged adults, the researchers say. 

- Participants were 40-64 years of age.The team assessed participants' strength, lean-body mass, blood pressure, glucose tolerance and several other health measures before and after the program. 

- "The moderate-protein group consumed about 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, and the high-protein group consumed roughly 1.6 grams per kilogram per day," said Colleen McKenna, a graduate student in the division of nutritional sciences and registered dietician at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who led the study with U. of I. kinesiology and community health professor Nicholas Burd. 

- The team kept calories equivalent in the meals provided to the two groups with additions of beef tallow and dextrose.The study subjects kept food diaries and McKenna counseled them every other week about their eating habits and protein intake.In an effort led by U. of I. food science and human nutrition professor Hannah Holscher, the team also analyzed gut microbes in fecal samples collected at the beginning of the intervention, after the first week - during which participants adjusted to the new diet but did not engage in physical training - and at the end of the 10 weeks. 

- Previous studies have found that diet alone or endurance exercise alone can alter the composition of microbes in the digestive tract. 

- "The public health messaging has been that Americans need more protein in their diet, and this extra protein is supposed to help our muscles grow bigger and stronger," Burd said. 

- "The American Food and Nutrition Board recommends that adults get 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day to avoid developing a protein deficiency. 

- Their gains in strength, their body fat, lean body mass, glucose tolerance, kidney function, bone density and other "biomarkers" of health were roughly the same.The only potentially negative change researchers recorded between the groups involved alterations to the population of microbes that inhabit the gut. 

- After one week on the diet, those in the high-protein group saw changes in the abundance of some gut microbes that previous studies have linked to negative health outcomes. 

- "We have recommendations for healthy eating and we have recommendations for how you should exercise, but very little research looks at how the two together impact our health," she said. 

- The study team included exercise physiologists, registered dietitians and experts on gut microbiology. 

- "We're honoring the complexity of human health with the complexity of our research. 

- Visceral fat is not only challenging to lose but is associated with an increase in inflammation and disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 

- In fact, high visceral fat area is a greater predictor of cardiovascular disease than waist circumference and body mass index (BMI).A study reported on March 11, 2021 in Nutrients revealed an association between higher levels of carotenoids and a reduction in visceral fat area. 

- The investigation included 310 men and 495 women who received an annual health examination as part of the Iwaki Health Promotion Project in Japan. 

- “Ingestion of carotenoid-rich vegetables (particularly lutein and beta carotene) may be associated with lower visceral fat area, a good predictor of cardiovascular disease, especially in women.”Research suggests optimal time of day to consume longevity-supporting supplementsUniversity of Waterloo (Ontario), March 24, 2021Aging is a disease that can be fought with the appropriate combinations of supplements and behaviours, according to new research from the University of Waterloo.Using a comprehensive mathematical model, the researchers also found that the best time of day for someone to take these supplements depends on their age. 

- Some anti-aging supplements should be taken by young people at night, while older people should take it midday for the greatest effectiveness.The two classes of drugs the researchers modelled are nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and Resveratrol, which have been the subject of increased interest in recent years after reports emerged on their benefits on metabolism and increased lifespan of various organisms.A debate over whether to classify aging as a disease has been ongoing for decades, with the vast majority in the field of aging research now classifying it as such. 

- As recently as 2015, a team of international scientists authored a paper calling it "time to classify biological aging as a disease"--and the World Health Organization has made moves that bring it closer to that definition. 

- Recognizing aging as a disease can encourage investment and promote research efforts in identifying therapies that can delay the aging process. 

- "We can take these drugs that can extend our lifespan and improve our health.

- Departments of Agriculture and of Health and Human Services, recommends limiting added sugars to less than 10 percent of calories per day.Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show Americans between the ages 9-18 exceed that recommendation, the bulk of the calories coming from sugar-sweetened beverages.Considering the role the hippocampus plays in a variety of cognitive functions and the fact the area is still developing into late adolescence, researchers sought to understand more about its vulnerability to a high-sugar diet via gut microbiota.Juvenile rats were given their normal chow and an 11% sugar solution, which is comparable to commercially available sugar-sweetened beverages.Researchers then had the rats perform a hippocampus-dependent memory task designed to measure episodic contextual memory, or remembering the context where they had seen a familiar object before. 

- "Early life sugar consumption seems to selectively impair their hippocampal learning and memory," Noble said.Additional analyses determined that high sugar consumption led to elevated levels of Parabacteroides in the gut microbiome, the more than 100 trillion microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract that play a role in human health and disease.To better identify the mechanism by which the bacteria impacted memory and learning, researchers experimentally increased levels of Parabacteroides in the microbiome of rats that had never consumed sugar. 

- Nothing surprises me these days in medical practice, so without a pause I remind him that we are not currently offering a bespoke domiciliary vaccination service. 

- The authorities have also created a parallel pandemic of assorted neuroses and mental health illnesses. 

- Whitty is but one very flawed supra-specialised man without the necessary broad wisdom and holistic medical experience to aid his reason. 

- There was a time when the GMC would have erased Whitty from the medical register for coercing patients into unethical and experimental commercially advantageous treatments. 

- That Whitty is confident he can take on a whole medical profession of wiser and more bioethical, morally inclined patient-centred colleagues is a measure of how far medically-driven technocratic totalitarianism has come in one year. 

- When the GMC and CMO demonstrate this unethical approach to bioethics our society has a profound disease. 

- The global response is neither characteristically scientific nor medical. 

- That expression utilises the corporate tactics of PR, management, HR and Health & Safety risk-aversion to create the end product: a rapid siphoning off of wealth and autonomy from the individual to the state and its corporate handlers. 

- In the more innocent medical times of 1968-69, 1-2 million died of Hong Kong flu globally, with 80,000 in the UK. 

- The virus may become an additional virus of the winter landscape, so I suggest that a cheaper and more sustainable way out of this and further pandemics would be to double winter ICU capacity, increase the number of general medical overflow wards and consider ivermectinand hydroxychloroquine.

High-fiber diet may play a role in controlling the inflammation associated with COVID-19In vitro treatment of cells with these molecules reduced the expression of a gene that plays a key role in viral cell entry and a cytokine receptor.University of Campinas (Brazil), March 30, 2021A study conducted at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, shows that compounds produced by gut microbiota (bacteria and other microorganisms) during fermentation of insoluble fiber from dietary plant matter do not affect the ability of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 to enter and replicate in cells lining the intestines. 

- However, while in vitro treatment of cells with these molecules did not significantly influence local tissue infection, it reduced the expression of a gene that plays a key role in viral cell entry and a cytokine receptor that favors inflammation.An article reporting the findings is published in the journal Gut Microbes.Up to 50% of COVID-19 patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 

- SCFAs are important to colon health and maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity.The researchers decided to confirm whether SFCAs directly affected the infection of intestinal cells by SARS-CoV-2. 

- There was also a decrease in expression of the protein TMPRSS2, which is important to viral cell entry,” said Raquel Franco Leal, a professor at UNICAMP’s School of Medical Sciences (FCM), supported by FAPESP and co-principal investigator for the study with Marco Aurélio Ramirez Vinolo, a professor at IB-UNICAMP, also supported by FAPESP.Protection against inflammationThe researchers took colon tissue samples from 11 patients without COVID-19. 

- The treatment did not alter viral load in colon biopsies or cells, nor were there any changes in cell wall permeability and integrity.“That doesn’t exclude the possibility of significant action by SCFAs on infection by SARS-CoV-2. 

- “In this context, it will be important to deepen the analysis of the effects of SCFAs with these parameters, as this could be significant in severe stages of the disease.”Glycine-NAC combo improves multiple defects in aging to boost strength and cognition in older humansBaylor School of Medicine, March 29, 2021A pilot human clinical trial conducted by researchers at Baylor College of Medicine reveals that supplementation with GlyNAC—a combination of glycine and N-acetylcysteine as precursors of the natural antioxidant glutathione—could improve many age-associated defects in older humans to improve muscle strength and cognition, and promote healthy aging.Published in the journal Clinical and Translational Medicine, the results of this study show that older humans taking GlyNAC for 24 weeks saw improvements in many characteristic defects of aging, including glutathione deficiency, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, body fat, genomic toxicity, muscle strength, gait speed, exercise capacity and cognitive function. 

- Their work brings mitochondria, known as the batteries of the cell, as well as free radicals and glutathione to the table in discussions about why we age.Mitochondrial dysfunction and agingMitochondria generate energy needed for supporting cellular functions by burning fat and sugar from foods, therefore mitochondrial health is critically important for life. 

- Sekhar believes that improving the health of malfunctioning mitochondria in aging is the key.As mitochondria generate energy, they produce waste products such as free radicals. 

- "We measured glutathione in red-blood cells, mitochondrial fuel-oxidation, plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and oxidant damage, inflammation, endothelial function, glucose and insulin, gait-speed, muscle strength, exercise capacity, cognitive tests, gene-damage, glucose-production and muscle-protein breakdown rates and body composition. 

- "Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are serious medical conditions affecting memory in older people and leading to dementia, and there are no effective solutions for these disorders. 

- We are exploring the possibility that GlyNAC could help with these conditions by conducting two pilot randomized clinical trials to test whether GlyNAC supplementation could improve defects linked to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and in MCI, and possibly improve cognitive function. 

- "Association found between consumption of ultra-processed foods and drinks and colorectal cancer riskBarcelona Institute for Global Health (Spain), March 23, 2021Consumption of ultra-processed foods and drink could increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer. 

- This was the conclusion of a large study undertaken by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a centre supported by the "la Caixa" Foundation, based on questionnaires about food behaviours completed by around 8,000 people in Spain. 

- Examples of products in this category include sugary soft drinks, ready meals and mass-produced industrial baked goods.Several studies have linked the consumption of ultra-processed foods and drinks to health risk factors, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and an increased risk of premature death. 

- The results were then classified according to the level of processing using the Nova classification.The study, published in Clinical Nutrition, concluded that the consumption of ultra-processed foods and beverages is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer: a 10% increment in the consumption of ultra-processed foods and drinks was found to be associated with an 11% increase in the risk of developing colorectal cancer.Dora Romaguera, first author of the study and researcher at ISGlobal, the Institut d'Investigació Sanitària Illes Balears (IdISBA) and the CIBEROBN, says that this relationship can be explained, in part, "by the low intake of fibre, fruits and vegetables, which are known to offer protection against colorectal cancer, among people who eat a lot of ultra-processed foods, but also by the additives and other substances with carcinogenic potential typically used in processed food products. 

- However, according to Pilar Amiano, researcher at the Guipúzcoa Public Health Service, which coordinated the study: "ultra-processed foods and drinks in general are not yet classified as carcinogenic because the aim of the IARC was not to assess the overall risk of an individual's diet, but rather to focus on specific components that might be dangerous, such as processed meats".She goes on to say that, in light of the results of the present study and the current scientific evidence on the health risks associated with ultra-processed foods and drinks, in particular with respect to cancer, the authors believe "that food and public health policies and the IARC should already be taking food processing into account and discouraging the consumption of ultra-processed products".Hyperbaric oxygen therapy impact on telomere length and immunosenescenceTel Aviv University (Israel), March 23, 2021In a scientifically verified approach, signalling an important breakthrough in the study of aging,  Tel Aviv University and The Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Shamir Medical Centerannounced today that, for the first time in humans, two key biological hallmarks of aging, telomere length shortening, and accumulation of senescent cells, can be reversed. 

- It was conducted by Prof. Shai Efrati, MD, from the Faculty of Medicine and Sagol School of Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University, and Amir Hadanny, MD, Chief Medical Research Officer of The Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research and co-author of the study. 

- Titled: Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Increases Telomere Length and Decreases Immunosenescence in Isolated Blood Cells: A Prospective Trial.A significant breakthrough in the study of agingThe biological deterioration of aging is cited as a major risk factor for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. 

- Whole blood samples were collected prior to treatment, at the 30th and 60th session, and one to two weeks following the last HBOT session, to assess peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) telomere length and senescence.The holy grail of the biology of aging“After dedicating our HBOT research to exploring its impact on the areas of brain functionality and age-related cognitive decline, we have now uncovered for the first time in humans hyperbaric oxygen therapy’s biological effects at the cellular level in healthy aging adults,” said Prof. Shai Efrati.“Since telomere shortening is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of the biology of aging, many pharmacological and environmental interventions are being extensively explored in the hopes of enabling telomere elongation.”Significant improvement of telomere length“The significant improvement of telomere length shown during and after these unique hyperbaric oxygen therapy protocols provides the scientific community with a new foundation of understanding that aging can, indeed, be targeted and reversed at the basic cellular-biological level.”Improvement in just three monthsResults found that the telomere length of T helper, T cytotoxic, natural killer, and B cells increased significantly.

- Up to 4 per cent faster walking speeds were also recorded.Lead researcher Dr Marc Sim from ECU's Institute for Nutrition Research said the findings reveal important evidence for the role diet plays in overall health. 

- "Nevertheless, to optimise muscle function we propose that a balanced diet rich in green leafy vegetables in combination with regular exercise, including weight training, is ideal. 

- "Muscle function is vital for maintaining good overall health, especially bone strength later in life. 

- "With around one in three Australians aged over 65 suffering a fall each year, it's important to find ways of preventing these events and their potentially serious consequences," said Dr Sim.Go for greenWhile leafy greens may be some of our least favourite vegetables, they could be the most important, according to Dr Sim.The research found nitrate-rich vegetables, such as lettuce, spinach, kale and even beetroot, provided the greatest health benefits. 

- "We should be eating a variety of vegetables every day, with at least one of those serves being leafy greens to gain a range of positive health benefits for the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system. 

- Green leafy vegetables provide a whole range of essential vitamins and minerals critical for health. 

- "Building knowledgeThe study, a collaboration with Deakin University's Institute of Physical Activity and Nutrition and the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, builds on Dr Sim's previous research into nitrate and muscle function in older women.It also adds to growing evidence linking vegetables with cardiovascular health, including a recent ECU study into cruciferous vegetables and blood vessel health.Dr Sim said the next step of his research will be exploring strategies to increase leafy green vegetable consumption in the general population. 

- "We are currently recruiting for the MODEL Study, which examines how knowledge of disease can be used to prompt people in making long-term improvements to their diet and exercise," said Dr Sim.Preservative used in hundreds of popular foods may harm the immune systemNew science suggests the FDA should test all food chemicals for safetyEnvironmental Working Group, March 25, 2021A food preservative used to prolong the shelf life of Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Treats, Cheez-Its and almost 1,250 other popular processed foods may harm the immune system, according to a new peer-reviewed study by Environmental Working Group.For the study, published this week in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, EWG researchers used data from the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxicity Forecaster, or ToxCast, to assess the health hazards of the most common chemicals added to food, as well as the "forever chemicals" known as PFAS, which can migrate to food from packaging.EWG's analysis of ToxCast data showed that the preservative tert-butylhydroquinone, or TBHQ, has been found to harm the immune system both in both animal tests and in non-animal tests known as high-throughput in vitro toxicology testing. 

- "Before the pandemic, chemicals that may harm the immune system's defense against infection or cancer did not receive sufficient attention from public health agencies. 

- To protect public health, this must change. 

- More research is needed to understand how PFAS harm the immune system.Food Chemicals RegulationThe Food and Drug Administration's approach to the regulation of food additives does not consider the latest science on the health harms of additives that may be legally added to processed foods manufactured in the U.S. Last year, EWG published Food Additives State of the Science, which highlighted additives known to increase the risk of cancer, harm the nervous system and disrupt the body's hormonal balance.Chemicals linked to health harms can be legally added to packaged foods because the FDA frequently allows food manufacturers to determine which chemicals are safe. 

- But it can also be used in food packaging, particularly plastic packaging, in which case it may migrate to food.EWG's Food Scores database helps consumers find products made with healthier alternatives, and our Healthy Living app allows shoppers to scan products while in stores to choose a better option.EWG recommends that immunotoxicity testing be prioritized for chemicals in food and food contact materials in order to protect public health from their potential harm to the immune system.EWG also calls on the FDA to close the regulatory loophole that allows potentially unsafe food additives to remain on the market. 

- "Transcendental Meditation is a non-trauma-focused, easy-to-learn technique that was found in this study to improve PTSD symptoms, likely through the experience of physical rest," said Mayer Bellehsen, Ph.D., director of the Unified Behavioral Health Center for Military Veterans and their Families, Northwell Health, and study principal investigator. 

- "The randomized controlled trial, conducted at Northwell Health in Bay Shore, New York, assigned 40 veterans with documented PTSD to either the Transcendental Meditation (TM) group or treatment as usual control group. 

- The TM treatment provided 16 sessions over 12 weeks, with twice-a-day daily home practice. 

- PTSD symptom severity was assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), and patient self-report with the PTSD Checklist for DSM -5 (PCL-5).The results showed large effect sizes, indicating a strong TM treatment impact in reducing trauma symptoms for both PTSD measures. 

- Other factors associated with trauma, such as depression and anxiety symptoms and sleep problems, also showed a strong impact of TM treatment. 

- "This trial corroborates the findings of a large clinical trial published in The Lancet Psychiatry," said Sanford Nidich, Ed.D., Director of the Center for Social-Emotional Health at Maharishi International University Research Institute, and study co-investigator. 

- "The current study further supports the effectiveness of Transcendental Meditation as a first-line treatment for PTSD in veterans. 

- The availability of an additional evidence-based therapy will benefit veterans, both by offering them a greater range of options and by serving as an alternative treatment strategy for those who don't want to engage in trauma-focused treatment or who aren't responding to a previous PTSD intervention. 

- In addition, recent research indicates that TM may improve resilience and positive coping strategies, providing further benefit to both veterans and active military personnel.Study: Eating White Bread & Bagels Can Be Worse Than Smoking – 49% Increase In Lung CancerUniversity of Texas, March 17, 2021An alarming study has found eating foods high on the glycemic index (GI), such as bagels, white bread, and rice, increase the risk of developing lung cancer by 49 percent — particularly for non-smokers.In fact, when researchers studied the diets of 4,320 people, they were shocked to find non-smokers with diets high on the GI had nearly double the risk to develop the disease than those whose eating habits remained on the low end of the GI.Foods with high GI raise blood glucose and insulin, in turn causing increased insulin growth factors (IGFs), which are associated with greater risk for developing lung cancer.University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center conducted the study of 1,905 people who had cancer diagnoses and 2,415 healthy people, which was published this month in the journal Cancer, Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, RTreported.“The results from this study suggest that, besides maintaining healthy lifestyles, such as avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol consumption, and being physically active, reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer,” explained Dr. Xifeng Wu, study senior author.Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths in the United States. 

- More the 150,000 people will die from lung cancer in 2016 alone, according to the American Cancer Society.What’s more, a second study revealed Americans consume more than half their calories via “ultra-processed” foods, which directly contribute to health problems like obesity and heart disease.“Ultra-processed foods are products that contain several manufactured ingredients that are not generally used when cooking from scratch, including natural and artificial flavors or colors, artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and other additives,”CBS News explained.Obvious examples of ultra-processed foods include soft drinks; chicken and fish nuggets, as well as other reconstituted meat products; packaged snacks, both sweet and savory; packaged baked goods; and instant noodle products.Lead author of the study, Professor Carlos Augusto Monteiro at the University of São Paulo School of Public Health, Dept. 

- of Nutrition, explained such highly-processed foods are designed to imitate natural foods, but often “disguise undesirable qualities of the final product.”Where a diet of fresh foods and minimally-processed products — like cheeses and simple breads — are healthiest, Monteiro told CBS News, ultra-processed products “are manufactured and marketed to replace those foods, drinks, dishes, and meals.”Such ‘foods’ are generally high in sugars, saturated fat, and sodium and contribute to a wide range of health issues, including diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and many more.Both studies ultimately suggest the need to cut out highly-processed products and return to a natural diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. 

- This light activity within daily routine is not exercise-focused so it can be difficult for individuals to detect these subtle light activity losses. 

- However, light activity and regular movement throughout the day are associated with improved health outcomes for everyone, regardless of health conditions.Sarah Roberts-Lewis, the study lead and a Neurological Physiotherapist at King's College London, said; "Even people who don't do much exercise have been impacted by lockdown inactivity. 

- Moving less is detrimental to health. 

- The World Health Organisation activity guidelines state 'every move counts'; they provide suggestions about light activites suitable for all abilities. 

- "Lifestyle changes are recommended as the first-line treatment for these women," said study author Jean-Patrice Baillargeon, M.D., M.Sc., professor of the University of Sherbrooke and clinician investigator of the RC-CHUS. 

- The new study tested Fit-For-Fertility, a multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention that includes a nutritionist and a kinesiologist, or human movement specialist.The researchers recruited 130 women receiving treatment at a fertility clinic, and randomly divided them into two groups. 

- Women in the FFF group were also asked to follow at least once each one of the 12 group sessions, which included a 45-minute workshop on topics regarding nutrition, lifestyle changes and lifestyle habits, followed by a 45-minute session of initiation to different types of physical activity, including walking, circuit training, step workout and others. 

- The spontaneous pregnancy rate (pregnancy without any fertility treatments) was 33.3% in the treatment group, compared with 12.3% in the control group.The researchers estimate the cost per additional newborn resulting from the FFF program at $12,633 (in 2019 Canadian dollars), somewhat similar to the willingness-to-pay for a newborn resulting from in vitro fertilization, which can cost up to $15,000.

Lion’s mane mushroom helps reduce depression and anxietyTohoku University (Japan), March 21, 2021Several studies have shown the potential of lion’s mane mushroom to help address several health problems including those that are related to brain function.Lion’s mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus), also known as hedgehog mushroom, is a mushroom native to North America, Asia and Europe. 

- Its fruiting bodies are said to contain polysaccharides that are beneficial to the human body.This mushroom has a long history of medical uses, especially in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) where it was used to help support brain health. 

- In recent years, its value in supporting cognitive health has been supported by a number of studies.The mushroom helps Reduce depression and anxietyIn a study published in the journal Biomedical Research, the mushroom was tested on female participants in order to tests its effects on mental health.After taking lion’s mane mushroom cookies for four weeks, the participants reported reduced depression and anxiety. 

- By stimulating NGF biosynthesis, lion’s mane is able to help improve mental health.Meanwhile, in a study on mice, researchers from Tohoku University  in Japan discovered that lion’s mane mushroom may be used to prevent cognitive dysfunction.The Japanese researchers administered 10 micrograms of amyloid-beta peptide to the mice on days seven and 14 in their 23-day experimental period. 

- The study suggests that the mushroom might reverse even the effects of amyloid-beta peptide – a protein believed to cause Alzheimer’s disease.Lion’s mane for cognitive impairmentMoreover, in another study conducted by Japanese scientists, lion’s mane mushroom showed potential in improving symptoms of mild cognitive impairment. 

- Moreover, the researchers conducted laboratory tests on the patients and saw that the intake of lion’s mane did not result in any side effect.In addition, the patients’ scores in the cognitive function scale decreased by the time their intake of lion’s mane mushroom tablets stopped.Quercetin-3-o-glucuronide alleviates cognitive deficit in mouse model of Alzheimer diseaseHua-zhong University of Science & Technology (China), March 22, 2021According to news reporting from Wuhan, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Scope Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (A beta) related imbalance, Tau-hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, in which A beta and neuroinflammation can induce brain insulin resistance (IR). 

- Thus, it is focused on the potential benefit of quercetin-3-O-glucuronide (Q3G), a pharmacologically active flavonol glucuronide, on AD treatment by regulating brain IR and the gut microbiome. 

- Besides, Q3G restores A beta(1-42)-induced reduction of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and gut microbiota dysbiosis.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “Q3G can alleviate brain IR through directly acting on the brain or modulating the gut-brain axis, ultimately to relieve A beta(1-42)-induced cognitive dysfunction.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Research shows possible link between number of fast-food outlets and heart attacksHunter Medical Research Institute & University of Newcastle (UK), March 17, 2021Researchers from the Hunter Medical Research Institute (HMRI), the University of Newcastle and Hunter New England Health (HNE Health) have found that for each new fast-food outlet the number of heart attacks per 100,000 people went up by four.Published in the latest edition of the Internal Medicine Journal the study aimed to determine whether the number of fast-foodoutlets in an area could be considered an environmental risk factor for Myocardial Infarction (heart attack).The team led by Dr. Tarunpreet Saluja from the University of Newcastle, compared all cases of Myocardial Infarction within the Hunter-New England Health District with the Fast-Food Outlet Density (FFD) of each Local Government Area within the district. 

- "Until now there has been very little data on the link between fast-food outlet density and heart attacks, so these results should provide an important consideration for future public‐health policy and community development," said Professor Boyle.Study co-author and Associate Director of HMRI's Data Science Group, Dr. Christopher Oldmeadow, said that developing a new metric to calculate fast-food outlet density was key to the study and there was scope to expand the data to look at more outlets in the future. 

- "Vitamin B6 may help calm cytokine storms in COVID-19University of Hiroshima (Japan), March 14, 2021Vitamin B6 may help calm cytokine storms and unclog blood clots linked to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) lethality, according to a new study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition.In the paper, researchers from Hiroshima University pointed out growing evidence showing that vitamin B6 exerts a protective effect against chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes by suppressing inflammation, inflammasomes, oxidative stress, and carbonyl stress. 

- Deficiency in this vitamin is also associated with lower immune function and higher susceptibility to viral infections.Studies have so far explored the benefits of vitamins D and C and minerals like zinc and magnesium in fortifying immune response against COVID-19. 

- “Thus, our attempt in this paper is to shed light on the possible involvement of vitamin B6 in decreasing the severity of COVID-19.Green space or light at night: How we can improve healthUniversity of Adelaide (Australia), March 18, 2021There is a growing body of evidence that exposure to green space is good for our health but a new study from the University of Adelaide has found that this may equally be due to how much light we are exposed to at night.Spending time in green space can improve depressive symptoms, obesity, and sleep problems, and reduce the risk of breast and prostate cancer. 

- Conversely, exposure to light at night, particularly urban light pollution, increases the risk of breast and prostate cancer, and can worsen depression, obesity and sleep problems.Researchers identified a negative correlation between green space diversity and outdoor artificial light at night for Australian major cities—in other words, the greener your environment, the less the light pollution, and vice versa.This makes intuitive sense, because the more developed an area is, the fewer trees there will be and the more lights there will be.Published in Environmental Research, the study questions whether the health benefits of green space exposure may in part be a result of avoiding light at night. 

- "There seems to be a pattern here—yet, amazingly, no one has put these two things together—until now,"' said lead author Dr. Jessica Stanhope from the University of Adelaide's School of Allied Health Science and Practice. 

- "It is possible that these factors have been confounding each other in epidemiological studies of the associations between residential green spaces and improved health, and urban outdoor artificial light at night exposure and poor health. 

- "We have shown that green space is inversely associated with outdoor artificial light at night, making it unclear whether health outcomes result from the green space, the light at night, or possibly in an interaction of the two. 

- "Researchers recommend that epidemiological studies focus on resolving this problem as a priority, so that recommendations can be made for interventions that would improve the public health. 

- For example, to improve population health, is it more important to plant green space in urban areas to give people in cities better green space exposure, or is it better to invest that effort in reducing urban light pollution, or both? 

- "Some great studies have been done on the association between green space and health, which is a rapidly growing research area; and there are also very neat epidemiological studies of the adverse health effects of exposure to light at night," said Dr. 

- "It is now really important that future studies include both factors so that we can better understand their association—only then can we make better public health recommendations about planning health-giving sustainable urban landscapes. 

- "Given how common vitamin D deficiency is in the world and the United States, we believe that this research is highly relevant right now," said co-author Sweta Chekuri, M.D., of Montefiore Health System and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, New York.Research has shown that vitamin D supplementation can prevent inflammation in other respiratory diseases, but there have been limited studies examining the role of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19. 

- The purpose of the study was to determine whether being supplemented with vitamin D before being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 resulted in less severe COVID-19 disease in patients with a low vitamin D level.The researchers studied 124 adult patients with low vitamin D that was measured up to 90 days before their admission for COVID-19. 

- "Though we weren't able to show a definitive link to severe COVID-19, it is clear that patients with low vitamin D should receive supplementation not only for bone health, but also for stronger protection against severe COVID-19," said co-author Corinne Levitus, D.O., of Montefiore Health System and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. 

- "A study published in the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism last fall found over 80 percent of 200 COVID-19 patients in a hospital in Spain had vitamin D deficiency.Study finds changes in gut microbiome connected to Alzheimer-like behaviorOregon Health & Science University, March 19, 2021New research in mice published in the journal Scientific Reports strengthens the growing scientific consensus regarding the role of the gut microbiome in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease.The study, led by researchers at Oregon Health & Science University, found a correlation between the composition of the gut microbiome and the behavioral and cognitive performance of mice carrying genes associated with Alzheimer’s. 

- While all mice were fed the same diet, the gut microbiome is affected in a genotype-dependent fashion and this in turn might affect your brain.”The findings are the first to demonstrate a direct connection between the gut microbiome and cognitive and behavioral changes in an Alzheimer’s disease animal model, and they are consistent with a recently published observational study in people newly diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. 

- In fact, a U.S. clinical trial for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease is currently underway involving a compound that targets microbes in the gut.The research published breaks new ground.In addition to the cognitive and behavioral changes that were measured, the study is the first to demonstrate a relationship between changes in the gut microbiome and epigenetic changes in neural tissue in the hippocampus, an area of the brain affected in Alzheimer’s. 

- They found a clear correlation, but they still can’t say whether one causes the other.“Microbes may elicit an impact on behavioral and cognitive measures relevant to Alzheimer’s disease via epigenetic changes in the hippocampus,” Raber said. 

- "While more research is needed, it's possible that white button mushrooms could one day contribute to the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.

- ?The researchers were exploring a potential link between consumption of meat and the development of dementia, a health condition that affects 5%-8% of over 60s worldwide.Their results, titled Meat consumption and risk of incident dementia: cohort study of 493888 UK Biobank participants, are published today in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Lead researcher Huifeng Zhang, a PhD student from the University of?Leeds'?School of Food Science and Nutrition, said: "Worldwide, the prevalence of dementia is increasing and diet as a modifiable factor could play a role.

- ?Some people were three to six times more likely to develop dementia due to well established genetic factors, but the findings suggest the risks from eating processed meat were the same?whether or not?a person was genetically predisposed to developing the disease. 

- ?Meat consumption has previously been associated with dementia risk, but this is believed to be the first large-scale study of participants over time to examine a link between specific meat types and amounts, and the risk of developing the disease. 

- Alzheimer's Disease makes up 50% to 70% of cases, and vascular dementia around 25%. 

- ?Ms?Zhang said: "Further confirmation is needed, but the direction of effect is linked to current healthy eating guidelines suggesting lower intakes of unprocessed red meat could be beneficial for health. 

- "Tea drinking slashes the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease: Singapore population-based analysisNational University of Singapore, March 20, 2021Tea consumption halves the risk of cognitive impairment for people 55 years old and above, and also dramatically reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease among those at greater genetic risk.These were the key findings of a longitudinal study involving 957 seniors led by assistant professor Feng Lei from the Department of Psychological Medicine at National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. 

- It found that regular consumption of tea lowers the risk of cognitive decline in the elderly by 50%, while APOE e4 gene carriers who are genetically at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease may experience a reduction in cognitive impairment risk by as much as 86%.The research team also discovered that the neuroprotective role of tea consumption on cognitive function is not limited to a particular type of tea – so long as the tea is brewed from tea leaves, such as green, black or oolong tea.“While the study was conducted on Chinese elderly, the results could apply to other races as well. 

- Information on lifestyles, medical conditions, physical and social activities were also collected. 

- Those potential confounding factors were controlled in statistical models to ensure the robustness of the findings.The paper, published in The Journal of Nutrition, Health & Aging, stated: "A total of 72 incidents of neurocognitive disorders (NCD) were identified from the cohort. 

- Gender and genetic factors could possibly modulate this association, it added.Exposure to common chemical during pregnancy may reduce protection against breast cancerResearch suggests propylparaben is an endocrine disruptorUniversity of Massachusetts, March 16, 2021Low doses of propylparaben - a chemical preservative found in food, drugs and cosmetics - can alter pregnancy-related changes in the breast in ways that may lessen the protection against breast cancer that pregnancy hormones normally convey, according to University of Massachusetts Amherst research.The findings, published March 16 in the journal Endocrinology, suggest that propylparaben is an endocrine-disrupting chemical that interferes with the actions of hormones, says environmental health scientist Laura Vandenberg, the study's senior author. 

- "It is critical that relevant public health agencies address endocrine-disrupting chemicals as a matter of policy. 

- "Low magnesium levels associated with depressive symptoms and metabolic disorders in menPomeranian Medical University (Poland), March 19, 2021According to news reporting from Szczecin, Poland, research stated, “Background: changes in the concentration of magnesium influence numerous processes in the body, such as hormone and lipid metabolism, nerve conduction, a number of biochemical pathways in the brain, and metabolic cycles. 

- As a result, changes in magnesium concentration may contribute to the emergence of such pathologies as depressive and metabolic disorders, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Pomeranian Medical University: “Methods: blood samples were taken from 342 men whose mean age was 61.66 ± 6.38 years. 

- These findings may contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis and treatment of patients with these conditions.”Self-compassion can lessen feelings of work-from-home loneliness, finds studyIndiana University, March 19, 2021The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is keeping millions of Americans from their usual offices, as they find themselves still working at home. 

- The research appears in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology. 

- "We wanted to understand what factors are driving feelings of work loneliness, and to understand how this work loneliness influenced employees' psychological health and work behaviors," Andel said. 

- Andel is optimistic about its potential to enhance the health and well-being of employees. 

- Choline supplements may help delay dementia in APOE4 gene carriersMIT and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, March 18, 2021Researchers found that the APOE4 gene may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other dementias by altering brain cells' lipid metabolism.Choline supplements reversed these defects in cell studies, supporting further research in people carrying APOE4.Certain genes can increase the risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. 

- ApoE4 is the strongest risk factor gene for Alzheimer's disease, although inheriting ApoE4 does not mean a person will definitely develop the disease.The APOE gene comes in several different forms, or alleles. 

- APOE2 is relatively rare and may provide some protection against Alzheimer's disease.The reason APOE4 increases Alzheimer's risk isn't not well understood. 

- "What we would really like to see is whether in the human population, in those APOE4 carriers, if they take choline supplements to a sufficient amount, whether that would delay or give them some protection against developing dementia or Alzheimer's disease," Tsai says.However, it is important to keep in mind that results from isolated cells don't often translate into successful approaches when tested in people.Acupuncture Tops Usual Care for Pain in Cancer SurvivorsTwo types of acupuncture proved superior, with one better than the otherMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  March 18, 2021Two types of acupuncture significantly reduced chronic musculoskeletal pain in cancer survivors as compared with usual care, a randomized trial showed.Electroacupuncture reduced patient-reported pain by 1.9 points versus usual care, and auricular acupuncture reduced patients' mean pain score by 1.6 points as compared with usual care, which consisted of analgesics, physical therapy, and steroid injections.Auricular acupuncture, developed by the U.S. military and widely used in VA health facilities, failed to achieve noninferiority to electroacupuncture and was associated with more adverse events (AEs), reported Jun J. Mao, MD, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, and co-authors in JAMA Oncology. 

- The multicenter PEACE study enrolled adults with a history of cancer but no current evidence of disease. 

- Treatment consisted of 10 once-weekly 30-minute sessions.The protocol for auricular acupuncture, often called "battlefield acupuncture," was standardized and began with insertion of one needle into the cingulate gyrus of one ear. 

- The frenetic race is underway to vaccinate billions of human beings naively standing in line after drinking from the government health agencies’ and the mainstream media’s cattle trowels of vaccine hype and propaganda. 

- The scam was orchestrated through personal bank accounts with the sole purpose of advancing drug approvals through foreign nations' regulatory medical agencies.One of the largest scandals in modern medical history was the company's anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx that resulted in fines above $4.8 billion for causing over a minimum 60,000 deathsfrom sudden heart attacks and over 120,000 serious medical injuries. 

- The Australian government launched a class action suit against the drug maker on charges that employees allegedly schemed a fake scientific paper that was ghostwritten for a medical journal in order to put Vioxx into a positive light. 

- Some, including Dr. James Fries at Sanford University's medical school, were clinical investigators who happened to speak out about the drug's shortcomings. 

- One email stated, "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live..."But Merck's troubles with the dangers of its products, falsifying data about drugs' efficacy and safety and exaggeration of medical claims go back sixty years. 

- In 2007, its cholesterol drug Zetiawas shown to increase liver disease. 

- Known as a "carrier solution," the standard scientific protocol does not designate it as a proper placebo for measuring the efficacy and disease risks of a drug. 

- One of the more serious risks of aluminum adjuvants is the triggering of an extreme autoimmune response, what Israeli immunologist Yehuda Schoenfeld has called “autoimmue/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants.”In the Cochrane Database Collaboration’s 2016 analysis of Merck's Gardasil, the investigators were so alarmed they filed a complaint against the European Medical Agency for failing to adequately assess the vaccine's neurological harms. 

- Kennedy's in-depth investigations through his Children's Health Defense organization has uncovered evidence that the vaccine increases birth defects in children conceived of HPV-vaccinated moms; miscarriages have increased 2000 percent above normal, and girls are experiencing serious reproductive complications, including infertility, at approximately ten-fold above the normal rate. 

- There is a 10-fold increase for ovarian failure, and 1 in 37 girls who receive the vaccine will experience an autoimmune disease after 6 months of receiving the series of injections. 

- Sadly, across the nation, politicians from both sides of the aisle in state legislatures, notably Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York, are seemingly doing Merck's bidding to mandate Gardasil for all girls and boys upon entering school.Based upon Kennedy's research and documents received from Freedom of Information Act filings, during Merck's own Gardasil clinical trials, 2.3 percent of girls and women between the ages of 9 through 26 developed a serious autoimmune disease and crippling neurological disorders within seven months of vaccination. 

- The most frequent adverse effects were arthritis and anthropathy, autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, Raynaud's Phenomenon, rheumatoid arthritis and uveitis. 

- He stated that according to Merck's own statistics, girls are one hundred times more likely to experience a serious adverse effect from the vaccine than to be protected from cervical cancer.In a 2012 article published in the Journal of Law and Medical Ethics, researchers at the University of British Columbia wrote that ever since Gardasil was approved in 2006, Merck has engaged in an "overly aggressive marketing strategies and lobbying campaigns aimed at promoting Gardasil as a mandatory vaccine." 

- In the case of its expanded Gardasil-9 for adults between the ages of 27 to 45, the company applied for fast tracking two days after the Journal of Toxicological and Environmental Health published a study that the HPV vaccine was lowering the probability of pregnancy for women in their 20s.Unfortunately, the media has indiscriminately colluded with Merck. 

- Its prime directive is selling drugs; its history of crimes and misdemeanors should indicate the company holds little integrity in its commitment to prevent and treat disease. 

- Therefore we recommend people to support the efforts of Bobby Kennedy and the Children's Health Defense in its lawsuit against Merck's Gardasil. 

- Induced by oxidative stress, inflammation — especially if it becomes persistent — is closely linked to the development of many chronic diseases, such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).The researchers discussed the anti-inflammatory activities of BBPs in an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Food.Blueberry polyphenols can be used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritisRA is an autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disease that destroys joints and causes disability in older adults. 

- The etiology of RA is poorly understood and there is no mainstream cure for this disease.According to research, the accumulation and proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes — non-immune cells that make up the membranous tissue that lines joint cavities — may be involved in the destruction of cartilage commonly observed in RA. 

- They then treated the synoviocytes with different doses of blueberry polyphenols.The researchers found that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-a, increased synoviocyte proliferation by around 19 percent, but treatment with blueberry polyphenols significantly decreased proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. 

- Considering the data collection, it was possible to conclude that there is a probable relationship between VDD and a higher predisposition to gestational and postpartum depression.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Also, we concluded that vitamin D supplementation has proven to be a promising strategy for reducing the risk of depressive symptoms.”Lifestyle intervention is beneficial for most people with type 2 diabetes, but not allWake Forest Medical Center, March 11, 2021For people who are overweight or obese and have type 2 diabetes, the first line of treatment is usually lifestyle intervention, including weight loss and increased physical activity. 

- While this approach has cardiovascular benefit for many, it can be detrimental for people who have poor blood sugar control, according to a study conducted by researchers at Wake Forest School of Medicine.In the study, published in the current issue of the journal Diabetes Care, the researchers re-evaluated the National Institutes of Health Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) study that found intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) neither helped nor hurt people with diabetes. 

- "Contrary to the initial findings of Look AHEAD, our work found that lifestyle interventions reduced potential cardiovascular harm and optimized benefits for 85% of those in the trial," said the study's lead investigator, Michael P. Bancks, Ph.D., assistant professor of public health sciences at Wake Forest School of Medicine, part of Wake Forest Baptist Health. 

- "So for clinicians, determining which subgroup their patient most closely resembles should help them determine the best treatment option and reduce any potential harm for that individual. 

- "These results provide support for further investigation into whether these findings apply to other diabetes complications, including cognitive issues, and to assess what interventions would be beneficial for those individuals, Bancks said.Depression doubles risk of death after heart attack, anginaIntermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, March 8, 2021Depression is the strongest predictor of death in the first decade following a diagnosis of coronary heart disease, according to a study scheduled for presentation at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session. 

- The study found people with coronary heart disease who are diagnosed with depression are about twice as likely to die compared with those who are not diagnosed with depression. 

- "This study shows that it doesn't matter if depression emerges in the short term or a few years down the road—it's a risk factor that continually needs to be assessed," said Heidi May, PhD, a cardiovascular epidemiologist at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City and the study's lead author. 

- "I think the take-home message is that patients with coronary disease need to be continuously screened for depression, and if found to be depressed, they need to receive adequate treatment and continued follow-up. 

- These conditions fall under the umbrella term coronary heart disease, which is the most common form of heart disease in the United States .Researchers have long understood heart disease and depression to have a two-way relationship, with depression increasing the likelihood of heart disease and vice versa. 

- Whereas previous studies have investigated depression occurring within a few months of a coronary heart disease diagnosis, the new study is the first to shed light on the effects of depression over the long term.The researchers analyzed health records from almost 25,000 Intermountain Health System patients tracked for an average of nearly 10 years following a diagnosis of coronary heart disease. 

- These results were consistent regardless of age, gender, the timing of depression onset, past history of depression or whether or not the patient had a heart attack.Given the significant impact of depression on long-term survival, the researchers said clinicians should seek ways to better identify depression in patients with coronary heart disease, either by using patient questionnaires designed to screen for depression or by actively watching for signs of depression during follow-up examinations. 

- "It can be devastating to be diagnosed with coronary artery disease," May said. 

- Depression is linked with behaviors that can be detrimental to cardiovascular health, such as reduced physical activity, poor diet, increased smoking or alcohol use and reduced compliance with medical treatment.The study did not evaluate the impact of depression treatment on the risk of death.Wild mint can prevent blood sugar spikes after meals, reports studyNational Chemical Laboratory (India), March 12, 2021Mentha arvensis, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial flowering plant.Wild mint leaves and essential oil are also traditionally used as natural medicines. 

- The wild mint extract also showed high inhibitory activity against a-amylase and ?-glucosidase and significantly inhibited postprandial hyperglycemia in rats with starch-induced diabetes.Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that wild mint has noninsulin-dependent antidiabetic activity and can be used to treat or prevent postprandial hyperglycemia.Exercise during pregnancy may save kids from health problems as adultsUniversity of Virginia, March 15, 2021Exercise during pregnancy may let mothers significantly reduce their children's chances of developing diabetes and other metabolic diseases later in life, new research suggests.A study in lab mice has found that maternal exercise during pregnancy prevented the transmission of metabolic diseases from an obese parent - either mother or father - to child. 

- If the finding holds true in humans, it will have "huge implications" for helping pregnant women ensure their children live the healthiest lives possible, the researchers report in a new scientific paper.This means that one day soon, a woman's first trip to the doctor after conceiving might include a prescription for an exercise program. 

- This is to say that the parents' poor health conditions prior to and during pregnancy have negative consequences to the child, potentially through chemical modification of the genes," said researcher Zhen Yan, PhD, a top exercise expert at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. 

- "We were inspired by our previous mouse research implicating that regular aerobic exercise for an obese mother before and during pregnancy can protect the child from early onset of diabetes. 

- "Exercise and PregnancyScientists have known that exercise during pregnancy helps lead to healthy babies, reducing the risk of pregnancy complications and premature delivery. 

- They found there were significant differences in metabolic health and how active certain genes were among the different groups of offspring, suggesting that the negative effects of parental obesity, although different between the father and the mother, last throughout the life of the offspring.The good news is that maternal exercise only during pregnancy prevented a host of "epigenetic" changes that affect the workings of the offspring's genes, the researchers found. 

- Maternal exercise, they determined, completely blocked the negative effects of either mother's or father's obesity on the offspring.The results, they say, provide the first evidence that maternal exercise only during pregnancy can prevent the transmission of metabolic diseases from parent to child. 

- "The take-home message is that it is not too late to start to exercise if a mother finds herself pregnant. 

- Regular exercise will not only benefit the pregnancy and labor but also the health of the baby for the long run," Yan said. 

- "This is more exciting evidence that regular exercise is probably the most promising intervention that will help us deter the pandemic of chronic diseases in the aging world, as it can disrupt the vicious cycle of parents-to-child transmission of diseases. 

- "Some veggies each day keeps the stress blues awayUniversity of Sydney, March 15, 2021Published in the British Medical Journal Open, the longitudinal study of more than 60,000 Australians aged 45 years and above measured participants fruit and vegetable consumption, lifestyle factors and psychological distress at two time points.Psychological distress was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, a 10-item questionnaire measuring general anxiety and depression. 

- "This study shows that moderate daily fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with lower rates of psychological stress," said Dr Melody Ding of the University of Sydney's School of Public Health. 

- "These new findings are consistent with numerous cross sectional and longitudinal studies showing that fruit and vegetables, together and separately, are linked with a lower risk of depression and higher levels of well-being assessed by several measures of mental health. 

- Ginger compound shows bone-protective propertiesMie University (Japan), March 15, 2021According to news originating from Tsu, Japan, research stated, “Osteoporosis is the most common aging-associated bone disease and is caused by hyperactivation of osteoclastic activity. 

- Daily reminders (text messages or phone calls) were used to motivate patients to practice the meditation and to evaluate their compliance with the study protocol.Fatigue, kinesiophobia, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and weeks four, eight and 12 using the Piper Fatigue Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia Heart questionnaire, and MacNew Heart Disease Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire which examines patients' feelings about how their heart condition affects daily function overall and in three areas (physically, emotionally, and socially).At baseline, there were no differences in the three variables between the intervention and control groups. 

- This pathway plays a role in the induction of chronic stress.The researchers reported their findings in an article published in the journal Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin.XYS is an effective treatment for anxietyXiao yao san means happy, carefree powder in TCM. 

- Its most well-known use is as a treatment for menopausal anxiety and depression. 

- However, treatment with XYS and SP600125, a known JNK inhibitor, for 14 days changed rat body weight and behaviors, along with P-JNK, JNK and P-c-Jun expression levels, for the better. 

- ""While exploratory, our results are promising and suggest that being able to intervene before birth may aid in protecting the newborn brain from the devastating effects of brain injury," said corresponding author Lillian G. Matthews, PhD, a neuroscientist at Monash Biomedical Imaging and Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health in Australia. 

- Prior to joining Monash, Matthews was at Harvard Medical School and the Brigham in the Department of Pediatric and Newborn Medicine, where she maintains a current affiliation.Polyphenols are part of a class of antioxidants found in certain foods and beverages, including almonds, berries, red wine and teas. 

- The spice has also been used for cosmetic and medical purposes for just as long in these countries.In recent years, the medicinal value of curcumin has been the subject of intense scientific studies, with publication numbering in the thousands, looking into the possible beneficial effects of this natural product on many kinds of affliction in humans.This study published reports that topical curcumin gel applied soon after mild to moderate burns and scalds appears to be remarkably effective in relieving symptoms and improved healing of the affected skin. 

- Heng uses curcumin gel for burns, scalds and other skin conditions as complementary treatment, in addition to standard treatment usually recommended for such conditions.Psychedelic science holds promise for mainstream medicineUniversity of Nevada, March 10, 2021Psychedelic healing may sound like a fad from the Woodstock era, but it's a field of study that's gaining traction in the medical community as an effective treatment option for a growing number of mental health conditions.While the study of psychedelics as medicine is inching toward the mainstream, it still remains somewhat controversial. 

- Psychedelics have struggled to shake a 'counterculture' perception that was born in the 1960s, a view that had stymied scientific study of them for more than 50 years.But that perception is slowly changing.Mounting research suggests that controlled treatment with psychedelics like psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, and MDMA—better known as ecstasy—may be effective options for people suffering from PTSD, anxiety disorders, and depression. 

- The U.S. Food & Drug Administration recently granted 'breakthrough therapy' status to study the medical benefits of psychedelics. 

- "The resurgence in interest in psychedelic medicine is likely related to multiple factors, including decreasing societal stigma regarding drugs like hallucinogens and cannabis, increasing awareness of the potential therapeutic compounds found naturally occurring in plants and fungi, and the growing mental health crisis our nation faces," says Hines. 

- Their work, published recently in Nature: Scientific Reports, shows a strong connection in rodent models between brain activity and behaviors resulting from psychedelic treatment, a step forward in the quest to better understand their potential therapeutic effects.We caught up with the Hineses to learn more about the evolution of psychedelic science—which actually dates back thousands of years—their research (which doesn't date back as long), misconceptions about this emerging field of study, and what to expect next.The scientific study of psychedelics holds great promise for people suffering with mental illness. 

- And while not all require pharmacological treatment, unfortunately there's been limited progress in advancing novel therapies for depressive disorders in 50 or more years.Rochelle Hines: It's also worth noting that available therapies for major depression are only effective in specific segments of the depressed population. 

- We're hopeful that as the public view of psychedelic compounds changes, so too will the federal regulations that currently govern their study.Current therapies for mental health disorders can take weeks to become effective. 

- Studies have also reported alterations in the patterns of brain activity during psychedelic treatment in patients with depression.Dustin: Our recent studies support the evidence for changes in patterns of brain activity, and provide additional detail into specific patterns of brain activity that are generated during psychedelic treatment. 

- The brain activity patterns that we've characterized are related to specific behaviors known to occur following treatment with psychedelic hallucinogens. 

- We're now working on studies examining the synergy between psychedelics and nicotine, and whether nicotine enhances the anti-depressant effects of psychedelics.Rochelle: We're also investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the specific changes in brain activity following treatment with psychedelics. 

- Study reveals vitamin C is key to preventing stroke and promoting heart healthUniversity of Rennes (France), March 12, 2021Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient that plays a crucial role in regulating immune function and supporting overall immune health. 

- But recent studies suggest that it may also hold the key to stroke prevention and better heart health in the long run.In one such study, scientists from the Rennes University Hospital in France compared the vitamin C levels of 65 hemorrhagic stroke patients to those of healthy participants. 

- Simply eating vitamin C-rich foods as part of a balanced diet should keep one’s vitamin C levels within the normal range.Red meat consumption linked to earlier onset of girls' menstrual cyclesUniversity of Michigan, March 10, 2021Girls who eat red meat often start their periods on average five months earlier than those who don't.Conversely, girls who consume fatty fish like tuna and sardines more than once a week have their first menstrual cycle, or menarche, significantly later than those who eat it once a month or less, according to research by the University of Michigan.The investigators from the U-M School of Public Health measured the usual diet of 456 girls 5-to-12 years old in Bogota, Colombia, before they had started menstruating. 

- The girls were part of the Bogota School Children Cohort, a longitudinal research project that has examined many issues of nutrition and health.Red meat consumed by the girls ranged from less than four times a week to twice a day. 

- "It is an important difference because it is associated with the risk of disease later in life," said first author Erica Jansen, a doctoral candidate in the U-M School of Public Health. 

- "In addition to breast cancer, early onset of puberty has been associated with heart disease, obesity and type II diabetes. 

- However, there is a mounting body of evidence suggesting that excessive intake of red meat at different stages of life is related to a number of adverse health outcomes, especially to getting some types of cancer," said senior author Dr. Eduardo Villamor, professor of epidemiology at the U-M School of Public Health.Villamor noted that earlier puberty also often results in other public health concerns such as earlier sexual activity, teen pregnancy, and alcohol and tobacco use.Other studies have shown a link between consuming animal protein and advanced puberty, and examined the role of red meat on disease, but this is the first to specifically look at red meat intake in childhood and early menarche. 

- "Mindfulness program in campus dorms, groups improved students' mental healthUniversity of Washington, March 11, 2021As experts nationwide point to a mental health crisis among teens and young adults, a pilot program teaching mindfulness and coping techniques to students at the University of Washington has helped lower stress and improve emotional well-being.New studies by the psychology researchers who created the program find that the strategies, offered first in residence halls and later through classes and other organized campus groups, have provided participants with successful methods for coping with stress, managing their emotions and learning self-compassion.Researchers say the results show the potential for preventive mental health services offered in an accessible, peer-group environment. 

- "This program is not a substitute for campus mental health services for students. 

- Student participants reported significant improvements in their psychological well-being that lasted three months after the sessions ended.During the pandemic -- with millions of young people studying remotely -- the importance of teen and college student mental health has grown. 

- According to the CDC, 1 in 4 young adultsbetween the ages of 18 and 24 has considered suicide in the past year, while separate studies of college students in recent months have found more than 70% report serious distress.But even before the pandemic, campuses nationwide were reporting high levels of student stress and anxiety, with college mental health directors noting need for services that far outpaced availability. 

- Academic demands, financial pressures, social tumult and, especially among first-year students, the transition to campus life all affect student mental health.Against this backdrop, the authors decided to come up with a short intervention at the UW that would provide real-world coping strategies in an environment that students could access easily -- without an appointment or any fee, in the casual atmosphere of a group, and where they already live, study or socialize. 

- "The idea behind Be REAL was to have a new model to promote student well-being and mental health. 

- In their comments on post-study surveys, students reported using meditation and breathing techniques to help focus or calm down, and developing habits to handle stress.The results raised other issues that researchers are exploring further, such as whether providing the lessons in a class that students take for credit creates more of a perceived burden -- and thus, leaves less of an impact -- than sessions in which students simply choose to participate.A new, ongoing study is examining how about 100 university staff from all three UW campuses, trained in offering the program remotely, along with still more students, respond to the techniques for improving mental health. 

- "Vitamin B12 reduces amyloid beta proteotoxicityUniversity of Delaware, March 11, 2021According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from biorxiv.org:“Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment. 

- Diet, as a modifiable risk factor for AD, could potentially be targeted to slow disease onset and progression.“However, complexity of the human diet and indirect effects of the microbiome make it challenging to identify protective nutrients. 

- Vitamin supplementation of B12 deficient adult A{beta} animals was beneficial, demonstrating potential for vitamin B12 as a therapy to target pathogenic features of AD triggered by both aging and proteotoxic stress.”This preprint has not been peer-reviewed.Study shows that inhaling a common manufacturing material – carbon nanotubules -- could inadvertently injure the brainVirginia Commonwealth University, March 8, 2021Virginia Commonwealth University researchers in a multi-institutional collaboration are uncovering the degree to which inhalation of carbon nanotubes—a novel manufacturing material used to make anything from tennis rackets to spacecraft parts—could unintentionally cause neurological disease.Carbon nanotubes are smaller than a human hair, but they are stronger than steel and are shown to effectively conduct electricity and heat. 

- While these fibers have many practical applications, they should be handled with care by workers in the manufacturing sector, according to recent findings by Andrew Ottens, Ph.D., an associate professor of anatomy and neurobiology in the VCU School of Medicine; the Ottens Group research lab; investigators from the University of New Mexico; and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.With assistance from a $1.9 million four-year grant from NIOSH divided between VCU and UNM, researchers from both institutions have found that inhalation of carbon nanotubes causes inflammation in the brain. 

- "Inhalation-induced neuroinflammation is presently a hot area of study as a causal factor in the development of neurodegenerative disease, leaving open the possibility that working with these compounds and inhaling them may contribute to later neurological ailment," Ottens said.The study's most recent findings were published in a paper this winter by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The neuroinflammatory effects of inhaled carbon nanotubes show close links between the respiratory and vascular systems, and the brain. 

- It is this substantial inflammation that has researchers questioning the degree to which exposure to carbon nanotubes may lead to neurological disease.To get a better idea about how carbon nanotubes impact workers, investigators are working to determine airborne levels of the particulate in manufacturing facilities. 

- "We hope that this study can contribute to thresholds and guidelines for the safe use of carbon nanotubes in the industry, and provide diagnostics to assess worker's health, for example, in case of an accident," Ottens said. 

- "Diet high in healthful plant-based food may reduce risk of stroke by 10%Harvard School of Public Health, March 11, 2021Eating a healthy, plant-based diet that includes foods like vegetables, whole grains and beans, and decreasing intakes of less healthy foods like refined grains or added sugars may reduce your risk of having a stroke by up to 10%, according to a study published in the March 10, 2021, online issue of Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. 

- "Many studies already show that eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can reduce your risk of all kinds of diseases, from heart disease to diabetes," said study author Megu Baden, M.D., Ph.D., of the Harvard T.H. 

- Chan School of Public Health, in Boston, Mass. 

- "The study involved 209,508 people who did not have cardiovascular disease or cancer at the start of the study. 

- Our findings have important public health implications as future nutrition policies to lower stroke risk should take the quality of food into consideration. 

- "A limitation of the study is that all the participants were health professionals and were predominantly white people, which means the results may not apply to the general population. 

- In this paper, we highlight the potential application of A. virginicus extracts in future medicinal production and therapeutics of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and blood cancer, which can deal with both crop protection and human health concerns. 

- Urgent Open Letter from Doctors and Scientists to the European Medicines Agency regarding COVID-19 Vaccine Safety ConcernsDear Sirs/Mesdames,FOR THE URGENT PERSONAL ATTENTION OF: EMER COOKE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCYAs physicians and scientists, we are supportive in principle of the use of new medical interventions which are appropriately developed and deployed, having obtained informed consent from the patient. 

- However, by the time of consideration for approval of the vaccines, the health systems of most countries were no longer under imminent threat of being overwhelmed because a growing proportion of the world had already been infected and the worst of the pandemic had already abated. 

- Consequently, we demand conclusive evidence that an actual emergency existed at the time of the EMA granting Conditional Marketing Authorisation to the manufacturers of all three vaccines, to justify their approval for use in humans by the EMA, purportedly because of such an emergency.Doctors and Scientists Write to European Medicines Agency (EMA) Warning of COVID-19 Vaccine DangersShould all such evidence not be available, we demand that approval for use of the gene-based vaccines be withdrawn until all the above issues have been properly addressed by the exercise of due diligence by the EMA.There are serious concerns, including but not confined to those outlined above, that the approval of the COVID-19 vaccines by the EMA was premature and reckless, and that the administration of the vaccines constituted and still does constitute “human experimentation”, which was and still is in violation of the Nuremberg Code.In view of the urgency of the situation, we request that you reply to this email within seven days and address all our concerns substantively. 

- Should you choose not to comply with this reasonable request, we will make this letter public.This email is copied to:Charles Michel, President of the Council of EuropeUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission.Doctors and scientists can sign the open letter by emailing their name, qualifications, areas of expertise, country and any affiliations they would like to cite, to Doctors4CovidEthics@protonmail.comYours faithfully,Professsor Sucharit Bhakdi MD, Professor Emeritus of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Former Chair, Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz (Medical Doctor and Scientist) (Germany and Thailand)Dr Marco Chiesa MD FRCPsych, Consultant Psychiatrist and Visiting Professor, University College London (Medical Doctor) (United Kingdom and Italy)Dr C Stephen Frost BSc MBChB Specialist in Diagnostic Radiology, Stockholm, Sweden (Medical Doctor) (United Kingdom and Sweden)Dr Margareta Griesz-Brisson MD PhD, Consultant Neurologist and Neurophysiologist (studied Medicine in Freiburg, Germany, speciality training for Neurology at New York University, Fellowship in Neurophysiology at Mount Sinai Medical Centre, New York City; PhD in Pharmacology with special interest in chronic low level neurotoxicology and effects of environmental factors on brain health), Medical Director, The London Neurology and Pain Clinic (Medical Doctor and Scientist) (Germany and United Kingdom)Professor Martin Haditsch MD PhD, Specialist (Austria) in Hygiene and Microbiology, Specialist (Germany) in Microbiology, Virology, Epidemiology/Infectious Diseases, Specialist (Austria) in Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Medical Director, TravelMedCenter, Leonding, Austria, Medical Director, Labor Hannover MVZ GmbH (Medical Doctor and Scientist) (Austria and Germany)Professor Stefan Hockertz, Professor of Toxicology and Pharmacologym, European registered Toxicologist, Specialist in Immunology and Immunotoxicology, CEO tpi consult GmbH.

- The benefits of the Mediterranean diet pass on to the families of patients who follow itHospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (Italy), March 9, 2021People living with a patient undergoing an intensive weight loss treatment also benefit from this therapy. 

- This has been demonstrated by a team of researchers from the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM-Hospital del Mar) along with doctors from Hospital del Mar and the CIBER on the Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBERObn), in collaboration with IDIAPJGol, the Pere Virgili Health Research Institute (IISPV), IDIBELL, IDIBAPS and the Sant Joan de Reus University Hospital. 

- The researchers analysed whether these people also indirectly benefited from the programme, as they were not enrolled in the study and did not receive any direct treatment. 

- PREDIMED-Plus is a multicentre study in which a group of patients follow an intensive weight reduction programme based on the Mediterranean diet and a plan promoting physical activity.Weight loss despite not being included in the programmeThe relatives (three out of four were the patient's partner and the rest were children, parents, siblings or had some other degree of kinship), lost an average of 1.25 kg of weight during the first year of the programme, compared to the relatives of the patients in the control group (those who did not follow the intensive treatment proposed by PREDIMED-Plus). 

- These figures were better in cases where the family member ate with the patient and, above all, when it was the patient themselves who cooked.The treatment, aimed at achieving weight loss in people with obesity and high cardiovascular risk by following the Mediterranean diet, "Achieved effects beyond just weight loss in the patient, and this extended to their family environment", explains Dr. Albert Goday, the principal investigator on the project, head of section in the Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition at Hospital del Mar, researcher in the Cardiovascular Risk and Nutrition Research Group at the IMIM-Hospital del Mar and a CIBERobn researcher. 

- "According to Dr. Olga Castañer, the final author of the study and a researcher in the Cardiovascular Risk and Nutrition Research Group at the IMIM-Hospital del Mar and CIBERobn, the good results can be explained "By an improved diet, since the same contagious effect was not observed in terms of physical activity among the patients and their relatives. 

- As Dr Castañer points out, "In addition to weight loss, there was greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, which has intrinsic health benefits, such as protection against cardiovascular and neurodegenerative risks. 

- "The results of the study "Demonstrate the contagion effect, the halo effect, of a treatment programme in the relatives of participants involved in an intensive weight loss procedure, as well as increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet", stresses Dr. Albert Goday. 

- "The beneficial effect of the programme on one member of the family unit can be extended to its other members, which is extremely significant in terms of reducing the burden of obesity on the public health system", he explains. 

- They also significantly increased their physical activity levels, as well as their adherence to the Mediterranean diet.CBD reduces plaque, improves cognition in model of familial Alzheimer'sMedical College of Georgia at Augusta University, March 9, 2021A two-week course of high doses of CBD helps restore the function of two proteins key to reducing the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaque, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, and improves cognition in an experimental model of early onset familial Alzheimer's, investigators report.The proteins TREM2 and IL-33 are important to the ability of the brain's immune cells to literally consume dead cells and other debris like the beta-amyloid plaque that piles up in patients' brains, and levels of both are decreased in Alzheimer's.The investigators report for the first time that CBD normalizes levels and function, improving cognition as it also reduces levels of the immune protein IL-6, which is associated with the high inflammation levels found in Alzheimer's, says Dr. Babak Baban, immunologist and associate dean for research in the Dental College of Georgia and the study's corresponding author.There is a dire need for novel therapies to improve outcomes for patients with this condition, which is considered one of the fastest-growing health threats in the United States, DCG and Medical College of Georgia investigators write in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. 

- "But we have nothing that gets to the pathophysiology of the disease," says Morgan, a study coauthor.The DCG and MCG investigators decided to look at CBD's ability to address some of the key brain systems that go awry in Alzheimer's.They found CBD appears to normalize levels of IL-33, a protein whose highest expression in humans is normally in the brain, where it helps sound the alarm that there is an invader like the beta-amyloid accumulation. 

- In Alzheimer's, that includes turning down inflammation and trying to restore balance to the immune system, he says.That up and down expression in health and disease could make IL-33 both a good biomarker and treatment target for disease, the investigators say.CBD also improved expression of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, or TREM2, which is found on the cell surface where it combines with another protein to transmit signals that activate cells, including immune cells. 

- In the brain, its expression is on the microglial cells, a special population of immune cells found only in the brain where they are key to eliminating invaders like a virus and irrevocably damaged neurons.Low levels of TREM2 and rare variations in TREM2 are associated with Alzheimer's, and in their mouse model TREM2 and IL-33 were both low.Both are essential to a natural, ongoing housekeeping process in the brain called phagocytosis, in which microglial cells regularly consume beta amyloid, which is regularly produced in the brain, the result of the breakdown of amyloid-beta precursor protein, which is important to the synapses, or connection points, between neurons, and which the plaque interrupts.They found CBD treatment increased levels of IL-33 and TREM2 -- sevenfold and tenfold respectively.CBD's impact on brain function in the mouse model of early onset Alzheimer's was assessed by methods like the ability to differentiate between a familiar item and a new one, as well as observing the rodents' movement.People with Alzheimer's may experience movement problems like stiffness and an impaired gait, says Dr. Hesam Khodadadi, a graduate student working in Baban's lab. 

- Mice with the disease run in an endless tight circle, behavior which stopped with CBD treatment, says Khodadadi, the study's first author.Next steps include determining optimal doses and giving CBD earlier in the disease process. 

- The CBD doses used for the Alzheimer's study were the same the investigators successfully used to reduce the "cytokine storm" of ARDS, which can irrevocably damage the lungs.Familial disease is an inherited version of Alzheimer's in which symptoms typically surface in the 30s and 40s and occurs in about 10-15% of patients.CBD should be at least equally effective in the more common, nonfamilial type Alzheimer's, which likely have more targets for CBD, Baban notes. 

- There is some interplay between beta amyloid and tau that decrease the dysfunction of each, Morgan notes.The Food and Drug Administration is scheduled to make a ruling by early June on a new drug aducanumab, which would be the first to attack and help clear beta amyloid, Morgan says.1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D supports bone marrow stem cell proliferationCang-zhou Central Hospital (China), March 1, 2021According to news originating from Hebei, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Osteoporosis (OP) is a common clinical geriatric disease. 

- 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH) 2D) deficiency involves in geriatric disease.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Cangzhou Central Hospital, “However, its effects on BMSCs differentiation and osteoporosis have not yet been elucidated. 

- The study appeared in the journal Cancer Research.Cancer and obesityWith global rates of obesity and liver cancerincreasing each year, understanding how excess fat availability can drive liver cancerdevelopment is important to understand how the disease starts and how it can be treated. 

- The scientists used the Lipometrix lipidomics platform at KU Leuven to see if there was anything unique about the fate of fat in tumor cells and found that the fat species and content in tumor cells were indeed different from non-cancerous liver tissue close to the tumors.For teens, outdoor recreation during the pandemic linked to improved well-beingNorth Carolina State University, March 9, 2021A study from North Carolina State University found outdoor play and nature-based activities helped buffer some of the negative mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic for adolescents.Researchers said the findings, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, point to outdoor play and nature-based activities as a tool to help teenagers cope with major stressors like the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future natural disasters and other global stressors. 

- Researchers also underscore the mental health implications of restricting outdoor recreation opportunities for adolescents, and the need to increase access to the outdoors. 

- They also asked adolescents about their subjective well-being, a measure of happiness, and mental health.The findings revealed the pandemic had an impact on the well-being of many teens in the survey, with nearly 52 percent of adolescents reporting declines in subjective well-being. 

- "Going outside and participating in activities that provide exposure to nature, physical activity and safe social interaction during the pandemic were really powerful in terms of improving kids' resilience," Jackson said.Study finds two servings of fish per week can help prevent recurrent heart diseaseMcMaster University (Ontario), March 8, 2021An analysis of several large studies involving participants from more than 60 countries, spearheaded by researchers from McMaster University, has found that eating oily fish regularly can help prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) in high-risk individuals, such as those who already have heart disease or stroke.The critical ingredient is omega-3 fatty acids, which researchers found was associated with a lower risk of major CVD events such as heart attacks and strokes by about a sixth in high-risk people who ate two servings of fish rich in omega-3 each week. 

- "There is a significant protective benefit of fish consumption in people with cardiovascular disease," said lead co-author Andrew Mente, associate professor of research methods, evidence, and impact at McMaster and a principal investigator at the Population Health Research Institute.No benefit was observed with consumption of fish in those without heart disease or stroke. 

- "Mente said people at low risk for cardiovascular disease can still enjoy modest protection from CVD by eating fish rich in omega-3, but the health benefits were less pronounced than those high-risk individuals.The study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine on March 8.The findings were based on data from nearly 192,000 people in four studies, including about 52,000 with CVD, and is the only study conducted on all five continents. 

- "This is by far the most diverse study of fish intake and health outcomes in the world and the only one with sufficient numbers with representation from high, middle and low income countries from all inhabited continents of the world," said study co-lead Dr. Salim Yusuf, professor of medicine at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine and executive director of the PHRI.This analysis is based in data from several studies conducted by the PHRI over the last 25 years. 

- These studies were funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, several different pharmaceutical companies, charities, the Population Health Research Institute and the Hamilton Health Sciences Research Institute.COVID-19 or something else?Learn how COVID-19 symptoms compare to other illnesses, and when you should call the doctor.Harvard University, March 10, 2021Before 2020, you might not have worried much about a tickle in your throat or a little tightness in your chest.

- Pfizer's History of Crimes and MisdemeanorsRichard Gale and Gary NullProgressive Radio Network, March 10, 2021Whenever it is necessary to make an evaluation of the efficacy and safety of conventional drug-based medicine, it is imperative to include the rising rate of iatraogenic injuries and deaths – medical errors – that has become the third leading cause of death in the US after cardiovascular disease and cancer. 

- Consequently our health agencies' oversight and monitoring of drugs on the market is dismal and deadly.Among the top pharmaceutical companies whose drugs and products have most contributed to the nation’s iatrogenic epidemic is the $51 billion multinational behemoth Pfizer Inc, the world’s third most profitable drug maker. 

- Shortly after the Second World War, Pfizer created snazzy ads for the Journal of the American Medical Association for its antibiotic line. 

- After 100 children were given the drug as guinea pigs, “eleven children in the trial died, others suffered brain damage, were partly paralyzed or became deaf.”  Nigerian medical experts ruled that Pfizer violated international law and the US federal case was eventually settled a decade later for an undisclosed amount.Pfizer’s dirty politics and mafia-like activity in the Nigeria scandal, reminding us of Monsanto’s sleazy schemes, goes beyond the dangers of an experimental antibiotic. 

- Impropriety and medical negligence so far lies on our government’s shoulders and our bought-off corporate media. 

- Federal health agencies simply ignored their regulatory obligations and gave the vaccine a green light prematurely. 

- Its prime directive is selling drugs; its history of misdemeanors and crimes should indicate the company holds no integrity or medical ethics with a sincere commitment to prevent and treat disease. 

- Tune in to find out the latest about health news, healing, politics, and the economy. 

- Why Should We Trust a Vaccine from a Condom Maker?Richard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, March 5, 2021For decades, according to a Guardian article, “consumers worldwide have named the $347 billion pharmaceutical behemoth Johnson and Johnson (J&J) as one of its most trusted brands.” From its humble beginnings in the 1880s, making cotton gauze dressings and eventually band aids, baby powder and shampoo, J&J  has expanded into one of the most powerful multinational pharmaceutical and medical device companies in the world. 

- Today, in most American home medicine cabinets one will find a popular J&J product:  Listerine, Tylenol and Benadryl, Neutrogena skin cream, Rogaine, Neosporin antibacterial ointment, or Destin to treat diaper rashes.Now, people are eager for J&J’s “one shot and you’re done” Covid-19 vaccine despite health officials’ fears it may be less effective than Moderna’s and Pfizer’s mRNA competitors. 

- Certainly, this is not a company with a clean ethical record.A review of J&J’s rap sheet over the past three decades presents a dire and contrary image that should lead us to question the company’s claims about its Covid-19 vaccine given the lucrative market the pandemic has created for the most aggressive medical corporations.Similar to its equally over-sized competitors Glaxo, Merck and Pfizer, J&J too has had to pay out billions of dollars over the decades for civil settlements and criminal activities. 

- As the pharmaceutical giant receives applause across the mainstream media for the release and FDA emergency approval for its Covid-19 vaccine, Brazil’s Public Prosecution Service started an investigation into J&J’s antitrust activities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for “possible improper payments in its medical device industry.” This was part of an FBI bribery scheme investigation that included Seimens, General Electric and Philips acting as a larger cartel to illegally payoff government officials in return for securing contracts with Brail’s national health programs. 

- In 2010, an executive for J&J’s subsidiary DePuy was sentenced to a year in prison for corrupt payments to physicians within the Greek national healthcare system.As one of the world’s leading medical device companies, J&J has had its share of recalls for faulty products including contact lenses and hip implants  In 2013, it paid nearly $2.5 billion to compensate 8,000 recipients for its flawed hip implants  Again in 2016, another $1 billion was awarded to plaintiffs injured from this device.One particular dubious activity the company became involved with in 2008 was to launch a “phantom recall.” When its Motrin IB caplets were discovered to not properly dissolve, it hired outside contractors to buy up store supplies in order to avoid making public declaration. 

- It has no history or expertise in this medical field.However, the Covid pandemic is a cash cow for the drug industry’s taking. 

- It is an enormous pumpkin pie and everyone in the medical universe wants a slice from it. 

- How is it that a drug and household health product company, with no prior history in vaccine development, can develop and rush to market its first vaccine against a viral strain that was only identified 14 months ago? 

- A new effect of red ginseng: suppression of lung cancer metastasisKIST Gangneung Institute (South Korea), March 3, 2021Red ginseng, which has long been used as an ingredient in traditional Korean medicine, has recently drawn increased attention as a functional material for its health-promoting effects. 

- Recently, a research team in Korea has entered the spotlight as they discovered that red ginseng has inhibitory effects against lung cancer metastasis.The Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) reported that a joint study conducted by Dr. Jungyeob Ham from the Natural Product Research Center at the KIST Gangneung Institute of Natural Products and Dr. Hyeonseok Ko of Seoul Asan Medical Center revealed that two components of red ginseng, Rk1 and Rg5, can significantly suppress lung cancer metastasis.Dr. 

- Based on the results, it is important to encourage older adults to avoid sedentary time and increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to improve their glucose metabolism.The study is part of the population-based Oulu1945 survey conducted in 2013–2015 by the University of Oulu and Oulu Deaconess Institute's Department of Sports and Exercise Medicine, Finland. 

- "Older adults with long-term illnesses or functional limitations, who may find it impossible to achieve the recommended level of physical activity, should spend less time sitting down and more pottering about every day to enhance their glucose metabolism," Länsitie says.The right '5-a-day' mix is 2 fruit and 3 vegetable servings for longer lifeHarvard Medical School, March 1, 2021Studies representing nearly 2 million adults worldwide show that eating about five daily servings of fruits and vegetables, in which 2 are fruits and 3 are vegetables, is likely the optimal amount for a longer life, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association’s flagship journal Circulation.Diets rich in fruits and vegetables help reduce risk for numerous chronic health conditions that are leading causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. 

- Yet, only about one in 10 adults eat enough fruits or vegetables, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“While groups like the American Heart Association recommend four to five servings each of fruits and vegetables daily, consumers likely get inconsistent messages about what defines optimal daily intake of fruits and vegetables such as the recommended amount, and which foods to include and avoid,” said lead study author Dong D. Wang, M.D., Sc.D., an epidemiologist, nutritionist and a member of the medical faculty at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.Wang and colleagues analyzed data from the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, two studies including more than 100,000 adults who were followed for up to 30 years. 

- Eating more than five servings was not associated with additional benefit.Eating about two servings daily of fruits and three servings daily of vegetables was associated with the greatest longevity.Compared to those who consumed two servings of fruit and vegetables per day, participants who consumed five servings a day of fruits and vegetable had a 13% lower risk of death from all causes; a 12% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and stroke; a 10% lower risk of death from cancer; and a 35% lower risk of death from respiratory disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Not all foods that one might consider to be fruits and vegetables offered the same benefits. 

- For example: Starchy vegetables, such as peas and corn, fruit juices and potatoes were not associated with reduced risk of death from all causes or specific chronic diseases.On the other hand, green leafy vegetables, including spinach, lettuce and kale, and fruit and vegetables rich in beta carotene and vitamin C, such as citrus fruits, berries and carrots, showed benefits.“Our analysis in the two cohorts of U.S. men and women yielded results similar to those from 26 cohorts around the world, which supports the biological plausibility of our findings and suggests these findings can be applied to broader populations,” Wang said.Wang said this study identifies an optimal intake level of fruits and vegetables and supports the evidence-based, succinct public health message of ‘5-a-day,’ meaning people should ideally consume five servings of fruit and vegetable each day. 

- “This amount likely offers the most benefit in terms of prevention of major chronic disease and is a relatively achievable intake for the general public,” he said. 

- “We also found that not all fruits and vegetables offer the same degree of benefit, even though current dietary recommendations generally treat all types of fruits and vegetables, including starchy vegetables, fruit juices and potatoes, the same.”A limitation of the research is that it is observational, showing an association between fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of death; it does not confer a direct cause-and-effect relationship.“The American Heart Association recommends filling at least half your plate with fruits and vegetables at each meal,” said Anne Thorndike, M.D., M.P.H., chair of the American Heart Association’s nutrition committee and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston. 

- “This research provides strong evidence for the lifelong benefits of eating fruits and vegetables and suggests a goal amount to consume daily for ideal health. 

- In the present study, the ability of melatonin to inhibit receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis and the associated mechanism were investigated.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from China Medical University, “Raw264.7 cells were cultured with RANKL (100 ng/ml) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; 30 ng/ml) for 7 days, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was used to detect osteoclastogenesis following treatment with melatonin. 

- Rev-erb alpha overexpression boosted the anti-osteoclastogenesis effects of melatonin, whereas miR-882 partially diminished these effects.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “The present results indicated that the miR-882/Rev-erb alpha axis may serve a vital role in inhibiting osteoclastogenesis following RANKL and M-CSF treatment, indicating that Rev-erb alpha agonism or miR-882 inhibition may represent mechanisms through which melatonin prevents osteoporosis.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Rhythm Of Breathing Key To Controlling Fear And Emotional BehaviorNorthwestern University, March 2, 2021We live in a fearful world with exposure to a deluge of stressors every day. 

- The long-term results of a dedicated meditation practice include more stable and optimal emotional reactions to the world around us, indicating again that breathing is a critical component of living a fearless life.Study: Diet high in poor quality carbohydrates increases heart disease and deathMcMaster University (Ontario), February 28, 2021A global study of people living on five continents has found a diet high in poor quality carbohydrates leads to a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death.The higher risks of a diet high in poor quality carbohydrates, called a high glycemic diet, were similar whether people had previous cardiovascular disease or not.The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine today, is the largest of a geographically and dietary diverse population on this issue, as previous studies have chiefly focused on high income Western countries.A total of 137,851 people aged 35 to 70 years old were followed for a median of 9.5 years through the Population Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study run by the Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) of McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences.The research team used food questionnaires to measure long term dietary intake of participants and estimate the glycemic index (the ranking of food based on their effect on blood-sugar levels) and glycemic load (the amount of carbohydrates in a food times its glycemic index) of diets. 

- There were 8,780 deaths and 8,252 major cardiovascular events recorded among the participants during the follow-up period.The investigators categorized dietary intake of carbohydrates depending on whether specific types of carbohydrates increased blood sugars more than others (high glycemic index) and compared this index to the occurrence of cardiovascular disease or death.Those people consuming a diet in the highest 20 percent of glycemic index were 50 percent more likely to have a cardiovascular attack, stroke, or death if they had a pre-existing heart condition, or 20 percent more likely to have an event if they did not have a pre-existing condition.These risks were also higher among those people who were obese. 

- "I have been studying the impact of high glycemic diets for many decades, and this study ratifies that the consumption of high amounts of poor quality carbohydrates is an issue worldwide," said first author David Jenkins, professor of nutritional sciences and medicine at the University of Toronto's Temerty Faculty of Medicine, who is also a scientist in the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto. 

- Diets high in poor quality carbohydrates are associated with reduced longevity, while diets rich in high quality carbohydrates such as fruit, vegetables and legumes have beneficial effects," he said.PHRI research investigator Mahshid Dehghan added: "This study also makes it clear that among a diverse population, a diet low in both its glycemic index and load has a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death. 

- This prompted them to investigate whether chaga mushrooms can be used for the treatment of alopecia. 

- The researchers also reported that these lanostane-type triterpenes were more potent than minoxidil, a conventional treatment for male-pattern baldness that’s used to promote hair growth.Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that the lanostane-type triterpenes in chaga mushrooms are potent anti-alopecia agents that can be used to stimulate hair growth naturally.Association of serum folate, vitamin A and vitamin C levels with greater bone mineral densityTiajin Fifth Central Hospital (China), February 22, 20221According to news originating from the Tianjin Fifth Central Hospital research stated, “The conclusions on the associations of specific vitamin levels with bone mineral density (BMD) were controversial. 

- Therefore, the aims of this study were to examine the associations of serum vitamins levels with BMD and the modified effect of race/ ethnicity on these associations in the US adults.”The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Tianjin Fifth Central Hospital: “This study was from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. 

- Serum vitamins A, B9, B12, C, and E levels were assayed using the Quantaphase II Radioassay Kit (Bio-Rad). 

- Serum folate, vitamins A and C levels were positively associated with BMD. 

- No significant associations of serum vitamins B12 and E levels with BMD were observed. 

- There were positive associations of serum folate level (b = 0.00027 and 0.00032; and 95% CI: 0.00002-0.00057 and 0.00002-0.00063, respectively), vitamin A level (b = 0.01132 and 0.01115; and 95% CI: 0.00478-0.01787 and 0.00430-0.01799, respectively), and vitamin C level (b = 0.00027 and 0.00029; and 95% CI: 0.00012-0.00042 and 0.00013-0.00045, respectively) with BMD at femur neck and the total hip only in the Not Hispanic participants.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Elevated serum folate, vitamins A and C levels were associated with a higher BMD. 

- Furthermore, sex and race/ ethnicity modified the associations of serum vitamins levels with BMD.”Study shows mother's diet may boost immune systems of premature infantsJohns Hopkins University, February 25, 2021Medical researchers have long understood that a pregnant mother's diet has a profound impact on her developing fetus's immune system and that babies -- especially those born prematurely -- who are fed breast milk have a more robust ability to fight disease, suggesting that even after childbirth, a mother's diet matters. 

- However, in premature infants, TLR4 can act like an immune system switch, with excess amounts of the protein mistakenly directing the body's defense mechanism against disease to attack the intestinal wall instead. 

- They found significantly lower than normal levels of the receptor, suggesting that reduced AHR predisposes infants to the disease.Finally, the researchers searched for a novel drug that could be given to pregnant women to optimize AHR's positive effect and reduce the risk of NEC in the event of premature birth. 

- After screening in pregnant mice a variety of compounds already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for other clinical uses, the researchers observed that one, which they called A18 (clinically known as lansoprazole, a drug approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal hyperacidity), activates the I3C receptor, limits TLR4 signaling and prevents gut bacteria from infiltrating the intestinal wall.To show the relevance of what they saw in mice, the researchers tested A18 in the laboratory on human intestinal tissue removed from patients with NEC and found the drug produced similar protective results. 

- "These findings enable us to imagine the possibility of developing a maternal diet that can not only boost an infant's overall growth, but also enhance the immune system of a developing fetus and, in turn, reduce the risk of NEC if the baby is born prematurely," says Hackam.Plant-based diets improve cardiac function, cognitive healthBoston University Medical School, February 25, 2021What if you could improve your heart health and brain function by changing your diet? 

- Similarly, changes in cardiac structure and function (cardiac remodeling) that precede the appearance of HF are associated with poor cognitive function and cerebral health.The adoption of diets, such as the Mediterranean diet (MIND) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), which are characterized by high intakes of plant-based foods are among lifestyle recommendations for the prevention of HF. 

- However, whether a dietary pattern that emphasizes foods thought to promote the maintenance of neurocognitive health also mitigates changes in cardiac structure and function (cardiac remodeling) has been unclear until now.The researchers found the MIND diet, which emphasizes consumption of berries and green leafy vegetables while limiting intakes of foods high in saturated fat and animal products, positively benefited the hearts' left ventricular function which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood throughout the body.The researchers evaluated the dietary and echocardiographic data of 2,512 participants of the Framingham Heart Study (Offspring Cohort), compared their MIND diet score to measures of cardiac structure and function and observed that a dietary pattern that emphasizes foods thought to promote the maintenance of neurocognitive health also mitigates cardiac remodeling.According to the researchers previous studies have highlighted the importance of diet as a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. 

- "Our findings highlight the importance of adherence to the MIND diet for a better cardiovascular health and further reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in the community," explained corresponding author Vanessa Xanthakis, PhD, assistant professor of medicine and biostatistics at BUSM and an Investigator for the Framingham Heart Study.Although Xanthakis acknowledges that following a healthy diet may not always be easy or fit with today's busy schedules, people should make a concerted effort to adhere to healthy eating to help lower risk of disease and achieve better quality of life.Fear of memory loss impacts well-being and quality of lifeTrinity College Dublin, February 23, 2021Research from the Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI) at Trinity College suggests that experiencing high levels of fear about dementia can have harmful effects on older adults' beliefs about their memory and general well-being.To date, few studies have measured the impact of dementia-related fear on daily functioning, despite its clinical relevance. 

- In this new study, published in the journal Aging and Mental Health, researchers investigated if fear of memory decline predicted increased memory failures and poorer quality of life in older adults.Dr. 

- Francesca Farina, Atlantic Fellow for Equity in Brain Health at GBHI, in collaboration with researchers at the University of Cambridge, University of Maastricht and Northwestern University developed a novel scale—known as the Fear of Memory Loss (FAM) scale—to capture different components of fear related to memory loss.Using the scale, healthy older adults aged 55+ were assessed with respect to the different dimensions of fear. 

- Understanding and tackling these fears will serve to promote brain health and well-being, and reduce societal stigma for people living with disease and their carers. 

- Furthermore, we found that synaptosomes enriched with fatty acids and incubated with QUIN or FeSO4 showed a significant oxidative damage reduction.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “Results suggest that EFAs, particularly EPA, improve membrane fluidity and confer antioxidant effect.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Soy intake is associated with lowering blood pressure in adults: A meta-analysis of randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trialsShiraz University of Medical Sciences (Iran), February 24, 2021Soy has several beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, results of clinical trial studies are equivocal. 

- He also has a background in medical law and in the 1980s was a research assistant at the Research Center for Medical and Pharmaceutical Law. 

- Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by abnormal aggregates of proteins, known as amyloid fibrils, and subsequent deposition in various tissues and organs, such as Alzheimer's disease, immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis.In previous studies, curcumin has been shown to suppress the aggregation and cytotoxicity of many amyloid proteins in vitro, such as amyloid ß (Aß), α-synuclein, transthyretin, and prion protein, and has also been reported to inhibit the deposition of Aß fibrils in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. 

- These findings demonstrate the novel agonistic effect of curcumin on PPARα, which is an important transcription factor for lipid metabolism, and may have far-reaching significance for the treatment of amyloidosis and other metabolic disorders.It was reported that high-fat diet supplement aggravates a variety of amyloid deposition including Aß in Alzheimer's disease model mice, but a link between lipid metabolism and the development of amyloidosis has not been completely established. 

- By focusing on the PPARα pathway, the group hope to provide an opportunity to reconsider the mechanism of the physiological effects of curcumin.In the next stage, the group would like to clarify how curcumin activates the PPARα signaling pathway in vitro and confirm whether the activation of PPARα can affect amyloid deposition on other types of amyloidosis in vivo (Alzheimer's disease, ATTR amyloidosis etc.). 

- As a future study, the group hopes to fully understand the molecular fluctuations of PPARα-activated cells and verify the effectiveness of interventions in these pathways for various metabolic diseases.Older women who ate more plant protein had lower risk of premature, dementia-related deathUniversity of Iowa, February 24, 2021Postmenopausal women who ate high levels of plant protein had lower risks of premature death, cardiovascular disease and dementia-related death compared with women who ate less plant proteins, according to new research published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association, an open access journal of the American Heart Association.Previous research has shown an association between diets high in red meat and cardiovascular disease risk, yet the data is sparse and inconclusive about specific types of proteins, the study authors say.In this study, researchers analyzed data from more than 100,000 postmenopausal women (ages 50 to 79) who participated in the national Women's Health Initiative study between 1993 and 1998; they were followed through February 2017. 

- During the study period, a total of 25,976 deaths occurred (6,993 deaths from cardiovascular disease; 7,516 deaths from cancer; and 2,734 deaths from dementia).Researchers noted the levels and types of protein women reported consuming, divided them into groups to compare who ate the least and who ate the most of each protein. 

- The median percent intake of total energy from plant protein in this population was 3.5% in the lowest quintile and 6.8% in the highest quintile.Among the key findings:Compared to postmenopausal women who had the least amount of plant protein intake, those with the highest amount of plant protein intake had a 9% lower risk of death from all causes, a 12% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 21% lower risk of dementia-related death.Higher consumption of processed red meat was associated with a 20% higher risk of dying from dementia.Higher consumption of unprocessed meat, eggs and dairy products was associated with a 12%, 24% and 11% higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, respectively.Higher consumption of eggs was associated with a 10% higher risk of death due to cancer.However, higher consumption of eggs was associated with a 14% lower risk of dying from dementia, while higher poultry consumption was associated with a 15% lower risk. 

- "It is important to note that dietary proteins are not consumed in isolation, so the interpretation of these findings could be challenging and should be based on consideration of the overall diet including different cooking methods," said Yangbo Sun, M.D., Ph.D., co-author of the study, a postdoctoral research scholar at the University of Iowa in Iowa City and currently an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center.The analysis also revealed that women who ate the highest amount of animal protein such as meat and dairy were more likely to be white and have a higher education and income, and they were more likely to be past smokers, drink more alcohol and be less physically active. 

- Moreover, these women were more likely to have Type 2 diabetes at the start of the study, a family history of heart attacks and a higher body mass index -- all risk factors for cardiovascular disease. 

- "Current dietary guidelines mainly focus on the total amount of protein, and our findings show that there may be different health influences associated with different types of protein foods. 

- Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS), recommend eating a variety of protein foods: low-fat meat, low-fat poultry, eggs, seafood, beans, peas, lentils, nuts, seeds and soy products including at least 8 ounces of cooked seafood per week.The AHA's 2020 Dietary Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Risk advisory notes that given the relatively high content of cholesterol in egg yolks, it remains advisable to limit intake. 

- In addition, the findings may not apply to younger women or men.Citrus Flavonoid May Help to Improve Metabolic and Inflammatory MarkersSao Paulo State University (Brazil), February 20, 2021The researchers from Sao Paulo State University and the US Horticultural Research Laboratory associated the citrus flavonoid with a significant reduction in levels of cholesterols and triglycerides which are markers of insulin resistance at low (10 and 25 mg/kg BW) and high ( 100 mg/kg BW) doses, with the best results being observed at 25 mg per kg of body weight.The study authors wrote, “Therefore, our results showed that low doses of dietary eriocitrin are able to counteract the deleterious effects of high-fat diet and prevent risk factors of metabolic syndrome and chronic disease related to obesity.”“Further, the use of lower doses may help to prevent unintended complications possibly occurring at much higher doses of potent antioxidant supplements such as eriocitrin.”“As a leading supplier of citrus flavonoids, we put great importance into the continual development of research into these powerful ingredients,” said Rob Brewster who is the President of Ingredients by Nature (IBN). 

- “Eriocitrin is not as commonly recognized as other fruit-derived flavonoids, but the science shows that it is a potent source of health support for a variety of health complications. 

- Additionally, serum glucose levels also significantly decreased by 25%, insulin levels by 35% in this same group.“Most studies on eriocitrin haven’t explored its effect on obesity induces metabolic disturbances and, because the global rate of obesity continues to increase, we felt that it was important to examine the topic further,” said the corresponding author Dr. Thais Cesar who is also an associate professor of nutrition at Sao Paulo State University. 

- Although some available therapies can ameliorate symptoms, aging-related lung failure is generally irreversible and is accompanied by high rates of morbidity and mortality due to increased disease risk, including development of COPD, with accompanying emphysema and chronic bronchitis.Using a rapidly aging mouse model, the research team investigated whether the accumulation of age-related degenerative changes in the lung could be slowed by inhaled RSL. 

- Treatment cohorts received either RSL or vehicle by intratracheal (IT) instillation monthly for three months. 

- One month following the final treatment, whole lung function and injury-related gene expression in AEC2 were assessed.The research team found that inhaled, prophylactic resveratrol treatments can slow the rate of lung function decline, alveolar enlargement and alveolar epithelial type 2 cell DNA damage that occurs in the early stages of lung aging. 

- They concluded that administration of resveratrol directly to the lungs may be an effective intervention for lung aging, which is a significant risk factor for development of chronic lung disease. 

- "Deficient magnesium levels prevalent in an older populationKathmandu Medical College (Nepal), February 19, 2021According to news reporting out of Kathmandu Medical College research stated, “Magnesium deficiency is common in the elderly and critically ill population and has been associated with a prolonged ICU stay. 

- The knowledge of hypomagnesemia is essential as it could have prognostic and therapeutic implications in the elderly population.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Kathmandu Medical College: “This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of hypomagnesemic in the elderly population visiting a tertiary care center. 

- Further multicentric studies with a greater sample size should be done in this field, which will benefit the elderly population.”Researchers identify mechanism by which exercise strengthens bones and immunityUniversity of Texas Medical Center, February 24, 2021Scientists at the Children's Medical Center Research Institute at UT Southwestern (CRI) have identified the specialized environment, known as a niche, in the bone marrow where new bone and immune cells are produced. 

- Together, these findings identify a new way that exercise strengthens bones and immune function.Researchers from the Morrison laboratorydiscovered that forces created from walking or running are transmitted from bone surfaces along arteriolar blood vessels into the marrow inside bones. 

- We know very little about how this environment changes or why these cells decrease with age," says Sean Morrison, Ph.D., the director of CRI and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. 

- "Past research has shown exercise can improve bone strength and immune function, and our study discovered a new mechanism by which this occurs. 

- Curious if he could reverse this trend, Shen put running wheels in the cages so that the mice could exercise. 

- He found the bones of these mice became stronger with exercise, while the number of Osteolectin-positive cells and lymphoid progenitors around the arterioles increased. 

- "We think we've found an important mechanism by which exercise promotes immunity and strengthens bones, on top of other mechanisms previously identified by others," says Morrison.Long-term iodine nutrition associated with longevity in older adults: a 20 year follow-up of the Randers-Skagen StudyAalborg University (Denmark), February 23, 2021According to news reporting originating in Aalborg, Denmark, research stated, “Iodine intake affects the occurrence of thyroid disorders. 

- Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effects of lycopene supplementation on serum IGF-1 levels and cardiovascular disease.MethodsThe literature published up to January 2020 was searched using the electronic databases Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Embase and Google Scholar.ResultsSeven qualified trials were included in the current meta-analysis. 

- Subgroup analysis revealed a significantly decrease in IGF-1 levels upon lycopene supplementation at doses ≥15 mg/d (WMD: −6.40 ng/mL), intervention period 15 mg/d, for
French maritime pine bark supplementation associated with improvements in diabetes complicationsTabriz University of Medical Sciences (Iran), February 24 2021.A randomized trial reported on February 18, 2021 in Complementary Therapies in Medicine resulted in improvement of several factors related to type 2 diabetes among men and women who were given supplements containing French maritime pine bark extract.The trial included 46 diabetics between the ages of 30 and 65 years who were recruited from March 2018 to April 2019. 

- Anthropometric factors, glycemic parameters, lipids and factors related to inflammation and kidney function were assessed at the beginning and end of the study.At eight weeks, waist circumference, waist to height ratio, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1, an inflammatory cell that contributes to atherosclerosis), and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (an early indicator of kidney disease) were lower at the end of the study among participants who received French maritime pine bark extract in comparison with the placebo. 

- Serum fasting blood glucose levels were also lower at the end of the study in the group that received the extract; however, the reduction was not considered significant.“There is a growing body of evidence that suggests pine bark extract supplementation has some potentially beneficial metabolic properties such as anti-diabetic and hypoglycemic effects,” Elham Navval-Esfahlan and colleagues wrote.“The present study indicated that daily supplementation with 100 mg of pine bark extract in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria had favorable effects on glycemic control, serum VCAM-1, and urinary albumin to creatine ratio level, as well as total cholesterol concentrations and abdominal obesity which could be helpful in the control of diabetes complications,” they concluded.Study finds association between supplementing with zinc and lower risk of Alzheimer's diseaseUniversity of Manchester (UK), February 22 2021.An epidemiologic study conducted at the University of Manchester found an association between zinc supplementation and a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease as well as a reduction in the progression of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients. 

- It was additionally determined that zinc deficiency accelerated memory deficits in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model compared to a control group, due to increased inflammation. 

- The findings were reported in an article appearing on February 17, 2021 in the Journal of Neuroscience.For the epidemiologic study, Jack Rivers-Auty and his associates utilized data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, which included 1,631 men and women who were cognitively normal or diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease. 

- Data obtained at the beginning of the study provided information concerning the use of nutritional supplements.Among those who reported supplementing with zinc, just 6% were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, in contrast with 26% of those who reported no supplement use. 

- “These data suggest that zinc deficiency is causally accelerating cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease and that these cognitive deficits are reversible,” Dr Rivers-Auty and colleagues wrote.“This research suggests that zinc status is linked to inflammatory reactivity and may be modified in people to reduce the risk and slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease,” they concluded.Study finds low folate, vitamin B12 associated with worse cognitive functionUniversity of Massachusetts, February 22, 2021According to news reporting from Lowell, Massachusetts, research stated, “There is evidence that low plasma vitamin B-12 and folate individually, as well as an imbalance of high folic acid and low vitamin B-12 status, may be associated with lower cognitive function. 

- We examined dietary and plasma folate and vitamin B12 status, and their interaction, in relation to cognitive function in a cohort of older Puerto Rican adults.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, “The design is cross-sectional, with 1408 participants from the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (mean SD age: 57.1 +/- 7.9 y).

- However, depending on the condition it’s associated with, treatment can be expensive. 

- But in a recent study, researchers at Kyoto University investigated a potential treatment for loss of appetite that’s both inexpensive and easy to administer. 

- The researchers believe that their study provides crucial information for identifying suitable compounds that can be used for the long-term treatment of appetite loss.Case Study Shows Cannabis Led To Remarkable Improvement In Childhood Autism Symptoms Caleo Health Clinic (Canada) and Alberta Children's Hospital, February 21, 2021 An extremely promising case study was recently published in the Journal of Medical Case Reports illustrating the positive effects of cannabis extract and its association with improved autism related behavioral symptoms. 

- According to the authors, “the pharmacological treatment for autism spectrum disorders is often poorly tolerated and has traditionally targeted associated conditions, with limited benefit for the core social deficits. 

- Researchers reported that the patient’s symptoms improved within six-months of treatment, and that he has maintained “positive effects on his behavioral symptoms, anxiety, sleep, and social deficits” since that time. 

- He became more motivated and energetic, starting his own vegetarian diet and exercise programs, ultimately losing 6.4 kg after starting CBE for a calculated BMI of 21.33 kg/m2. 

- “Further research is needed to elucidate the clinical role and underlying biological mechanisms of action of cannabidiol-based extract in patients with autism spectrum disorder.” According to a report in Norml, these finding back up previous research published last year by investigators at Tufts University in Boston who similarly reported that the oral administration of cannabis-based products is associated with improvements in autistic symptoms in patients with self-injurious behaviors and co-morbid epilepsy, Several small clinical trials – such as those reported here, here, here, and here – have also previously reported that plant-derived cannabis extracts are effective and well-tolerated in mitigating various symptoms in patients with ASD, including hyperactivity, seizures, anxiety, and rage attacks.High Homocysteine Levels May Increase Risk Of Heart Attack, Stroke, & Alzheimer’s Disease Temple University, February 14, 2021 There is a strong need for increased awareness, better prevention, detection, and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease with well over 5 million Americans currently suffering from this debilitating brain-wasting disease, and this number is projected to triple over the next few decades Research has found a link between Alzheimer’s disease and elevated levels of homocysteine. 

- A report published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease classified elevated homocysteine as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and cognitive decline. 

- The recent study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry describes the dangers of B-complex vitamin shortfalls in relation to homocysteine which is produced in the body in response to the breakdown of proteins and is normally detoxified by B-complex vitamins. 

- Mice were deprived of vitamins B6, B9, and B12 for eight months, the animals were found to display elevated levels of homocysteine and 50% more tau tangles in the brain. 

- Elevated levels of homocysteine are dangerous to those with existing cardiovascular disease. 

- A study involving over 3,000 participants with chronic heart disease found that elevated levels were associated with a 2.5 fold increased risk for coronary events. 

- Experts suggest that a shortage in vitamins B2, B6, B9, and B12 that normally detoxify the amino acid are often the reason behind increasing levels of homocysteine. 

- If you are concerned about your levels of homocysteine, or vitamin levels consult with your physician or certified medical professionals who may be able to address your concerns with a simple blood test. 

- If you have reached or are approaching elderhood, with degenerative chronic conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and heart disease on the rise it may be better to err on the side of caution and get checked rather than guess. 

- Experts suggest that B complex vitamins are involved in breaking down homocysteine in the blood. 

- These vitamins can be supplemented, but it is always best to obtain them via natural sources such as is found in eating a diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. 

- Several of these human factors have big impacts on health and mortality: stress and early life adversity, psychiatric history, personality traits, intelligence, loneliness and social connection, and purpose in life are connected to a variety of late-life health outcomes, she explained. 

- Social factors associated with poor aging outcomes "Social hallmarks of aging" can be strongly predictive of age-related health outcomes - in many cases, even more so than biological factors, said USC University Professor and AARP Chair in Gerontology Eileen Crimmins. 

- Crimmins examined data that was collected in 2016 from the Health and Retirement Study, a large, nationally representative study of Americans over the age of 56 that incorporates both surveys regarding social factors and biological measurements, including a blood sample for genetic analysis. 

- For the study, she focused the five social hallmarks for poor health outcomes: low lifetime socioeconomic status, including lower levels of education adversity in childhood and adulthood, including trauma and other hardships being a member of a minority group adverse health behaviors, including smoking, obesity and problem drinking adverse psychological states, such as depression, negative psychological outlook and chronic stress The presence of these five factors were strongly associated with older adults having difficulty with activities of daily living, experiencing problems with cognition, and multimorbidity (having five or more diseases). 

- While acute responses to minor or moderate stressors, including infection or injury, is critical to survival, chronic exposure to high amounts of stress--including long-term psychological stressors such as abuse--can prove toxic and result in poor health outcomes. 

- For example, physiological hormetic stressors include short term exposure to cold, heat, exercise, or hypoxia. 

- Geroscience is now more important than ever, both to our aging global demography but also to the health challenges we face going forward, and stress resilience is an especially important topic at the moment, Epel added. 

- "Reducing social disparities, improving stress resilience and bolstering immune function have become critical public health goals." 

- The team found that although even the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables a day reduced disease risk, the greatest benefit came from eating 800g a day (roughly equivalent to ten portions - one portion of fruit or vegetables if defined as 80g). 

- The study, which was a meta-analysis of all available research in populations worldwide, included up to 2 million people, and assessed up to 43,000 cases of heart disease, 47,000 cases of stroke, 81,000 cases of cardiovascular disease, 112,000 cancer cases and 94,000 deaths. 

- The team also analysed which types of fruit and vegetables provided the greatest protection against disease. 

- Dr Dagfinn Aune, lead author of the research from the School of Public Health at Imperial explained: "We wanted to investigate how much fruit and vegetables you need to eat to gain the maximum protection against disease, and premature death. 

- The results revealed that even a daily intake of 200g was associated with a 16 per cent reduced risk of heart disease, an 18 per cent reduced risk of stroke, and a 13 per cent reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. 

- Eating up to 800g fruit and vegetables a day - or 10 portions - was associated with a 24 per cent reduced risk of heart disease, a 33 per cent reduced risk of stroke, a 28 per cent reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a 13 per cent reduced risk of total cancer, and a 31 per cent reduction in dying prematurely. 

- They found the following fruits and vegetables may help prevent heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and early death: apples and pears, citrus fruits, salads and green leafy vegetables such as spinach, lettuce and chicory, and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower. 

- Dr Aune said that several potential mechanisms could explain why fruit and vegetables have such profound health benefits: "Fruit and vegetables have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and to boost the health of our blood vessels and immune system. 

- The vast array of beneficial compounds cannot be easily replicated in a pill, he said: "Most likely it is the whole package of beneficial nutrients you obtain by eating fruits and vegetables that is crucial is health. 

- This is why it is important to eat whole plant foods to get the benefit, instead of taking antioxidant or vitamin supplements (which have not been shown to reduce disease risk)." 

- We also need more research on the relationship between fruit and vegetable intake with causes of death other than cancer and cardiovascular disease. 

- "Alpha-lipoic acid an effective antioxidant for healthy adult dogs Hills Pet Nutrition Research, February 19, 2021 According to news reporting originating from the Hill’s Pet Nutrition research stated, “This study was designed to determine the effect of alpha-lipoic acid on the glutathione status in healthy adult dogs.” Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Hill’s Pet Nutrition: “Following a 15 month baseline period during which dogs were fed a food containing no alpha-lipoic acid, dogs were randomly allocated into four groups.

- Omega-3 supplements may reduce muscle soreness after exercise, study finds University of Westminster (UK), February 18, 2021 Researchers at the University of Westminster have found that taking omega-3 supplements may help to reduce muscle soreness after exercise. 

- The findings may be important for people who avoid exercise because of the soreness associated with it. 

- Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids that play important roles in our bodies and may provide a number of health benefits. 

- They have anti-inflammatory functions, can help maintain a healthy heart, reduce the risk of heart disease and may have incredible effects on brain and mental health. 

- Previous studies have looked at the effect of omega-3 fish oils on muscle damage recovery and muscle inflammation following exercise. 

- Whilst evidence is mixed, it has been shown that sustained omega-3 intake in your diet may lead to small gains in recovery for athletes following intense exercise and possibly small gains in exercise performance too. 

- They then took part in a very intense exercise program aimed at causing severe muscle pain and physiologically safe muscle damage. 

- They found a lower inflammatory response and decreased muscle damage after exercise in the fish oil group. 

- Talking about the study, Ph.D. researcher and lead author Yvoni Kyriakidou, from the University of Westminster's School of Life Sciences, said: "Whilst the omega-3 supplementation didn't seem to enhance performance, it did reduce the pain participants experienced which we suggest is useful in itself as people don't like exercise because it hurts. 

- Higher intake of carotenoid beta cryptoxanthin associated with lower risk of osteoporosis Seoul National University (South Korea), February 12, 2021 According to news reporting out of Seoul, South Korea, research stated, “Many studies have analyzed the effects of * * b* * -cryptoxanthin (BCX) on osteoporosis and bone health. 

- For a new study, now published in the journal eLife, researchersset out to learn whether a composite biological clock outperforms individual biological clocks in predicting health. 

- “To develop a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying biological aging, we wanted to examine how indicators of biological aging relate to each other, how they link to determinants of physical and mental health, and whether a combined biological clock, made up of all age indicators, is a better predictor of health,” says co-lead author Dr. Rick Jansen, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at Amsterdam UMC, in the Netherlands. 

- The participants were recruited from medical facilities and the general population between September 2004 and February 2007. 

- The team used computer modeling to examine whether five measures of biological aging — telomere length and the epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic clocks — were interrelated and associated with mental and physical health. 

- The researchers then took the five indicators and incorporated them into an analysis that also included sex, lifestyle factors, physical ability, and known health conditions. 

- However, they could not determine whether this was due to the medication itself or the underlying physical or mental illness requiring treatment. 

- They write: “This provides further support for the hypothesis that not one biological clock sufficiently captures the biological aging process and that not all clocks are under the control of one unitary aging process.” Vitamin B3 prevents glaucoma in laboratory mice Jackson Laboratory, February 16, 2021 In mice genetically predisposed to glaucoma, vitamin B3 added to drinking water is effective at preventing the disease, a research team led by Jackson Laboratory Professor and Howard Hughes Medical Investigator Simon W.M. 

- "We wanted to identify key age-related susceptibility factors that change with age in the eye," John says, "and that therefore increase vulnerability to disease and in particular neuronal disease." 

- By understanding general age-related mechanism, there is the potential to develop new interventions to generally protect from common age-related disease processes in many people. 

- "The amount of failure will increase over time, resulting in more damage and disease progression." 

- "So gene therapy could be a one-shot, protective treatment." 

- He notes that gene therapies, through injections into the eye, have been approved for a handful of very rare, human genetic eye disorders, and their demonstration of an important age-dependent factor may enable gene therapy for more common eye disease. 

- John says that the team is pursuing clinical partnerships to begin the process of testing the effectiveness of vitamin B3 treatment in glaucoma patients. 

- They are also exploring potential applications for the treatment in other diseases involving neurodegeneration. 

- Even short periods of being sedentary is bad for your heart, caution researchers University of Liverpool, February 18, 2021 Researchers from the University of Liverpool in the U.K. found that short periods of being sedentary can worsen cardiometabolic health. 

- Increased sedentary behavior worsens cardiometabolic health It’s no secret that physical inactivity is bad for health. 

- For some reason, however, some participants failed to return to quite the same level of exercise they had engaged in prior to the study.

- The team focused, in particular, on longitudinal data from a cohort of over 900 community-dwelling older individuals (78-98 years old), allowing them to track health and survival outcomes.The data showed that gut microbiomes became increasingly unique (i.e. 

- "Interestingly, this uniqueness pattern appears to start in mid-life - 40-50 years old - and is associated with a clear blood metabolomic signature, suggesting that these microbiome changes may not simply be diagnostic of healthy aging, but that they may also contribute directly to health as we age," Wilmanski said. 

- "Prior results in microbiome-aging research appear inconsistent, with some reports showing a decline in core gut genera in centenarian populations, while others show relative stability of the microbiome up until the onset of aging-related declines in health," said microbiome specialist Dr. Sean Gibbons, co-corresponding author of the paper. 

- "Our work, which is the first to incorporate a detailed analysis of health and survival, may resolve these inconsistencies. 

- "This analysis highlights the fact that the adult gut microbiome continues to develop with advanced age in healthy individuals, but not in unhealthy ones, and that microbiome compositions associated with health in early-to-mid adulthood may not be compatible with health in late adulthood. 

- "This is exciting work that we think will have major clinical implications for monitoring and modifying gut microbiome health throughout a person's life," said ISB Professor Dr. Nathan Price, co-corresponding author of the paper.Rosmarinic acid suppresses cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease mouse modelUniversity of Tokyo (Japan), February 15, 2021According to news originating from the University of Tokyo , research stated, “Rosmarinic acid (RA), a polyphenol found in Lamiaceae herbs, is a candidate of preventive ingredients against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as it potently suppresses the aggregation of amyloid b (Ab); however, the effect of RA on tau phosphorylation and cognitive dysfunction remains unclear.”Financial supporters for this research include Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development; Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program.The news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Tokyo: “The present study revealed that RA intake inhibited the pathological hallmarks of AD, including Ab and phosphorylated tau accumulation, and improved cognitive function in the 3 x Tg-AD mouse model.

- They also uncovered preliminary evidence linking napping habits to cardiometabolic healthNapping is somewhat controversial,” says Hassan Saeed Dashti, Ph.D., RD, of the MGH Center for Genomic Medicine, co-lead author of the report with Iyas Daghlas, a medical student at Harvard Medical School (HMS). 

- The goal of a GWAS is to identify genetic variations that are associated with a specific disease or, in this case, habit.For this study, the MGH researchers and their colleagues used data from the UK Biobank, which includes genetic information from 452,633 people. 

- Some of these subtypes were linked to cardiometabolic health concerns, such as large waist circumference and elevated blood pressure, though more research on those associations is needed. 

- “This pathway is known to be involved in rare sleep disorders like narcolepsy, but our findings show that smaller perturbations in the pathway can explain why some people nap more than others,” says Daghlas.One or more soda a day could decrease chances of getting pregnantBoston University School of Public Health,  February 13, 2021The amount of added sugar in the American diet has increased dramatically over the last 50 years. 

- While consumption of these beverages has been linked to weight gain, type 2diabetes, early menstruation, and poor semen quality, few studies have directly investigated the relationship between sugary drinks and fertility.Now, a new study led by Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) researchers has found that the intake of one or more sugar-sweetened beverages per day—by either partner—is associated with a decreased chance of getting pregnant.The study was published in Epidemiology. 

- "Couples planning a pregnancy might consider limiting their consumption of these beverages, especially because they are also related to other adverse health effects. 

- Participants completed a comprehensive baseline survey on medical history, lifestyle factors, and diet, including their intake of sugar-sweetened beverages.

- The health benefits of cucumbers are many, and one of them seems to be better memory and even the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease.Researchers working with mice that normally developed the symptoms of Alzheimer’s (including memory loss) discovered that a daily dose of a flavonol called fisetin prevented these and other related impairments. 

- However, its ability to prevent memory loss associated with Alzheimer’s disease could have profound implications for humans.Cucumbers protect the brain from inflammationFisetin works by switching on a cellular pathway associated with the process of retrieving memories in the brain. 

- It was found that this potent compound has both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects on brain cells.The list of health benefits of cucumbers, strawberries and other fruits and vegetables containing fisetin now include brain and memory improvements. 

- By extension, fisetin has properties that can be highly beneficial for those at risk for Alzheimer’s.Other health benefits of cucumbersIn addition to improving memory and potentially protecting against Alzheimer’s, the cucumber fruit has a range of additional nutritional and health benefits. 

- They also provide flavonoids, triterpenes and lignans which offer anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cancer-preventing benefits.The peel and seeds in cucumbers contain beta-carotene for eye health and are the most nutrient-dense portions of the fruit. 

- Other vitamins include potassium, vitamin C, magnesium and manganese.Testosterone levels increased significantly after DHEA administration among older womenJiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, February 14, 2021According to news originating from Jiangxi, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Despite the fact that numerous clinical studies have evaluated the positive effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on testosterone concentrations and on the body mass index (BMI), more evidence is needed to certify that DHEA is a BMI-reducing agent in the elderly. 

- In addition, DHEA administration significantly decreased the BMI (WMD:-0.39 kg/m(2), I-2 = 0.0 %).”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “The results of the current meta-analysis support the use of DHEA supplementation for increasing testosterone concentrations in elderly women.”This research has been peer-reviewed.How healthy lifestyle behaviours can improve cholesterol profilesHarvard School of Public Health, February 15, 2021Combining healthy lifestyle interventions reduces heart disease through beneficial effects on different lipoproteins and associated cholesterols, according to a study published February 9 in eLife.Having a healthy lifestyle has long been associated with a lower risk of developing heart disease. 

- The new study provides more detailed information on how healthy lifestyles improve cholesterol, and suggests that combining cholesterol-lowering medications and lifestyle interventions may yield the greatest benefits to heart health.Cholesterol-lowering medications such as statins help reduce heart risks by lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the so-called "bad" cholesterol. 

- Chan School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, US.To address this gap, Si and colleagues used a technique called targeted nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure 61 different lipid markers in blood samples from 4,681 participants in the China Kadoorie Biobank, including cases of stroke, coronary heart disease and healthy individuals. 

- They found 50 lipid markers associated with a healthy lifestyle.When the team looked at a subset of 927 individuals who had coronary heart disease in the next 10 years and 1,513 healthy individuals, they found 35 lipid markers that showed statistically significant mediation effects in the pathway from healthy lifestyles to the reduction of heart disease. 

- Together, the combined beneficial effects of the lipid changes associated with healthy lifestyle practices were linked to a 14% reduced risk of heart disease. 

- Chan School of Public Health. 

- "Our analysis confirmed that cholesterol-lowering drugs would have the expected effect in lowering LDL cholesterol, but this is much weaker compared to the effect of healthy behaviours on VLDL cholesterol which also increases the risk of heart disease. 

- "Lifestyle interventions and lipid-lowering medications may affect different components of the lipid profile, suggesting they are not redundant strategies but could be combined for improved benefits," concludes co-senior author Jun Lv, Professor at the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the School of Public Health, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.Role of Diet in Colorectal Cancer IncidenceUmbrella Review of Meta-analyses of Prospective Observational StudiesUniversity of Utah, February 16Question  How credible is the evidence behind the association of dietary factors with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in published meta-analyses of prospective observational studies?Findings  This umbrella review of 45 meta-analyses describing 109 associations found convincing evidence for an association between lower CRC risk and higher intakes of dietary fiber, dietary calcium, and yogurt and lower intakes of alcohol and red meat.Meaning  This study suggests that dietary factors may have a role in the development and prevention of CRC, but more research is needed on specific foods for which the evidence remains suggestive.AbstractImportance  Several meta-analyses have summarized evidence for the association between dietary factors and the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). 

- The results of the study provide information on the earliest changes in the metabolism of the liver that in the long term lead to fatty liver disease in overweight persons as well as in those with type 2 diabetes.In the current issue of the "Journal of Clinical Investigation", DZD researchers working at the German Diabetes Center, in conjunction with the Helmholtz Center in Munich and colleagues from Portugal, published a scientific investigation conducted on healthy, slim men, who were given at random a flavored palm oil drink or a glass of clear water in a control experiment. 

- The observed metabolic changes were similar to changes observed in persons with type 2diabetes or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 

- NAFLD is the most common liver disease in the industrial nations and associated with obesity, the so-called "metabolic syndrome," and is associated with an increased risk in developing type 2 diabetes. 

- The increased availability of fat leads to an increased workload for the mitochondria, which can in the long term overtax these cellular power plants and contribute to the emergence of a liver disease.The team of Prof. Roden suspects that healthy people, depending on genetic predisposition, can easily manage this direct impact of fatty food on the metabolism.

- I do not have medical expertise. 

- Quote:“The damage done by the science functionaries is immense.“Incidentally, there are currently several statements by medical practitioners that are diametrically opposed to the Leopoldina paper. 

- For example, the Chairman of the Board of the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, Prof. Gassen, expects that the hard lockdown now ordered will fail (3).

- “We asked whether sulforaphane may influence the lifespan and health span of C. elegans.”Adding sulforaphane to the worms’ diets increased the lifespan of various strains of C. elegans by an average of 17%. 

- )Sulforaphane also increased health span, resulting in a delay in aging-associated physiologic decline. 

- "We are the first to report that sulforaphane prolongs the lifespan and increases the health span of C. elegans through the inhibition of DAF- 2/insulin/IGF-1 signaling and the activation of DAF- 16/FOXO nuclear transcription in C. elegans,” the authors announced. 

- Scientists at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) have now transferred these results to the situation in Germany and calculated: If all Germans over the age of 50 were to take vitamin D supplements, up to 30,000 cancer deaths per year could possibly be avoided and more than 300,000 years of life could be gained - in addition, health care costs could be saved.For several years now, scientists have been investigating the influence of an adequate supply of vitamin D on the prognosis of numerous diseases. 

- In 2016, approximately 36 million people over the age of 50 lived in Germany, resulting in annual supplementation costs of 900 million euros.The researchers took the cost of cancer treatment from the scientific literature, assuming mean additional treatment costs of €40,000 for the last year of life. 

- A 13 percent reduction in cancer mortality in Germany corresponded to approximately 30,000 fewer cancer-related deaths per year, the treatment costs of which amounted to €1.154 billion in the model calculation. 

- Not to mention that there is mounting evidence of other positive health effects of adequate vitamin D supply, such as in lung disease mortality rates," says Brenner, adding, "Finally, we consider vitamin D supplementation so safe that we even recommend it for newborn babies to develop healthy bones.

- "This research supports the hypothesis that improving people's fitness may improve their brain health and slow down the aging process," said Dr. Kan Ding, a neurologist from the Peter O'Donnell Jr. 

- Brain Institute who authored the study.White matterThe study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease focused on a type of brain tissue called white matter, which is comprised of millions of bundles of nerve fibers used by neurons to communicate across the brain.Dr. 

- Ding's team enrolled older patients at high risk to develop Alzheimer's disease who have early signs of memory loss, or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 

- Scientists also used brain imaging to measure the functionality of each patient's white matter.Patients were then given memory and other cognitive tests to measure brain function, allowing scientists to establish strong correlations between exercise, brain health, and cognition.Lingering mysteriesThe study adds to a growing body of evidence pointing to a simple yet crucial mandate for human health: Exercise regularly.However, the study leaves plenty of unanswered questions about how fitness and Alzheimer's disease are intertwined. 

- Is it too late to intervene when patients begin showing symptoms?Some of these topics are already being researched through a five-year national clinical trial led by the O'Donnell Brain Institute.The trial, which includes six medical centers across the country, aims to determine whether regular aerobic exercise and taking specific medications to reduce high blood pressure and cholesterol levels can help preserve brain function. 

- It involves more than 600 older adults at high risk to develop Alzheimer's disease. 

- We need studies like this to find out how the two are intertwined and hopefully find the right formula to help prevent Alzheimer's disease," said Dr. Rong Zhang of UT Southwestern, who oversees the clinical trial and is Director of the Cerebrovascular Laboratory in the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, where the Dallas arm of the study is being carried out.Prior findingsThe research builds upon prior investigations linking healthy lifestyles to better brain function, including a 2013 study from Dr. Zhang's team that found neuronal messages are more efficiently relayed in the brains of older adults who exercise.In addition, other teams at the O'Donnell Brain Institute are designing tests for the early detection of patients who will develop dementia, and seeking methods to slow or stop the spread of toxic proteins associated with the disease such as beta-amyloid and tau, which are blamed for destroying certain groups of neurons in the brain.

- "This study sheds light on how all these triggers can lead to herpes simplex-associated disease. 

- HSV infection has also been linked to the progression of Alzheimer's disease.Recurrences of HSV are typically associated with stress, illness or sunburn, but doctors have been uncertain exactly what causes the virus to reactivate.Cliffe and her collaborators found that when neurons harboring the virus were exposed to stimuli that induce "neuronal hyperexcitation," the virus senses this particular change and seizes its opportunity to reactivate.Working in a model developed by the Cliffe lab using mouse neurons infected with HSV, the researchers determined that the virus hijacks an important immune response within the body. 

- "The scientists say that more research will need to be done to fully understand the potential factors which play into herpes simplex disease.

- The link between aerobic fitness and cognitionUniversity of Tsukuba (Japan), February 3, 2021Although exercise is known to enhance cognitive function and improve mental health, the neurological mechanisms of this link are unknown. 

- Now, researchers from Japan have found evidence of the missing link between aerobic fitness and cognitive function.In a study published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, researchers from the University of Tsukuba revealed that spontaneous eye blink rate (sEBR), which reflects activity of the dopamine system, could be used to understand the connection between cognitive function and aerobic fitness.The dopaminergic system is known to be involved in physical activity and exercise, and previous researchers have proposed that exercise-induced changes in cognitive function might be mediated by activity in the dopaminergic system. 

- This information provides new directions for research regarding how fitness affects the brain, which may lead to improved exercise regimens. 

- For instance, exercise that specifically focuses on improving dopaminergic function may particularly boost motivation, mood, and mental function.Vegan diet better for weight loss and cholesterol control than Mediterranean dietPhysicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, February 5, 2021A vegan diet is more effective for weight loss than a Mediterranean diet, according to a groundbreaking new study that compared the diets head to head. 

- The randomized crossover trial, which was published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, found that a low-fat vegan diet has better outcomes for weight, body composition, insulin sensitivity, and cholesterol levels, compared with a Mediterranean diet.The study randomly assigned participants–who were overweight and had no history of diabetes–to a vegan diet or a Mediterranean diet in a 1:1 ratio. 

- Neither group had a calorie limit, and participants did not change exercise or medication routines, unless directed by their personal doctors. 

- “We decided to test the diets head to head and found that a vegan diet is more effective for both improving health markers and boosting weight loss.”The authors note that the vegan diet likely led to weight loss, because it was associated with a reduction in calorie intake, increase in fiber intake, decrease in fat consumption, and decrease in saturated fat consumption.“While many people think of the Mediterranean diet as one of the best ways to lose weight, the diet actually crashed and burned when we put it to the test,” says study author Neal Barnard, MD, president of the Physicians Committee. 

- Most of these microorganisms are found in the intestines, and most of them are helpful, stimulating the immune system, breaking down food and helping synthesize key vitamins.In a healthy body, there is a balance of pathogenic and beneficial organisms. 

- However, if the balance is disturbed, either through the use of antibiotics, illness, or unhealthy diet, the body could become susceptible to disease.In this study, Garland’s team looked for impacts on the microbiome after dividing their mice into four groups: half fed the standard, ‘healthy’ diet, half fed the less healthy ‘Western’ diet, half with access to a running wheel for exercise, and half without.After three weeks spent on these diets, all mice were returned to a standard diet and no exercise, which is normally how mice are kept in a laboratory. 

- This type of bacteria is involved in carbohydrate metabolism.Analysis also showed that the gut bacteria are sensitive to the amount of exercise the mice got. 

- Muribaculum bacteria increased in mice fed a standard diet who had access to a running wheel and decreased in mice on a high-fat diet whether they had exercise or not.Researchers believe this species of bacteria, and the family of bacteria that it belongs to, might influence the amount of energy available to its host. 

- Research continues into other functions that this type of bacteria may have.One other effect of note was the increase in a highly similar bacteria species that were enriched after five weeks of treadmill training in a study by other researchers, suggesting that exercise alone may increase its presence.Overall, the UCR researchers found that early-life Western diet had more long-lasting effects on the microbiome than did early-life exercise.Garland’s team would like to repeat this experiment and take samples at additional points in time, to better understand when the changes in mouse microbiomes first appear, and whether they extend into even later phases of life.Regardless of when the effects first appear, however, the researchers say it’s significant that they were observed so long after changing the diet, and then changing it back.The takeaway, Garland said, is essentially, “You are not only what you eat, but what you ate as a child!”Turns Out Maple Syrup Is AnticarcinogenicKindai University (Japan), February 2, 2021Darker coloured syrup is suggested as healthier than lightly coloured syrup.Maple syrup is a classic natural sweetener that has been making a comeback recently as an alternative to refined sugar.

- It’s also the basis of brain training, an approach that holds potential as a non-invasive therapy to overcome disabilities caused by neurological disease or trauma.Research at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital of McGill University (The Neuro) has shown just how adaptive the brain can be, knowledge that could one day be applied to recovery from conditions such as stroke.Researchers Dave Liu and Christopher Pack have demonstrated that practice can change the way that the brain uses sensory information. 

- This is something we’re starting to work on now.”Higher Fiber Intake May Improve Lung FunctionUniversity of Nebraska, January 28, 2021Eating a fiber-rich diet may help protect you against lung disease, a new study suggests.“Lung disease is an important public health problem, so it’s important to identify modifiable risk factors for prevention,” study author Corrine Hanson, an associate professor of medical nutrition at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said in a journal news release.“However, beyond smoking very few preventative strategies have been identified. 

- Increasing fiber intake may be a practical and effective way for people to have an impact on their risk of lung disease,” she added.The findings were published recently in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society.Researchers looked at federal government data from almost 2,000 American adults. 

- They had larger lung capacity and could exhale more air in one second, the study said.Although the study found a link between fiber consumption and better lung health, it wasn’t designed to prove a cause-and-effect relationship.But, if the findings are confirmed in future studies, public health campaigns may one day “target diet and fiber as safe and inexpensive ways of preventing lung disease,” Hanson said.Previous research has suggested a diet high in fiber protects against heart disease and diabetes, and that fiber reduces inflammation in the body, the researchers said.

- Subjects’ plasma or serum magnesium concentrations were obtained at the beginning of the studies and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events, and/or other outcomes were documented during follow-up periods that varied from an average of 11.7 months to 278 months.Each 0.1 millimole per liter increase in magnesium was associated with a 15% lower risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event or dying from cardiovascular disease, and a 10% lower risk of dying from any cause during follow-up. 

- “In these trials, the intervention should ideally consist of an increase of dialysate magnesium in patients on dialysis, and dietary intervention or oral magnesium…in patients with CKD not on dialysis,” they recommended.Bleeding gums may be a sign you need more vitamin C in your dietUniversity of Washington, February 1, 2021Current advice from the America Dental Association tells you that if your gums bleed, make sure you are brushing and flossing twice a day because it could be a sign of gingivitis, an early stage of periodontal disease. 

- And vitamin C deficiency is one possible reason," said the study's lead author Philippe Hujoel, a practicing dentist and professor of oral health sciences in the UW School of Dentistry.Hujoel's study, published Feb. 1 in Nutrition Reviews, analyzed published studies of 15 clinical trials in six countries, involving 1,140 predominantly healthy participants, and data from 8,210 U.S. residents surveyed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. 

- And, the researchers found that increasing daily intake of vitamin C in those people with low vitamin C plasma levels helped to reverse these bleeding issues.Of potential relevance, says Hujoel, who is also an adjunct professor of epidemiology in the UW School of Public Health, both a gum bleeding tendency and retinal bleeding could be a sign of general trouble in one's microvascular system, of a microvascular bleeding tendency in the brain, heart and kidneys.The study does not imply that successful reversing of an increased gingival bleeding tendency with vitamin C will prevent strokes or other serious health outcomes, Hujoel stresses. 

- However, the results do suggest that vitamin C recommendations designed primarily to protect against scurvy -- a deadly disease caused by extremely low vitamin C levels -- are too low, and that such a low vitamin C intake can lead to a bleeding tendency, which should not be treated with dental floss.Consequently, Hujoel does recommend people attempt to keep an eye on their vitamin C intake through incorporation of non-processed foods such as kale, peppers or kiwis into your diet, and if you can't find palatable foods rich in vitamin C to consider a supplement of about 100 to 200 milligrams a day.If someone is on a specialized diet, such as a paleo diet, it's important that they take a look at their vitamin C intake, Hujoel said. 

- "So, missing the possible connection between gum bleeding and low levels of vitamin C has the potential to have serious health consequences.The study authors write: "A default prescription of oral hygiene and other periodontal interventions to 'treat' microvascular pathologies, even if partially effective in reversing gingival bleeding as suggested in this meta-analysis, is risky because it does not address any potential morbidity and mortality associated with the systemic microvascular-related pathologies. 

- A new study, led by Bar-Ilan University's Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, reveals that antibiotic treatment within 14 days of birth is associated with reduced weight and height in boys - but not girls -- up to the age of six.By contrast, the study showed significantly higher body mass index (BMI) in both boys and girls following antibiotic use after the neonatal period, and within the first six years of life.The findings, published in the journal Nature Communications on January 26, 2021, may be the result of changes in the development of the gut microbiome.The impact of neonatal antibiotic exposure was investigated in a cohort of 12,422 children born between 2008-2010 at the Turku University Hospital in Turku, Finland. 

- The babies had no genetic abnormalities or significant chronic disorders affecting growth and did not need long-term antibiotic treatment. 

- Antibiotics had been administered within the first 14 days of life to 1,151 (9.3%) of the neonates in the study.The authors found that boys exposed to antibiotic treatment exhibited significantly lower weight as compared to non-exposed children throughout the first six years. 

- Our results suggest that their use may also have unwanted long-term consequences which need to be considered," said Prof. Omry Koren, of the Azrieli Faculty of Medicine of Bar-Ilan University, who led the study together with Prof. Samuli Rautava, of the University of Turku and University of Helsinki.Follow up research will aim to investigate other potential adverse outcomes related to neonatal antibiotic exposure.Ten Days of Curcumin Supplementation Attenuates Subjective Soreness and Maintains Muscular Power Following Plyometric ExerciseOhio University, February 1, 2021Curcumin has become a popular product used to decrease inflammation and enhance recovery from exercise. 

- Purpose: To determine the effects of curcumin supplementation on delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle power following plyometric exercise. 

- Methods: Participants (n = 22; five females, 17 males) consumed either curcumin (500 mg) or placebo twice daily for 10 days (6 days pre, day of and 3 days post exercise). 

- Blood sampling and recovery tests were assessed at pre-supplementation, 24-hours and immediately pre-exercise, and immediately post-, 24, 48 and 72-hours post-exercise.

- Data were analyzed using the SPSS software through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, chi-squared, t-test, and repeated measures ANOVA.ResultsThe results showed clinical symptoms decreased in both groups during the study and both medications were effective in the treatment of HSV-1. 

- The treatment course for participants in the OLE group was shorter than in the acyclovir group (P = 0.001).ConclusionThe evidence from these trials suggests the OLE cream is superior in the healing of episodes of HSV-1 over the acyclovir cream. 

- Future studies are recommended to investigate if OLE could be an adjunct to acyclovir treatment.How vitamins, steroids and potential antivirals might affect SARS-CoV-2Study indicates that some vitamins, steroids and antivirals could bind to the Spike protein, and may inhibit virus infectivity, whereas high cholesterol may enable the virusUniversity of Bristol (UK), January 29, 2021Evidence is emerging that vitamin D - and possibly vitamins K and A - might help combat COVID-19. 

- In contrast, cholesterol may increase infectivity, which could explain why having high cholesterol is considered a risk factor for serious disease.Recently, Bristol researchers showed that linoleic acid binds to a specific site in the viral spike protein, and that by doing so, it locks the spike into a closed, less infective form. 

- New anti-viral drugs can take years to design, develop and test, so the researchers looked through a library of approved drugs and vitamins to identify those which might bind to this recently discovered 'druggable pocket' inside the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.The team first studied the effects of linoleic acid on the spike, using computational simulations to show that it stabilizes the closed form. 

- Further simulations showed that dexamethasone - which is an effective treatment for COVID-19 - might also bind to this site and help reduce viral infectivity in addition to its effects on the human immune system.The team then conducted simulations to see which other compounds bind to the fatty acid site. 

- These have the potential to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and may help to prevent cell entry.The simulations also predicted that the fat-soluble vitamins D, K and A bind to the spike in the same way making the spike less able to infect cells.Dr Deborah Shoemark, Senior Research Associate (Biomolecular Modelling) in the School of Biochemistry, who modelled the spike, explained: "Our findings help explain how some vitamins may play a more direct role in combatting COVID than their conventional support of the human immune system. 

- Our research suggests that some essential vitamins and fatty acids including linoleic acid may contribute to impeding the spike/ACE2 interaction. 

- They also show that drugs and vitamins active against the virus may work in the same way. 

- This study, which builds on previous studies by Millet-Boureima and Gamberi, was co-authored by Roman Rozencwaig and Felix Polyak of BH Bioscience in Montreal.The researchers hope that their findings can be applied to treating people suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. 

- ADPKD is a genetic chronic and progressive disease characterized by the growth of dozens of cysts in the nephrons. 

- The researchers realized that they could potentially develop targeted treatment depending on the location of the cysts in a patient's nephrons. 

- PKD is a chronic disease, so treatment cannot include any toxic components. 

- "I hope there will be more research on the drugs we tested and that we get more results that will help the PKD community," Millet-Boureima says.Gallic acid is a dual alpha/beta-secretase modulator that reverses cognitive impairment and remediates pathology in AlzheimerSaitama Medical Center (Japan), January 20, 2021According to news reporting from Saitama, Japan, research stated, “Several plant-derived compounds have demonstrated efficacy in pre-clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) rodent models. 

- Each of these compounds share a gallic acid (GA) moiety, and initial assays on this isolated molecule indicated that it might be responsible for the therapeutic benefits observed.”  Higher concentrations of GA are found in blueberry, blackberry, strawberry, plums, grapes, mango, cashew nut, hazelnut, walnut and tea.The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Saitama Medical Center, “To test this hypothesis in a more physiologically relevant setting, we investigated the effect of GA in the mutant human amyloid beta-protein precursor/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD mouse model. 

- Thus, our data reveal novel post-translational mechanisms for GA.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “We suggest further examination of GA supplementation in humans will shed light on the exciting therapeutic potential of this molecule.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Black cumin’s anti-inflammatory potential may have airways/asthma benefits: RCTUniversity College London, January 27, 2021Supplements containing oil from black cumin (Nigella sativa) may improve asthma control and lung function, says a new study.The seed and oil of Nigella sativa have been used extensively in traditional medicine in many Middle Eastern and Asian countries for the treatment of a range of conditions, including some immune and inflammatory disorders.The new study, published in Phytotherapy Research , found that one gram per day of the oil for four weeks led to significant improvements in scores of asthma control and a “remarkable reduction of peripheral blood eosinophil count,” wrote the authors“Eosinophil cell plays a major role in asthma inflammation, and blood eosinophil count is considered to be a vital biomarker in asthma trials.

Pooled data for the two studies involving amino acid supplements, seven studies involving melatonin, and four studies involving vitamin D each showed significant differences between supplemented and control groups, with more favorable PSQI scores occurring among those who received the supplements. 

- The two studies that evaluated omega 3 did not reveal significant differences between the treatment and control groups.Two reviewed trials that were not eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis added evidence to the benefit of melatonin in sleep quality.

- In addition, researchers collected information about hospital admissions for different chronic physical diseases, ranging from coronary heart disease to cancer.Across the 30-year period, individuals with mental disorders were more likely to develop subsequent physical diseases and they also died earlier than people without mental disorders, the study showed. 

- They also experienced more medical hospitalizations, spent more time in hospitals for physical-disease treatment and accumulated more associated health care costs. 

- These associations were present across all age groups and in both men and women.The findings indicate that addressing mental health problems in early life might be a window of opportunity for preventing future physical diseases, Richmond-Rakerd said. 

- They also suggest the importance of joined-up services, or integrated care.“Our health care system often divides treatment between the brain and the body,” she said. 

- “Integrating the two could benefit population health.”Richmond-Rakerd said they chose New Zealand because there it is possible to link hospital registers and other administrative databases for the entire population of the country.The study’s co-authors are Stephanie D’Souza and Barry Milne of the University of Auckland, Avshalom Caspi and Terrie Moffitt of Duke University and King’s College London. 

- "How we think about who we're going to be in old age is very predictive of exactly how we will be," said Shelbie Turner, a doctoral student in OSU's College of Public Health and Human Sciences and co-author on the study.Previous studies on aging have found that how people thought about themselves at age 50 predicted a wide range of future health outcomes up to 40 years later -- cardiovascular events, memory, balance, will to live, hospitalizations; even mortality. 

- "Previous research has shown that people who have positive views of aging at 50 live 7.5 years longer, on average, than people who don't," said Karen Hooker, co-author of the study and the Jo Anne Leonard Petersen Endowed Chair in Gerontology and Family Studies at OSU.Because self-perceptions of aging are linked to so many major health outcomes, Hooker and Turner wanted to understand what influences those perceptions. 

- "People need to realize that some of the negative health consequences in later life might not be biologically driven. 

- "If you believe these bad things are going to happen, over time that can erode people's willingness or maybe even eventually their ability to engage in those health behaviors that are going to keep them as healthy as they can be. 

- "Over half of cannabis users with Parkinson's disease report clinical benefitsUniversity Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany), January 26, 2021With medicinal cannabis now legalized in many parts of the world, there is growing interest in its use to alleviate symptoms of many illnesses including Parkinson's disease (PD). 

- According to results of a survey of PD patients in Germany in the Journal of Parkinson's Disease, over 8% of patients with PD reported using cannabis products and more than half of those users (54%) reported a beneficial clinical effect.Cannabis products containing THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive compound of cannabis) can be prescribed in Germany when previous therapies are unsuccessful or not tolerated, and where cannabis can be expected with not a very unlikely chance to relieve disabling symptoms. 

- "Medical cannabis was legally approved in Germany in 2017 when approval was given for therapy-resistant symptoms in severely affected patients independent of diagnosis and without clinical evidence-based data," explained lead investigator Prof. Dr. med. 

- Carsten Buhmann, Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. 

- "PD patients fulfilling these criteria are entitled to be prescribed medical cannabis, but there are few data about which type of cannabinoid and which route of administration might be promising for which PD patient and which symptoms. 

- Questionnaires were sent out in April 2019 with the association's membership journal and were also distributed in the investigators' clinic.Over 1,300 questionnaires were analyzed; results showed that interest in the PD community in medical cannabis was high, but knowledge about different types of products was limited. 

- "Our data confirm that PD patients have a high interest in treatment with medicinal cannabis but lacked knowledge about how to take it and especially the differences between the two main cannabinoids, THC and CBD," noted Prof. Dr. med. 

- "Physicians should consider these aspects when advising their patients about treatment with medicinal cannabis. 

- It has to be stressed, though, that our findings are based on subjective patient reports and that clinically appropriate studies are urgently needed," he concluded.Bastiaan R. Bloem, MD, PhD, Director, Radboudumc Center of Expertise for Parkinson & Movement Disorders, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, and Co-Editor-in Chief of the Journal of Parkinson's Disease, added: "These findings are interesting in that they confirm a widespread interest among patients in the use of cannabis as a potential treatment for people living with PD. 

- It is important to emphasize that more research is needed before cannabis can be prescribed as a treatment, and that guidelines currently recommend against the use of cannabis, even as self-medication, because the efficacy is not well established, and because there are safety concerns (adverse effects include among others sedation and hallucinations). 

- As such, the present paper mainly serves to emphasize the need for carefully controlled clinical trials to further establish both the efficacy and safety of cannabis treatment. 

- "Covid lockdown loneliness linked to more depressive symptoms in older adultsUniversity of Exeter (UK), January 22, 2021Loneliness in adults aged 50 and over during the COVID-19 lockdown was linked to worsening depressive and other mental health symptoms, according to a large-scale online study.Loneliness emerged as a key factor linked to worsening symptoms of depression and anxiety in a study of more than 3,000 people aged 50 or over led by the University of Exeter and King's College London, and funded by The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) .Researchers had access to data going back to 2015 for participants of the PROTECT online study. 

- Other factors included being female and being retired.Dr Byron Creese, of the University of Exeter Medical School, who led the study, said: "Even before the pandemic, loneliness and physical activity levels were a huge issue in society, particularly among older people. 

- Our study enabled us to compare mental health symptoms before and after COVID-19 in a large group of people aged 50 and over. 

- We found that during lockdown, loneliness and decreased physical activity were associated with more symptoms of poor mental health, especially depression. 

- It's now crucial that we build on this data to find new ways to mitigate risk of worsening mental health during the pandemic. 

- In May, researchers included a new questionnaire designed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on health and wellbeing. 

- The study is continuing to run so that longer term outcomes can be assessed.Zunera Khan, Research Portfolio Lead at Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience said "We've found links between loneliness and a drop in physical exercise and worsening mental health symptoms. 

- "Professor Clive Ballard, Executive Dean and Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University of Exeter Medical School, who leads PROTECT, said: "We are only just beginning to learn the impact that COVID-19 is having on the health and wellbeing of older people. 

- Our large scale study will span a number of years, and will help us understand some of the longer-term effects of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing, and ultimately, on whether this has any knock-on effect on aspects of ageing, such as brain function and memory. 

- We have heard from Dr. McCullough how Covid disease progresses in phases, fromviral replication, to florid pneumonia to multi-organ attack. 

- We have also heard how each phase, each pathologic aspectof the disease, has to have its own specific treatments that apply to its own biologicmechanisms. 

- Thus, I was frankly astounded that studies of hospital treatments were beingrepresented as applying to outpatients, in violation of what I learned in medical school abouthow to treat patients.We are now finally coming to address why over the last six months, our government researchinstitutions have invested billions of dollars in expensive patent medication and vaccinedevelopment but almost nothing in early outpatient treatment, the first line of response tomanaging the pandemic. 

- But I believe that the early-on conflation of hospital withoutpatient disease served to imply that treatment of outpatient disease had been studied andfound ineffective. 

- This illogical premise motivated me to look at the evidence for outpatienttreatment.I reiterate: we are considering the evidence for early treatment of high-risk outpatients toprevent hospitalization and mortality. 

- Treatment starting in the first five days or soafter the onset of symptoms. 

- Treatment of older patients or patients with chronic conditionssuch as diabetes, obesity, heart diseases, lung diseases, kidney diseases, immune-systemdiseases, survivors of cancer etc. 

- I have sought to obtain reports of every study ofevery medication pertaining to early treatment of high-risk outpatients. 

- The idea thatonly randomized trials provide trustworthy evidence is a simplistic notion that may sound goodin theory, but the comparison between randomized and non-randomized trials is somethingthat has actually been extensively studied in the medical literature. 

- But Dr. Frieden’s essay, asauthoritative as it is, provides only snapshots of the empirical evidence for his observations.The real evidence comes from a meta-analysis of meta-analyses done by the Cochrane LibraryConsortium, a British international organization formed to organize medical research findings tofacilitate evidence-based choices about health interventions. 

- In fact, a study by researchers at theUniversity of Oxford showed that in 14 large international medical-records databases of olderrheumatoid arthritis patients, no significant differences were seen in all-cause mortality forpatients who did or did not use hydroxychloroquine. 

- All these studies pertain to the early treatment of high-risk outpatients—and allshowed about 50 percent or greater reductions in hospitalization or death. 

- But they all suggested lower risks withhydroxychloroquine use, and when they were analyzed together in meta-analysis as mycolleagues and I found, this lower risk was statistically significant across the studies.We have spent the last six months with formal government policies and warnings against earlyoutpatient treatment, with large government investments in vaccines and expensive newtreatments yet to be proven and almost no support of inexpensive but useful medications, anda quarter of a million Americans have died from this mismanaged approach. 

- This is how we will get on the road to early outpatient treatment and themajor curtailment of mortality.

- If we are to believe the World Health Organization’s and individual governments’ official statistics, the number of confirmed cases is reaching 100 million with over 2 million deaths. 

- It would be common sense, therefore, to expect, in fact demand, international health agencies and governments to make every effort to identify the virus’ origin. 

- Suspicions that the virus, now responsible for the spectrum of medical symptoms known as Covid-19, may have been bioengineered and escaped from a maximum security BSL-4 lab in Wuhan, China, were already voiced within a month after its identification was first reported. 

- Several highly respected medical experts, including Dr. David Relman at Stanford University, have suggested there is a strong likelihood that the virus escaped the Wuhan facility. 

- That year, many Russian medical scientists, including Moscow’s head epidemiologist Dr. Nikolai Filatov, shared their opinions that the first SARS outbreak originated from a bioweapons lab.In January 2020, less than a month since the first reported case in Wuhan, Dr. Igor Nikulin, a former member of the United Nation’s Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons, stated in an interview that the US has been funding biolaboratories throughout the world, such as Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Taiwan, Philippines, etc, and “wherever there are these American biolaboratories, or near them, there are outbreaks of new diseases, often unknown.” This was also confirmed by the founding president of EcoHealth Alliance, Dr. Peter Daszak, a fundamental player in the saga of “gain of function” research on coronavirus and other viral pathogens. 

- She has discovered that the majority of EcoHealth’s funding derives from the US Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health and Anthony Fauci. 

- Baden-Mayer’s probing inquiries uncovered a cabal of controversial figures, including Daszak, Baric and his Chinese colleague Dr. Shi Zheng-li at the Wuhan lab, Bill Gate’s Foundation director Scott Dowell, former Human and Health Services’ director Dr. Robert Kadlec and Anthony Fauci. 

- Franz serves as EcoHealth’s policy health advisor. 

- During the first SARS outbreak, the CDC in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report dated April 4, 2003 stated that “anyone showing signs of fever or respiratory symptoms who travelled in or near areas affected by the virus would be labeled a SARS patient despite many of these individuals being diagnosed with other respiratory illnesses.”David Martin has released his “The Fauci/Covid-19 Dossier,” a 205 page document citing specific charges against the CDC, Dr. Anthony Fauci and his National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Disease, and individuals engaged in coronavirus “gain of function” research for funding and allegedly conspiring to commit acts of terror, lying to Congress, conspiring to engage in criminal commercial activity, illegal clinical trials and market manipulation and allocation. 

- Speaking at the February 2016 Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness for Catastrophic Events, Daszak stated,“… until an infectious disease crisis is very real, present, and at an emergency threshold, it is often largely ignored. 

- To sustain the funding base beyond the crisis, we need to increase public understanding of the need for MCMs [Medical Counter Measures] such as a pan-influenza or pan-coronavirus vaccine. 

- These include 1) acting against the American Medical Association’s April 2020 recommendation that “face masks should not be worn by healthy individuals from acquiring respiratory infections because there is no evidence to suggest that face masks worn by healthy individuals are effective in preventing people from becoming ill.” 2) acting against existing published studies that show “to date, not a single study has confirmed that social distancing of any population prevented the transmission of, or the infection by SARS CoV-2.” And 3) in violation of FTC Act 15 U.S.C. 

- 41, no product or service can be advertised to “prevent, treat or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable evidence… substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made.”  This third point applies to NIAID’s promotion of face masks as well as Fauci’s aggressive push to make the drug Remdesivir, which Fauci is personally financially invested in, as a first line for treatment.If these charges of illegal activity against sound scientific evidence, are true, they warrant a thorough investigation in an international criminal court to determine their motivations.

- In Israel, conditions of facial paralysis associated with Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine are worrying health authorities. 

- Seemingly the man was already asymptomatic with the virus; this raises the question of whether the vaccine is more dangerous in people already infected – a medical concern that none of the SARS-Cov2 trials investigated nor were they ever designed to. 

- “What they [Israeli citizens] are being asked to inject is not a vaccine defined by the CDC as a product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease,” writes Jerusalem Health Wellness counselor Ilana Rachel Daniel in her oped, “rather it is an experimental and novel technology…. 

- It is in fact a medical device, a physical device that comes in a molecular sized package.”  Pfizer, Moderna and Anthony Fauci have already made it abundantly clear that these vaccines are not intended to stop transmission but only to prevent serious illness. 

- In the US, as of January 19th, 6,741 Americans having had serious enough vaccine adverse effects, with a total number of 29,081 events, that required special medical assistance or hospitalization after receiving the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. 

- The question has been readdressed even by the prestigious British Medical Journal. 

- The British Medical Journal’s article warrants first page headlines on newspapers across the country. 

- What is remarkable is that Anthony Fauci, the federal health agencies and the media know this is true. 

- It has also been shown that the dominant medical establishment efforts to prevent HCQ’s use included the publication of studies in major medical journals such as The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine attempting to conclude the drug was dangerous and posed serious risks.

- In addition to the psychological impacts of breast cancer, approximately 20 to 50 percent of survivors report experiencing chronic neuropathic pain following treatment. 

- Due to these negative effects and the complexity of treatment for this type of pain following breast cancer treatment, it is important to provide adjunct treatment and management options. 

- We used state-of-the-art brain imaging at The Ottawa Hospital, on their 3T MRI scanner and collected data on white matter health, brain activity during emotional pain related word processing and during resting state. 

- Women with neuropathic pain were imaged before and after an MBSR program, or treatment as usual. 

- Our results show a significant improvement in brain health as well as in pain perception. 

- "This research provides hope for a non-invasive method of easing the struggle of chronic neuropathic pain in women following breast cancer treatment. 

- Pain is something that people fear, and many people run into significant secondary problems because of their pain medication use, including drug misuse and mental health issues. 

- This research shows that there are adjunctive treatment options. 

- If used properly, the information we have published can improve health outcomes for the people involved and could potentially also reduce health costs, as well as some of the related problems - particularly those related to mental health." 

- The data was collected over two years, from 2017 to 2019, funded by both Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation grants. 

- The results were then included in a meta-analysis of 26 studies with a total of 1,828,149 subjects that evaluated the association between calcium intake and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and incident cardiovascular disease, aortic stenosis, heart failure, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and stroke. 

- When divided into fifths according to amount of their calcium intake, EPIC-Norfolk participants whose intake of calcium was between 771 mg and 926 mg per day had a 9% lower risk of dying from any cause and participants whose intake was 1074 mg to 1254 mg had a 15% lower risk in comparison with subjects whose intake was among the lowest fifth at less than 770 mg. Cardiovascular disease mortality was also reduced in these groups. 

- Health benefits of replacing wheat flour with chickpea flour Kings College London and Quadram Institute, January 11, 2021 Researchers from the Quadram Institute and King's College London have shown that replacing wheat flour with a new ingredient derived from chickpeas improved the glycaemic response of people eating white bread. 

- With this condition on the rise, along with obesity and other metabolic disorders, providing foods and ingredients that help consumers better manage blood glucose could help combat these challenges to health.

- The Gary Null Show is here to inform you on the best news in health, healing, the environment and all things political around the world.Will the Covid Vaccine Meet Its Quixotic Promises?Gary Null and Richard GaleProgressive Radio Network, January 7, 2021Daily we hear and observe a stream of endless propaganda about the miracles of the new generation of Covid vaccines in order to calm fears and increase public compliance. 

- Top health officials, popular politicians and celebrities are jumping before the cameras to be the first to receive injections. 

- Anthony Fauci and the captains in the pandemic efforts claim Moderna’s and Pfizer’s vaccines are about 95 percent effective, and the Department of Health and Human Services is convincing us they are safe and effective. 

- There is nothing to be concerned about, we are told, except those anti-vaccine heretics, who the World Health Organization has now dubbed among the ten most dangerous risks to global health. 

- The Gary Null Show is here to inform you on the best news in health, healing, the environment and all things political around the world. 

- Hello Fellow Freedom Fighters, It appears the NYS assembly will vote on Bill A-416 this Wed, 1/6, which would allow the Governor and health authorities to detain and forcibly vaccinate New Yorkers without normal due process. 

- Top health officials, popular politicians and celebrities are jumping before the cameras to be the first to receive injections. 

- Anthony Fauci and the captains in the pandemic efforts claim Moderna’s and Pfizer’s vaccines are about 95 percent effective, and the Department of Health and Human Services is convincing us they are safe and effective. 

- There is nothing to be concerned about, we are told, except those anti-vaccine heretics, who the World Health Organization has now dubbed among the ten most dangerous risks to global health.What the media blitzkrieg is ignoring are the very legitimate and even worrisome unanswered questions on the minds of many citizens. 

- Due to the widespread abuse of PCR, which was never designed nor intended to be relied upon as a confirmatory diagnostic tool, a growing number of medical experts argue that the US, the UK, Germany and other EU nations are facing a “casedemic” rather than a pandemic due to a pathogenic virus. 

- Despite PCR’s high rate of misdiagnoses, positive results are still being reported as Covid cases.In early December, the New England Journal of Medicine published a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease analysis of the Moderna vaccine’s length of efficacy based upon neutralizing antibody levels. 

- The most recent issue of the British Medical Journal reports that natural immunity following infection lasts approximately 6 months. 

- The World Health Organization has stated that there is no “evidence on any of the vaccines to be confident that it’s going to prevent people from actually getting the infection and therefore being able to pass it on.”Back in October, Dr. Peter Doshi, at the time an editor for the British Medical Journal, had already warned that the later vaccine clinical trials were never properly designed to determine whether it would reduce the likelihood of falling ill nor prevent infection. 

- Thus, vaccination is unlikely to be effective in preventing disease following an exposure.”Reports are already coming in to confirm this. 

- In his presentation to the Working Group, Dr. Thomas Clark presented statistics showing that there was a minimum of 3,150 “health impact events” among 112,807 vaccine recipients (2.7 percent) during only a five-day period (December 14-18). 

- Moreover, these 3,150 adverse events were tagged as “unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, required care from a doctor or health care professional.”  The presentation did not include the number of minor and moderate adverse events which are likely much higher.In early October we reported on Covid-19 vaccine risks stated by Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, the former chair of microbiology at the University of Mainz Medical School in Germany. 

- The precautionary principle quite simply states that any new medical intervention with results that are either disputed or unknown should be avoided. 

- Now we are injecting questionable genetically engineered substances into human bodies, and worse there are voices that want to mandate this enormously expensive experiment long before any reliable medical consensus can be reached on their long-term safety.If the precautionary principle had been respected and honored during the past 100 years, the US would have prevented untold numbers of life-long injuries and deaths due to the public advertising of smoking, asbestos and DDT poisoning, synthetic hormone replacement, toxic pesticides such as Monsanto’s glyphosate, AZT during the early part of AIDS epidemic, and the swine flu and Gardasil vaccines that were also rushed to market without proper scientific oversight. 

- This is part of the corporate cancel culture to erase our protections.These trends that have become ingrained into the government’s politick have led to today’s largest propaganda campaign in the country’s history and is now orchestrated by the CDC and NIH in collusion with the pharmaceutical industrial complex, Bill Gates, many of our leading corporate-funded medical schools and institutions and across the ideological spectrum of the media. 

- This is the same artifice of corporate scoundrels and their media escorts that have relied on faulty science, fabricate their own research to serve their financial interests, and hide behind a cloak of non-transparency who Fauci now encourages us to openheartedly trust as Covid vaccines reach your local clinics and downtown pharmacies.There may be no reason to doubt Fauci’s and our health agency’s sincerity and determination to protect the health of Americans during this crisis. 

- Sadly their past track records of colluding and showing favoritism to private interests over public health should top the list of our worries.

- A More Honest Perspective of the Covid-19 PandemicRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, December 23, 2020Since the first cases of the new coronavirus strain outside of China, every aspect of the pandemic’s ever-changing amoebic narrative has been carefully controlled by the World Health Organization and major government health agencies. 

- High officials within a syndicate of institutions, including the CDC, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and the UK’s National Heath Service, have largely dictated government responses to lessen the pandemic. 

- The Sars2-Cov19 pandemic is not the first time unelected medical bureaucrats, who the average person assumes to possess an enduring expertise, have guided global policies against pandemics and serous infectious outbreaks. 

- Subsequently that effort revealed a surprising incompetence in the international medical hierarchy that can be blamed on the entire system rather than a few inept individuals.However, during the current pandemic scare, something unusual and remarkably radical has happened. 

- Most often it is only a handful of health professionals who come forward to challenge official statements or to uncover the serious flaws in the scientific literature to support their actions. 

- Yet for the past year we have witnessed tens of thousands of physicians, medical experts and researchers coming forward publicly with harsh and even damning criticisms of how the ruling medical agencies have mishandled the pandemic. 

- They easily recognize these agencies’ contradictions, the conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry, the large body of medical literature deconstructing and discrediting their fundamental claims, and the evidence to prove their policies are scientifically baseless. 

- Over 52,000 medical professionals representing some of the world’s leading medical schools and research institutions have already signed the Great Barrington Declaration in protest against the official Covid-19 strategies and these policies’ serious adverse effects on the physical and mental health of children, working class citizens and the poor. 

- And they are fully aware of the pushback and blacklisting that may follow and would injure their reputations.Read Rest of Article

- Efficacy and Safety of Tetrahydrocurcuminoids for the Treatment of Canker Sore and Gingivitis. 

- Iatraogenic medicine, or medical error, is now the third leading cause of death in the US after cardiovascular disease and cancer. 

- Consequently our health agencies’ oversight and monitoring of drugs on the market is dismal.One of the worst corporate deals the US government may have ever made in modern history was to acquire the American subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical firm Merck and Company during the first world war. 

- The scam was orchestrated through personal bank accounts with the sole purpose of advancing drug approvals through foreign nations’ regulatory medical agencies.One of the largest frauds in recent medical history was the company’s anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx that resulted in fines above $4.8 billion for causing over a minimum 60,000 deaths from sudden heart attacks and over 120,000 serious medical injuries. 

- The Australian government launched a class action suit against the drug maker on charges that employees schemed a fake scientific paper that was ghostwritten for a medical journal in order to put Vioxx into a positive light. 

- According to the documents, these physicians were targeted to be “neutralized” or “discredited.” Some, including Dr. James Fries at Sanford University’s medical school, were clinical investigators who happened to speak out about the drug’s shortcomings. 

- Merck’s revolving door is not limited to our federal health agencies, but also fully infiltrates some of the world’s most shadowy international PR firms that specialize in whitewashing the public images of executive elites, corporations and in the case of the PR firm Burson-Marsteller even dictators. 

- MSNBC reported back in 2009, “When evil needs public relations, evil has Burson-Marsteller on speed dial.”But Merck’s efforts to conceal the dangers of its products, falsify data about drugs’ efficacy and safety and exaggeration of medical claims go back sixty years. 

- In 2007, its cholesterol drug Zetia was shown to increase liver disease. 

- Known as a “carrier solution,” the standard scientific protocol does not designate it as a proper placebo for measuring the efficacy and disease risks of a drug. 

- None of Merck’s vaccines have ever undergone a “rigorous review” prior to regulatory approval.Although not completely innocent from internal unfairness and conflicts of interest, the Cochrane Database Collaboration arguably remains the most reliable resource for analysis of drugs, vaccines and medical devices in the evidence-based medical establishment. 

- In its 2016 analysis of Merck’s human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil, the investigators were so alarmed they filed a complaint against the European Medical Agency for failing to adequately assess the vaccine’s neurological harms.As we have recently witnessed with Monsanto’s Roundup and Bayer’s settlement of $10 billion to cover 80,000 lawsuits, Gardasil may very well become the company’s Achilles heel. 

- The development, scientific rationale, fraudulent clinical trials and data reporting, and inside negotiations with federal health officials to market the vaccine to pre-teen and teen girls and boys, is a story riddled with misconduct. 

- Gardasil’s success has nothing to do with the prevention of an urgent national health need. 

- In his letter to the French government in defiance of Merck’s lobbying efforts, Delephine stated:“A compulsory health measure should not be based on faith in vaccination or hidden conflicts of interest, but on proven facts, verifiable by every citizen. 

- However, the facts established by the official records of cancer registries show that HPV vaccination does not protect against invasive cancer of the cervix, but seems rather to maintain its frequency at a high level and sometimes even increase it.”An article published in the French journal Agoravox noted that other national health ministries are coming around to acknowledge that Gardasil is an extremely unsafe vaccine. 

- Medical researchers at the University of South Alabama presented their paper at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology’s annual conference. 

- Kennedy’s in-depth investigations through his Children’s Health Defense organization has uncovered evidence that the vaccine increases birth defects in children conceived of HPV-vaccinated moms; miscarriages have increased 2000 percent above normal, and girls are experiencing serious reproductive complications, including infertility, at approximately ten-fold above the normal rate. 

- There is a 10-fold increase for ovarian failure, and 1 in 37 girls who receive the vaccine will experience an autoimmune disease after 6 months of receiving the series of injections. 

- Sadly, across the nation, politicians from both sides of the aisle in state legislatures, notably Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York, are doing Merck’s bidding to mandate Gardasil for all girls and boys upon entering school.Based upon Kennedy’s research and documents received from Freedom of Information Act filings, during Merck’s own Gardasil clinical trials, 2.3 percent of girls and women between the ages of 9 through 26 developed a serious autoimmune disease and crippling neurological disorders within seven months of vaccination. 

- The most frequent adverse effects were arthritis and anthropathy, autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, Raynaud’s Phenomenon, rheumatoid arthritis and uveitis. 

- He stated during the Progressive Radio Network broadcast that according to Merck’s own statistics, girls are one hundred times more likely to experience a serious adverse effect from the vaccine than to be protected from cervical cancer.In a 2012 article published in the Journal of Law and Medical Ethics, researchers at the University of British Columbia wrote that ever since Gardasil was approved in 2006, Merck has engaged in an “overly aggressive marketing strategies and lobbying campaigns aimed at promoting Gardasil as a mandatory vaccine.”  One strategy Merck has employed is to take advantage of FDA loopholes to fast track its drugs. 

- In the case of its expanded Gardasil-9 for adults between the ages of 27 to 45, the company applied for fast tracking two days after the Journal of Toxicological and Environmental Health published a study that the HPV vaccine was lowering the probability of pregnancy for women in their 20s.Unfortunately, the media has indiscriminately colluded with Merck’s scam. 

- Its prime directive is selling drugs; its history of misdemeanors and criminal activities should indicate the company holds little integrity in its commitment to prevent and treat disease. 

- Therefore we recommend people to support the efforts of Bobby Kennedy and the Children’s Health Defense in its lawsuit against Merck’s Gardasil.

- If the exemption is denied, there is also a process for overturning the decision.ByPam LongChildren’s Health Defense, November 30, 2020The Department of Defense (DOD) Instruction 1300.17, “Religious Liberties in the Military Services,” conveys support for religious beliefs in the following statement:“In accordance with Section 533(a)(1) of Public Law 112-239, as amended, the DOD components will accommodate individual expressions of sincerely held beliefs (conscience, moral principles or religious beliefs) which do not have an adverse impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, good order and discipline, or health and safety. 

- The service member’s memorandum should also explain how the requested religious accommodation will not interfere with military readiness, unit cohesion, good order and discipline, health and safety. 

- Memorandums from other chaplains or religious leaders may accompany the request as optional attachments, but do not meet the requirement for interview by the assigned unit chaplain or one determined by the senior chaplain present.”The third required document is a counseling form documenting a discussion with a healthcare provider and the service member on the risks of disease, and benefits and risks of vaccines.

- America’s Sacrificial Altar for Google, Wikipedia and the Pharmaceutical EmpireRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, December 3, 2020Weekly, millions of people do Google searches for advice about their personal health, a large variety of illnesses, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, dementia, etc., drug and vaccine safety, and scores of other topics affecting physical and mental health. 

- For the large majority of people, a personal medical condition or health crisis begins by turning exclusively to established medical, drug-based protocols. 

- However, these treatments do not always relieve symptoms and very rarely reverse disease. 

- At a minimum it is assumed that content is scientifically validated and on matters of health and disease from the National Institutes of Health PubMed database. 

- Whether it regards a pharmaceutical, surgical or radiological approach, or perhaps a more natural medical modality such as lifestyle change, nutrition, medical botanicals, Chiropractic and Chinese Medicine, information is expected to be accurately described. 

- Then using our freedom of choice and informed consent, we can select the medical route that we believe would be most safe and effective.Unfortunately, our four-year investigation into Wikipedia's treatment of health issues reveals exactly the opposite. 

- You enter a highly politicized ideological war and the encyclopedia’s parent organization, the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), will do essentially nothing to correct errors or reprimand belligerent senior administrators and editors.Much of Wikipedia’s chaos over unreliable health information is due to a relatively small group of non-credentialed, hate-filled individuals, popularly known as Skeptics. 

- With Wikipedia’s co-founder Jimmy Wales’ full support, Skeptics have hijacked the site and converted it into their personal social media platform to condemn all non-conventional and alternative medical therapies and its practitionersand voices who are critical of the dominant drug and vaccine based medical paradigm.Since its founding certain editors realized that Wikipedia was prime game for writing entries and reshaping content as a means to proselytize their personal ideological agendas. 

- In 2006 Wikipedia editor Paul Lee, a physical therapist in California’s Central Valley and an avowed Skeptic, started to reach out to internet Skeptic groups to recruit editors to advance the Skeptic mission to ridicule and discredit all forms of complementary and alternative medicine, marginalize those who question vaccination safety and efficacy, and attack critics of corporate commercial interests adversely impacting the nation’s health such as genetically modified crops, fluoridation, sugar and junk food, etc.That year Lee posted on the International Skeptic Forum:“I would like to invite webmasters and site owners to begin editing Wikipedia and SkepticWiki. 

- Over time, Quackwatch and its Skeptic allies such as the Center for Inquiry and the Science Based Medicine blog have exponentially increased their presence on Wikipedia to become the single most cited references in the Skeptics’ arsenal to attack alternative medical therapies and the critics of conventional medicine’s power base. 

- It is simply too profitable to disrupt.But the Skeptics’ distorted and biased narratives about medicine and health are only one reason to be deeply worried about the WMF’s long-term mission to bring all medical knowledge to the inhabitable world. 

- By and large, Wikipedia Skeptics are not motivated by financial gain nor is there strong evidence of conflicts of interest with either the pharmaceutical industry or our federal health agencies. 

- There is plenty of evidence confirming Google’s preferential treatment of Wikipedia aside from the millions of daily Google searches that bring users directly to the encyclopedia.Although Wikipedia editors take full advantage of flawed medical literature if the conclusions serve their purpose and agenda, Google, through its algorithmic modeling to censor voices challenging the medical regime’s status-quo, ignores efforts to determine whether the medical literature is bogus or not. 

- Google’s mission is to protect the global medical regime -- not just private drug companies but also government health bodies and international organizations such as the World Health Organization.No longer should Google be perceived solely as a technological platform to promote the pharmaceutical industry’s agenda. 

- Therefore the company has positioned itself to perhaps be the greatest potential threat to human health via the flow of information and data viewed on our laptops and mobile phones.During the past five years, the pharmaceutical industry has shown a growing interest in the concept of virtual pharmacies, whereby drug companies can leverage their influence over consumers. 

- Social media, notably Wikipedia, has become the consumer’s most utilized resource for gaining knowledge about disease, drugs and health. 

- In a University of Sydney survey, Wikipedia was the first source of choice for gaining information about unfamiliar health topics, even among medical professionals. 

- According to a 2013 joint analysis of this emerging trend, conducted by the University of Zurich and Johnson and Johnson, drug companies can use these virtual platforms to tackle the challenges they face in the financial market and even within medical communities. 

- In 2014, in a reaction against legal issues over privacy matters, Google created an “Advisory Council.” Wales was one of its founding members.In 2012, Google’s charitable arm, Google.org, initiated a collaboration with WMF’s WikiProject Medicine “to further improve the quality of articles” by recruiting and hiring “professional medical editors.”  Dr. James Heilman, a Canadian emergency room physician and a seasoned senior Wikipedia administrator who frequently comes to the defense of Skeptic Wikipedians, sits on the WMF’s Board of Trustees. 

- Heilman is one of the founders of the Wiki Project Med Foundation (WPMF) to advance its mission to give “every single person free access to the sum of all medical knowledge.” WPMF now has collaborative relationships with the National Institutes of Health, Cancer Research UK, Cochrane Collaboration, the University of California at San Francisco, the Wellcome Trust and several open-access medical journals.Recently during the Covid-19 pandemic, WMF has strengthened its ties with the global medical establishment. 

- Last October it entered a collaboration with the World Health Organization to assure that public health information and data about Covid-19 is regulated in accordance with the latest pronouncements made by the anointed authorities in the institutional medical establishment. 

- Few in the scientific and federal health agencies can be trusted anymore. 

- Rarely is a mainstream journalist trustworthy, and no one can be certain whether a paper appearing in a peer-reviewed science journal or an medical entry on Wikipedia is reliable or not. 

- The Surgeon General, the heads of federal health agencies, drug makers, the insurance industry, medical schools and professional associations, Google and WMF, and the media operate as a single voice that the American health system is the best in the world when it is surely not. 

- And numerous patients are being played for fools.The fact is that all players in the architecture of our medical system are vulnerable to corruption. 

- Today, the medical regime is a single entity. 

- Therefore they both are equally culpable in the widespread destruction of the nation’s public health.Yet we mustn’t expect that the trajectory of an emerging global pharmaceutical hegemony will experience a collapse anytime soon. 

- Rather, with the aid of Google and WMF, it will increasingly monopolize the medical discourse and define the national policies shaping public health. 

- And this requires greater efforts to censor and silence the medical critics and honest investigative journalists bringing light to the medical and scientific flaws upon which health policies and laws are based through the virtual technological apparatus and information control Google and WMF provides. 

- The dangerous fallout is that objectivity and ethics are being increasingly sacrificed on a cold virtual altar devoted to a perverted metaphysical realism disguised as medical science and fact.

- Green Mediterranean ('green Med') diet may be even better for health. 

- Yet at the same time there is a growing number of voices within the medical and scientific communities criticizing these policies and providing evidence that the current lockdowns and flawed preventative measures are not working. 

- Many of the tens of thousands of medical critics come from the world’s most respected institutions such as Harvard, Oxford, Stanford and Yale medical schools. 

- Over 47,000 epidemiologists and public health experts and 639,000 concerned citizens have now signed the Great Barrington Declaration to publicize the warning that the policies now being enacted are having a far more detrimental effect on public health and the economy than the virus itself.None of these experts are suggesting that Covid-19 is not real nor are they questioning its virulence. 

- Since the outbreak and reports of the first wave of deaths, federal health officials have conflated actual Covid-19 deaths with fatalities due to other preexisting comorbidities. 

- We would agree with Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, a former Chairperson at the University of Mainz medical school in Germany that we are in fact caught in a pandemic of over-testing rather than in a pandemic caused by a pathogen. 

- Numerous medical professionals are now on record criticizing the use of PCR tests for clinical diagnosis. 

- Even the world’s vaccine czar Bill Gates told Wire magazine in an interview that “the majority of all US tests are complete garbage, waste.” But their voices are unrecognized by federal and state health officials nor are state governors paying attention. 

- Furthermore, over 90 percent of Covid deaths were in nursing homes, intensive care units with patients admitted for other illnesses, hospices, assisted living centers and security prisons with their horrendous medical care systems.Dr. 

- There can be no other explanation for the blatant negligence of scientific facts unfavorable towards PCR’s reliability to diagnose any infectious virus.If the medical establishment had conducted proper evaluation of the actual death rate, we may never have reached a pandemic level. 

- An altogether different approach for protecting public health may have been mandated with public warnings, masks, frequent hand washing and common sense hygienic measures that are encouraged during any severe flu season and without lockdowns or shutting down the economy.Now that thousands of physicians in clinical practice are having extraordinary success in treat early stage Covid-19 infections with low dose hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the antibiotic azithromycin and zinc, we must ask a simple question. 

- On November 20th, the WHO released a “conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients, regardless of disease severity, as there is currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients.”HCQ on the other hand can be safely used preventatively for front-line workers. 

- And yet the medical bureaucracies at the federal and state levels have viciously attacked HCQ’s proponents and the drug itself with false claims that it is ineffective and even dangerous. 

- A review of 179 HCQ studies, 114 peer-reviewed, showed that almost 100 percent sowed positive effects for early treatment. 

- Yet our conventional health system has never been a strong advocate for nutrition and healthy lifestyle as a preventative policy to fight disease or infections. 

- Rather for the past century we have had a disease management system: we wait until a person becomes sick and then treat it with pharmaceutical drugs. 

- Anthony Fauci now offers a carrot of hope that if enough people are vaccinated we can reach that elusive and hypothetical “herd immunity,” which has never been scientifically and consensually confirmed for any vaccine against any infectious disease in the past. 

- But at what cost to the public’s future health is completely unknown territory.More recently, during an exclusive interview with Dr. John Martin, the former head of the FDA’s Viral Oncology Laboratory where he investigated vaccine contamination from cancer-causing viruses, he raised warnings about the potential interaction between the vaccines using either mRNA or the genetically modified adenovirus with stealth adapted viruses already present in the body. 

- These stealth viruses largely present no health risks and do not trigger an immune response; however, they are highly reactive and can incorporate the vaccine’s mRNA, and then be converted into cellular DNA, or they can mutate into something more virulent and pathogenic. 

- Although health officials are fully aware of stealth viruses, and have known about them since the early days of the polio vaccine, it is a risk completely being ignored and off the table when evaluating the new generation of Covid vaccines.Behind all of the public fear, contradictory science, flawed statistics, and bureaucratic knee-jerk reactions, we are now witnessing the complete politicalization of a medical threat that should have been handled with consensual independent scientific data rather than through social control. 

- Gates himself has been a sharp critic for how our government and federal health agencies have handled the crisis. 

- Dr. John Martin is the Medical Director of the nonprofit public charity MI Hope in California. 

- He holds a medical degree from the University of Sydney and a doctorate from the University of Melbourne and has specialized in immunopathology and medical microbiology. 

- Earlier in his career Dr. Martin worked for the National Institutes of Health and later at the FDA where he headed the Viral Oncology Laboratory.

- Vitamin D and Omega-3s bolster health in some active older people. 

- Vitamin C's effectiveness against COVID may hinge on vitamin's natural transporter levelsMedical College of Georgia Center for Healthy Aging, November 12, 2020High doses of vitamin C under study for treating COVID-19 may benefit some populations, but investigators exploring its potential in aging say key factors in effectiveness include levels of the natural transporter needed to get the vitamin inside cells.Age, race, gender, as well as expression levels and genetic variations of those vitamin C transporters that make them less efficient, all may be factors in the effectiveness of vitamin C therapy against COVID-19 and other maladies, investigators at the Medical College of Georgia Center for Healthy Aging report in a commentary in the journal Aging and Disease.The investigators recommend that those factors be considered in the design and execution of clinical trials, and when trial results are analyzed, for COVID-19 as well as other conditions, says Dr. Sadanand Fulzele, aging researcher and the article's corresponding author.The novel nature and lack of immunity against the coronavirus has prompted a worldwide pursuit of effective treatments for COVID-19, they write. 

- Clinical trials in osteoarthritis, for example, an autoimmune disease where a misdirected immune system is attacking the joints, has gotten mixed results, Fulzele says. 

- However its usage in other viral-induced problems, like potentially deadly sepsis, has shown benefit in reducing organ failure and improving lung function in acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is also a major cause of sickness and death with COVID-19.At the time their Aging and Disease paper was published, there were not yet published studies of the efficacies of high-dose, intravenous vitamin studies underway for COVID-19.Fulzele, who works on vitamin C in aging, and others have shown that some conditions, like osteoarthritis and even normal aging, are associated with significant downregulation of at least one subtype of vitamin C transporter.In fact, part of the paradox and concern with COVID-19 is that those most at risk mostly have both lower levels of vitamin C before they get sick and fewer transporters to enable the vitamin to be of benefit if they get more, Fulzele says.Many of those most at risk from COVID-19, including individuals who are older, Black, male and with chronic medical conditions like osteoarthritis, hypertension and diabetes, tend to have lower levels of vitamin C, another reason vitamin C therapy would be considered a reasonable treatment, Isales says. 

- While increasing transporter expression is not yet doable in humans, one of Fulzele's many research goals is to find a drug or other method to directly increase expression, which should improve the health of older individuals as well as those with other medical conditions that compromise those levels.He notes that reduced transporter levels that occur naturally with age are a factor in the reduced immune function that also typically accompanies aging. 

- Reduced immune function in older individuals is known to put them at increased risk for problems like cancer and COVID-19.Low vitamin C levels also have been correlated with higher mortality in older individuals from causes like cardiovascular disease. 

- High oxidative stress, a major factor in conditions like cardiovascular disease as well as aging and now COVID-19, also is associated with significantly reduced expression of the vitamin C transporter.Isales and Fulzele doubt that taking a lot of vitamin C is a good preventive strategy against COVID-19, except in those individuals with a known deficiency.Vitamin C is an essential vitamin, which means people have to consume it in their food or supplements. 

- The vitamin's diverse roles in the body also include formation of blood vessels, collagen and cartilage.Emerging role of vitamin C in prevention and treatment of novel respiratory virusUniversity of Otago (New Zealand), November 11, 2020According to news reporting out of Christchurch, New Zealand, research stated, “Investigation into the role of vitamin C in the prevention and treatment of pneumonia and sepsis has been underway for many decades. 

- This research has laid a strong foundation for translation of these findings into patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19).”Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of Otago: “Research has indicated that patients with pneumonia and sepsis have low vitamin C status and elevated oxidative stress. 

- Administration of vitamin C to patients with pneumonia can decrease the severity and duration of the disease. 

- Due to the excellent safety profile, low cost, and potential for rapid upscaling of production, administration of vitamin C to patients with hypovitaminosis C and severe respiratory infections, e.g., COVID-19, appears warranted.”Beneficial effects of intermittent fasting: an update on mechanism, and the role of circadian rhythm and gut microbiotaSun Yat-sen University (China), November 11, 2020According to news originating from Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Importance: There is accumulating evidence that intermittent fasting (IF) is connected to improved health condition and longevity time-restricted feeding (TRF) is the most recognized and extensively studied model of IF. 

- Moreover, the advantages of IF, especially TRF over total caloric restriction (CR) provided bases for various animal and human studies which suggested that the feeding-fasting rhythm stimulates the fluctuation of our gut microbiota and a series of subsequent molecular alterations, which in turn restored a healthier circadian clock that resembled our inherent clock formed throughout millions of years of homo sapiens history.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Conclusions and Relevance for Reviews: Complete understanding of the mechanism leading to the beneficial effects of IF paves the way for tailored dietary regimen to combat a wide range of diseases and ill health conditions.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Valerian Quality, Storage Issues May Affect Sleep OutcomesChiba and Nagasaki universities (Japan), November 1, 2020Valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.) may be a safe and effective herbal sleep aid; however quality control issues may affect outcomes, according to the findings of a recently published systematic review and meta-analysis.While valerian is considered a popular herbal supplement for managing sleep disorders, study outcomes related to its effectiveness have been inconsistent. 

- Efforts to reduce opioid use and increase physically based therapies to reduce pain and increase physical function and safety are crucial.Patients are often advised to use non-pharmacological treatments to manage lower back pain such as exercise and mind-body interventions. 

- They examined yoga, tai chi, which combines gentle physical exercise and stretching with mindfulness, and qigong, a traditional Chinese meditative movement therapy focused on body awareness and attention during slow, relaxed, and fluid repetitive body movements. 

- Findings from their review provide empirical evidence regarding the benefits of yoga, tai chi, and qigong, which have been recommended by health care providers for patients with lower back pain. 

- "Back pain is a major public health issue often contributing to emotional distress such as depression and anxiety, as well as sleep issues and even social isolation," said Juyoung Park, Ph.D., corresponding author and an associate professor in the Phyllis and Harvey Sandler School of Social Work within FAU's College for Design and Social Inquiry. 

- Results found that the majority of these articles showed movement-based mind-body interventions to be effective for treatment of low back pain, reporting positive outcomes such as reduction in pain or psychological distress such as depression and anxiety, reduction in pain-related disability, and improved functional ability. 

- within FAU's Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, and a faculty fellow of FAU's Institute for Human Health and Disease Intervention (I-HEALTH). 

- Moreover, the economic burden of chronic low back pain is high due to the cost of medications such as opioids, procedures, hospitalization, surgical treatment, and absence from work. 

- "Yoga, tai chi and qigong could be used as effective treatment alternatives to pain medications, surgery, or injection-based treatments such as nerve blocks, which are associated with high incidence of adverse effects in treating lower back pain," said Park. 

- "Go (over) easy on the eggs: 'Egg-cess' consumption linked to diabetesUniversity of South Australia, China Medical University, Qatar University, November 15, 2020Scrambled, poached or boiled, eggs are a popular breakfast food the world over. 

- Yet the health benefits of the humble egg might not be all they're cracked up to be as new research from the University of South Australia shows that excess egg consumption can increase your risk of diabetes.Conducted in partnership with the China Medical University, and Qatar University, the longitudinal study (1991 to 2009) is the first to assess egg consumption in a large sample of Chinese adults.It found that people who regularly consumed one or more eggs per day (equivalent to 50 grams) increased their risk of diabetes by 60 per cent.With the prevalence of diabetes in China now exceeding 11 per cent - above that of the global average of 8.5 per cent - diabetes has become a serious public health concern.The economic impact of diabetes is also significant, accounting for 10 per cent of global health expenditure (USD $760 billion). 

- In China, diabetes-related costs have exceeded USD $109 billion.Epidemiologist and public health expert, UniSA's Dr Ming Li, says the rise of diabetes is a growing concern, especially in China where changes to the traditional Chinese diet are impacting health. 

- "Diet is a known and modifiable factor that contributes to the onset Type 2 diabetes, so understanding the range of dietary factors that might impact the growing prevalence of the disease is important," Dr Li says. 

- "This study makes it possible to compare a vegan diet with a mixed diet with regard to a variety vitamins and trace elements," says BfR President Professor Dr. Dr. Andreas Hensel. 

- The deficiency was significantly more pronounced among vegans - in one third of them, the level was below 20 micrograms per litre (μg/L), the limit defined by the World Health Organization (WHO); anything below this represents a serious shortage. 

- A vegan diet has, however, also shown health benefits, such as a higher fibre intake and lower cholesterol levels. 

- For both diets, about 10% of participants had an iron deficiency.One-third of people with cancer use complementary and alternative medicinesUniversity of Texas, October 31, 2020A stunning one-third of people with a cancer diagnosis use complementary and alternative medicines such as meditation, yoga, acupuncture, herbal medicine, and supplements.UT Southwestern Medical Center's Dr. Nina Sanford made the discovery that's now drawing renewed attention to habits she said cancer patients must disclose during treatment. 

- Dr. Sanford is an Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology who specializes in and treats cancers of the gastrointestinal tract.Herbal supplements were the most common alternative medicine and chiropractic, or osteopathic manipulation, was the second most common, according to Dr. Sanford's analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health Interview Survey. 

- Unless we know what's in them, I would recommend patients avoid using them during radiation because there's likely not data on certain supplements, which could interfere with treatment. 

- Only after treatment did she start taking turmeric, omega-3, vitamin D, and vitamin B6. 

- "She said she knows of some people with cancer who use only alternative medicine - and no traditional medical treatments. 

- He turned to traditional medicine late in his battle with cancer and died in 2011.While doctors are highly cautious about the use of herbs and other supplements during treatment, they are much more open to meditation and yoga as practices that can help patients cope with the shock of a cancer diagnosis and the stress of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. 

- "We strongly advise patients to stay active and engage in exercise during treatment," Dr. Sanford said. 

- I let the patients know that the patients who feel the most fatigue are the ones who are the most sedentary and that those who are doing exercise are the ones who frequently have the most energy.

A study has demonstrated that omega-3 rich foods improve post-heart attack prognosisRegularly consuming omega-3, from both animal and vegetable origins, strengthens the heart's membranes thereby helping to reduce the risk of hospital readmission and mortality after a heart attackHospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (Spain), October 27 ,2020A team of researchers from the Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital and Research Institute (IGTP) and the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM) has shown that regularly consuming foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, from both animal and vegetable origins, strengthens the heart's membranes and helps improve the prognosis in the event of a myocardial infarction.To arrive at these conclusions, they used data from 950 patients. 

- While high levels of EPA are associated with a lower risk of hospital readmission from cardiovascular causes, higher levels of ALA are associated with a reduced risk of death.Antoni Bayés, clinical director of Cardiology at Germans Trias, concludes: "Incorporating marine and vegetable omega-3s into the diet of patients at risk of cardiovascular disease is an integrative strategy for improving both their quality of life and prognosis if they suffer a heart attack.

- Stanford University’s Dr. Johann Ioannidis recent study in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization reviewed the available scientific studies and concluded that there was no huge spike in deaths that can be attributed exclusively to Covid-19. 

- Consequently, the pandemic is only based upon numerical calculations that have little relevancy to real biological cause.There is a rising concern among federal health officials about the soaring rates in drug overdoses and suicides, which can be largely credited to the pandemic response and its socio-economic fallout:  loss of jobs, foreclosures, family strife, depression, loss of health insurance and welfare benefits, and being confined indoors.

- Therefore, unlike previous years, more patients now are dying from the lack of medical attention. 

- Clearly, we are miscalculating the causes of the death horribly.Aside from pre-existing diseases that make these individuals more vulnerable to symptomatic infection, we must also acknowledge that efforts to halt the virus’ spread and the Trump administration’s dreadful economic response, has tossed millions of Americans into even worse health conditions.

- In contrast to most other studies investigating links between nutrition and health, the researchers did not rely on study participants reporting their diet, but instead measured flavanol intake objectively using nutritional biomarkers - indicators of dietary intake, metabolism or nutritional status that are present in our blood.The difference in blood pressure between those with the lowest 10% of flavanol intake and those with the highest 10% of intake was between 2 and 4 mmHg. 

- Notably, the effect was more pronounced in participants with hypertension.Professor Gunter Kuhnle, a nutritionist at the University of Reading who led the study said:"Previous studies of large populations have always relied on self-reported data to draw conclusions, but this is the first epidemiological study of this scale to objectively investigate the association between a specific bioactive compound and health. 

- This suggests if the general public increased its flavanol intake, there could be an overall reduction in cardiovascular disease incidence.Hagen Schroeter, Chief Science Officer at Mars Edge, said:"This study adds key insights to a growing body of evidence supporting the benefits of dietary flavanols in health and nutrition. 

- This connection may explain the high incidence of cancer among those who consume large amounts of dairy products and red meat, similar to the link between high cholesterol and an increased risk of heart disease.The study was led by Dr. Vered Padler-Karavani of the Department of Cell Research and Immunology at the Shmunis School of Biomedicine and Cancer Research at Tel Aviv University's George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences. 

- Padler-Karavani adds that this combination of methods allowed the researchers to predict that those who eat a lot of red meat and cheese will develop high levels and a different variety of the antibodies, and therefore may be at higher risk for cancer - especially colorectal cancer, but other cancers as well.Study finds association between lignan and stilbene intake and improvements in cognitive functionNavarra Institute for Health Research (Spain), October 20, 2020According to news reporting from Pamplona, Spain, research stated, “The global growing rates of cognitive decline and dementia, together with the absence of curative therapies for these conditions, support the interest in researching potential primary prevention interventions, with particular focus on dietary habits. 

- The aim was to assess the association between the intake of polyphenols, lignans and stilbene (primarily found in grapes and berries) and 6-year change in cognitive function in the ‘Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra’ (SUN) Project, a Spanish prospective cohort study.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Navarra Institute for Health Research, “Changes (final -initial) in cognitive function were evaluated in a subsample of 806 participants (mean age 66 years (SD 5), 69.7% male) of the SUN Project using the validated Spanish Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified (STICS-m) score. 

- Olive oil and nuts were the major sources of variability in lignan intake; and wine  in stilbene  intake.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “The results suggest that lignan and stilbene intake was associated with improvements in cognitive function.”This research has been peer-reviewed.Bacterial metabolism of dietary soy may lower risk factor for dementiaUniversity of Pittsburgh, Oct. 22, 2020A metabolite produced following consumption of dietary soy may decrease a key risk factor for dementia--with the help of the right bacteria, according to a new discovery led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health.Their study, published today in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions, reports that elderly Japanese men and women who produce equol--a metabolite of dietary soy created by certain types of gut bacteria--display lower levels of white matter lesions within the brain. 

- "White matter lesions are significant risk factors for cognitive decline, dementia and all-cause mortality," said lead author Akira Sekikawa, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of epidemiology at Pitt Public Health. 

- Participants were sorted by their equol production status, and then six to nine years later underwent brain imaging to detect levels of white matter lesions and deposits of amyloid-beta, which is the suspected molecular cause of Alzheimer's disease.The researchers found that while equol production did not appear to impact levels of amyloid-beta deposited within the brain, it was associated with reduced white matter lesion volumes. 

- Sekikawa's team also discovered that high levels of isoflavones--soy nutrients that are metabolized into equol--had no effect on levels of white matter lesions or amyloid-beta when equol wasn't produced.According to Sekikawa, the ability to produce equol from soy isoflavones may be the key to unlocking protective health benefits from a soy-rich diet, and his team has previously shown that equol production is associated with a lower risk of heart disease. 

- As heart disease is strongly associated with cognitive decline and dementia, equol production could help protect the aging brain as well as the heart.Epidemiological studies in Japan, where soy is regularly consumed, have shown that dietary intake of soy isoflavones has been linked to a lower risk for heart disease and dementia. 

- These findings suggest that creatinine:cystatin C ratio may be a simple, useful tool for mortality risk assessment in critically ill patients who develop AKI.Glutathione precursor GlyNAC reverses premature aging in people with HIVBaylor College of Medicine, October 16, 2020Premature aging in people with HIV is now recognized as a new, significant public health challenge. 

- For instance, declining gait speed, physical function and cognition, mitochondrial aging, elevated inflammation, immune dysfunction, frailty and other health conditions are significantly higher in people with HIV when compared to age- and sex-matched uninfected people.At Baylor College of Medicine, endocrinologist Dr. Rajagopal Sekhar, associate professor of medicine-endocrinology, and his team have found themselves in the right place at the right time to study premature aging in people with HIV. 

- Also, for the last 17 years, Sekhar has been active in HIV research, and has been providing clinical care for patients at the HIV clinic at Thomas Street Health Center, a part of Houston's Harris Health System, where he runs the sole endocrinology and metabolism clinic.Sekhar's years-long expertise, knowledge and interest in metabolic disorders affecting HIV patients and a parallel track investigating non-HIV people have resulted in the publication of significant discoveries regarding the metabolic complications in aging, HIV and diabetes, and has guided numerous clinical trials that together provide a better understanding of why we age. 

- "When the mitochondrial batteries are running low on power, as a medical and scientific community, we do not know how to recharge these batteries," Sekhar said. 

- "It was encouraging to see that GlyNAC can reverse many of these hallmark defects in people with HIV as there is no current treatment known to reverse these abnormalities. 

- Our findings could have implications beyond HIV and need further investigation," Sekhar said.Overall, these findings in HIV patients provide proof-of-concept that dietary supplementation of GlyNAC improves multiple hallmarks of aging and that glutathione deficiency and oxidative stress could contribute to them.Encouraged by these results, Sekhar has continued his investigations by testing the value of GlyNAC supplementation for improving the health of the growing older population, and has completed an open label trial, and another NIH-funded, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in older adults. 

- "The results from these recently completed trials support the findings of the HIV study," said Sekhar, who is currently the Principal Investigator of two NIH-funded randomized clinical trials studying the effect of GlyNAC in older humans with mild cognitive impairment, and with Alzheimer's disease.Greater adherence to aspects of Mediterranean diet associated with lower mortality risk among men during seven-year follow-upIRCCS Foundation National Cancer Institute (Italy), October 22, 2020According to news originating from Milan, Italy, research stated, “The present study analyzes the relation between diet and all-cause mortality in a cohort of Italian men residing in different regions of Italy. 

- This study, focusing on a homogenous cohort characterized by a varied intake and high intake of monounsaturated fats, confirms the inverse association between a Mediterranean type diet and mortality and points out that the nature of the MUFA may be relevant for their effects on health.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “In addition, the study confirms that fats of animal origins and dietary sugar are associated with an overall deleterious effect on mortality.”

- Fine particles, on the other hand, are usually about 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM 2.5) or smaller and contain combustion particles, secondary aerosols and recondensed organic and metal vapors.Due to their composition, fine particles pose considerable health risks. 

- Exposure to high levels of PM 2.5 can also affect lung function and worsen conditions like asthma, lung cancer and heart disease.Inhalation of PM 2.5 has been linked to lung injury caused by the loss of vascular barrier integrity. 

- The extract also reduced vascular protein leakage, immune cell infiltration and proinflammatory signaling protein release in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken from PM-exposed lung tissues.Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that black ginseng protects against PM-induced inflammatory lung injury and vascular hyperpermeability.Study shows active older adults have better physical and mental healthAmerican Cancer Society, October 20, 2020Older adults with higher physical activity and lower sitting time have better overall physical and mental health, according to a new study from the American Cancer Society (ACS). 

- The study, appearing in the journal, CANCER, suggests that higher amounts of regular moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and lower duration of sedentary time is associated with higher global mental and physical health for older cancer survivors and older adults, in general.With a rapidly aging population and nearly 16.9 million cancer survivors in the United States today, there is a need to identify strategies associated with healthy aging and improving quality of life for aging cancer survivors. 

- Being physically active is related to several health benefits, and in this study, ACS investigators led by Dr. Erika Rees-Punia analyzed self-reported aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activities, sitting time, and mental and physical health among nearly 78,000 participants in the ACS's Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. 

- Participants (average age 78 years) included older cancer survivors up to 10 years post-diagnosis, and cancer-free adults.The investigators found that regardless of cancer history, the differences in global mental and physical health between the most and least active, and the least and most sedentary, were clinically meaningful. 

- "The findings reinforce the importance of moving more and sitting less for both physical and mental health, no matter your age or history of cancer," said Rees-Punia. 

- "Previous studies in the general population have suggested that both green tea and coffee have health benefits, including preventing chronic diseases and reducing mortality, the team noted, adding that few studies, however, have been conducted in patients with diabetes.Still not fully understood are the mechanisms involved, the researchers said. 

- Green tea contains substances that may have health benefits, including phenolic compounds, theanine, and caffeine, and epigallocatechin gallate, the most prevalent phenolic compound, has been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-mutagenic properties.Coffee also contains phenolic compounds and caffeine, as well as other bioactive components that may have favorable health effects, Iwase and co-authors explained. 

- In the analysis, the researchers adjusted for potential risk or protective factors for mortality including age, sex, body mass index, diabetes duration, smoking, alcohol intake, sleep duration, glycated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, history of cardiovascular disease, and cancer. 

- The main causes of death were cancer (114 patients) and cardiovascular disease (76). 

- The researchers found that honey bee venom and its major component, melittin, can effectively kill cancer cells, even those that belong to one of the most aggressive types of cancer.Honey bee venom: a venom that could save livesApitherapy is the ancient medicinal practice of using bee products, namely, honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly and bee venom, for disease prevention and treatment purposes. 

- Melittin showed that it could enhance the effect of docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic drug used to suppress the growth of breast tumors, in mice.“Honeybee venom is available globally and offers cost-effective and easily accessible treatment options in remote or less-developed regions. 

- Further research will be required to assess whether the venom of some genotypes of bees has more potent or specific anticancer activities, which could then be exploited.”“Overall, our results could be leveraged to aid the development of new therapeutic modalities for many cancer types associated with frequent drug resistance and poor prognosis,” the researchers concluded in their report.Improved mental and physical condition is directly linked to nutrition, study showsNew research demonstrates that the right nutrition is directly linked to physical and cognitive performance in active duty men and women in US Air ForceUniversity of Illinois, Abbott Labs, US Air Force Research Lab, October 19, 2020Researchers at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Abbott and, the U.S. Air Force Research Lab announced today the results of a new study that found a direct link between physical fitness, cognitive performance, and optimal nutrition. 

- The scientists revealed that getting the right nutrition not only fuels our bodies and improves fitness, but gives us an edge mentally, too.The double-blind study, published this week in the journal Scientific Reports, examined the effectiveness of optimal nutrition and exercise to enhance fitness and cognitive performance among a population of active-duty men and women in the U.S. Air Force. 

- Seventy participants also received a nutritional drink twice per day that contained protein, carbohydrates and fat, as well as calcium beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), choline, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), folic acid, lutein, magnesium, phospholipids, zinc and vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, C, D and E. The remainder of the participants received a placebo drink that contained protein, carbohydrates and fat. 

- Both groups performed the same training program, which included a balanced exercise program comprised of aerobic and resistance training performed five days per week. 

- Resting heart rate improved from 71 beats per minute to 65 beats per minute"The physical and mental health benefits of exercise are well known, but this study demonstrates how optimal nutrition can help boost brain function as well," said lead study author, Chris Zwilling, Ph.D, a postdoctoral researcher working with the study's principal investigator Aron Barbey, Ph.D. at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois. 

- "FUELING BODY AND BRAIN"Abbott has been researching the impact of nutrition on brain function for more than a decade," said Matthew Kuchan, Ph.D., a research fellow and brain health scientist at Abbott and co-author of the study. 

- "These results confirm that by combining the right nutrition and exercise, people who are facing high-pressure situations can stay sharp physically and mentally when they need it most. 

- The nutrition formulation also included protein, vitamin D, and HMB to support muscle health. 

- "It is clear that nutrition is a critical component for developing and maintaining the physical and cognitive performance of the men and women in the U.S. Air Force," said Adam Strang, Ph.D., and lead investigator with the Air Force Research Laboratory. 

- "This research confirms that a nutritional supplement with the right nutrients can support and facilitate those improvements when paired with balanced exercise training. 

- They found that experience levels for most players rose, as well—in the modern age, professional chess players play a lot more matches than did those a century ago.Significant link found between air pollution and neurological disordersHarvard University, Emory University, Columbia University, October 19, 2020Air pollution was significantly associated with an increased risk of hospital admissions for several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementias, in a long-term study of more than 63 million older U.S. adults, led by researchers at Harvard T.H. 

- Chan School of Public Health.The study, conducted with colleagues at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, is the first nationwide analysis of the link between fine particulate (PM2.5) pollution and neurodegenerative diseases in the U.S. 

- The researchers leveraged an unparalleled amount of data compared to any previous study of air pollution and neurological disorders.The study will be published online October 19, 2020 in The Lancet Planetary Health. 

- "Our study builds on the small but emerging evidence base indicating that long-term PM2.5 exposures are linked to an increased risk of neurological health deterioration, even at PM2.5 concentrations well below the current national standards. 

- Taking into account potential confounding factors like socioeconomic status, they found that, for each 5 microgram per cubic meter of air (μg/m3) increase in annual PM2.5 concentrations, there was a 13% increased risk for first-time hospital admissions both for Parkinson's disease and for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. 

- The highest risk for first-time Parkinson's disease hospital admissions was among older adults in the northeastern U.S. For first-time Alzheimer's disease and related dementias hospital admissions, older adults in the Midwest faced the highest risk. 

- "Our U.S.-wide study shows that the current standards are not protecting the aging American population enough, highlighting the need for stricter standards and policies that help further reduce PM2.5 concentrations and improve air quality overall," said Antonella Zanobetti, principal research scientist in Harvard Chan School's Department of Environmental Health and co-senior author of the study. 

- The Gary Null Show is here to inform you on the best news in health, healing, the environment.Wagging The Dog Pt 1 The Story Behind The Story Of Covid19EGCG sensitizes chemotherapeutic-induced cytotoxicity  in multiple cancer cell linesUniversity of California at Davis, October 18, 2020According to news reporting originating in Davis, California, research stated, “Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major polyphenol component of green tea, presents anticancer efficacy. 

- Mechanistically, EGCG reduced ERK phosphorylation concentration-dependently, and sensitized gemcitabine, 5-FU, and doxorubicin to further suppress ERK phosphorylation in multiple cancer cell lines.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “EGCG presents a strong anticancer effect in pancreatic, colon, and lung cancer cells and is a robust combination partner for multiple chemotherapeutics as evidenced by reducing cancer cell growth, in part, by inhibiting the ERK pathway.”Exercise and nutrition regimen benefits physical, cognitive healthUniversity of Illinois, October 19, 2020Researchers studied the effects of a 12-week exercise regimen on 148 active-duty Air Force airmen, half of whom also received a twice-daily nutrient beverage that included protein; the omega-3 fatty acid, DHA; lutein; phospholipids; vitamin D; B vitamins and other micronutrients; along with a muscle-promoting compound known as HMB. 

- The exercise regimen combined strength training and high-intensity interval aerobic fitness challenges. 

- "The exercise intervention alone improved strength and endurance, mobility and stability, and participants also saw increases in several measures of cognitive function. 

- "But we also wanted to know whether taking the supplement conferred an advantage above and beyond the effect of exercise," Zwilling said. 

- The U. of I. team also worked with research fellow and study co-author Tapas Das and his colleagues at Abbott Nutrition, who led the design of the nutritional beverage, which is a mixture of nutrients targeting both muscle and brain. 

- Strainprint's app is intended to help users determine which types of cannabis work the best for them, but the company provided the WSU researchers free access to users' anonymized data for research purposes.Cuttler said this study points out that further research, particularly clinical trials on the cannabis constituent CBD, may reveal a therapeutic potential for people with OCD.This is the fourth study Cuttler and her colleagues have conducted examining the effects of cannabis on various mental health conditions using the data provided by the app created by the Canadian company Strainprint. 

- Those whose diet met the adequate intake of vitamin K were likelier to have a greater intake of vegetables, calcium, vitamin A and vitamin E in comparison with those whose intake was lower.Authors Chad Wessinger of the University of Maryland School of Medicine and colleagues remarked that vitamin K has a role in the prevention of vascular calcification and noted that “The potential relationship between vitamin K intake and cardiometabolic disease introduces vitamin K intake as a conceivable additional measure when assessing chronic stroke survivors’ risk of recurrence.”“Due to vitamin K’s potential therapeutic interactions with various diseases, controlled supplementation may be indicated for individuals struggling to consume adequate amounts,” they wrote. 

- “Vitamin K supplementation should be considered as a potential adjuvant therapy to address atherosclerosis.”Regular social engagement linked to healthier brain microstructure in older adultsUniversity of Pittsburgh, October 19, 2020Older people who report greater levels of social engagement have more robust gray matter in regions of the brain relevant in dementia, according to new research led by scientists at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. 

- It is the first to use a particularly sensitive type of brain imaging to conduct such an evaluation.The findings, reported today in the Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences, suggest that "prescribing" socialization could benefit older adults in warding off dementia, much the way prescribing physical activity can help to prevent diabetes or heart disease. 

- "Our data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, but I believe our findings are particularly important right now, since a one-size-fits-all social isolation of all older adults may place them at risk for conditions such as dementia," said lead author Cynthia Felix, M.D., M.P.H., a geriatrician and a post-doctoral associate in Pitt Public Health's Department of Epidemiology. 

- "Older adults should know it is important for their brain health that they still seek out social engagement in safe and balanced ways during the pandemic. 

- "Felix and her colleagues used information about social engagement from 293 community-dwelling participants from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study. 

- Maintaining brain health is of critical importance. 

- "There is no cure for dementia, which has tremendous costs in terms of treatment and caregiving. 

- Or is it that having a healthy brain results in better social engagement?Similar to how large public health studies assess the best programs to encourage physical activity to prevent chronic disease in older people, Felix believes her team's findings, coupled with previous research, provides justification for randomized control trials to assess the impact of specific types and amounts of social activities on brain health.Enriched by her prior public health training at Johns Hopkins University, Felix recognizes the critical role of public health in applying this finding on a large scale. 

- "It would be good if we develop programs across the U.S. through which structured social activities can be prescribed for community-dwelling older adults, aimed at reducing rates of dementia and the resulting health care costs," Felix said. 

- Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between the Q1 group and cognitive decline (MMSE
The Barbarians at the Pandemic’s GatesRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, October 20, 2020As we approach the the end of 2020, it is apropos to stop, turn around and carefully and objectively examine how we got fixed into this destructive quagmire of Covid-19 half truths, full lies and manufactured medical science. 

- Historically we are a nation that more often than not has sided with the judgments of our public health officials. 

- The average person has a difficult time challenging the authorities that run our medical system. 

- Not only has the American medical system and our federal health agencies been exposed to be naked, we are also discovering we cannot rely on their epistemological statistics, mathematical computer modeling, the FDA’s latest approved drug and vaccine, and surely not our decrepit healthcare system to account for our flawed health policies.Aside from the pandemic's toll on people's lives, there is also its impact upon the national and global economies at large that is rarely discussed. 

- According to the Commonwealth Fund about 7.7 million works with Employer Sponsored Insurance have lost jobs during the crisis, which totals 14.6 million after including their health insurance to cover dependents. 

- You have no income or savings and no health insurance. 

- The pandemic is not solely a health crisis; it is also an existential crisis, an impasse in the global civilization that is forcing us to realize that our over dependence and perverse reliance upon natural resources, such as fuel, energy, food and corrupt banking and healthcare services, is fragile. 

- But it is living a life that is founded upon simplicity, insight and wisdom, and community rather than consumption and competitive power.Now over 40,000 international medical professionals and almost half a million citizens have signed the Great Barrington Declaration to demand the reopening of national economies and to bring lockdowns to an end. 

- The Gary Null Show is here to inform you on the best news in health, healing, the environment. 

- The therapeutic effects of ginseng against Alzheimer’s disease. 

- As panic increases and more cases are reported daily, health-minded people are eager or even desperate to know whether there are ways to strengthen the body's immune system to offer some protection from this specific upper respiratory infection.There are six known strains of coronavirus, four which are associated with the common cold or moderate respiratory infections. 

- Consequently, since coronavirus is most often responsible for a flu-like common cold, recommended prevention and treatment protocols are largely similar to the flu.During a recent coronavirus task force meeting, Trump asked whether the flu vaccine would protect against the coronavirus. 

- That same month, the prestigious journal Vaccine, published a study conducted by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. 

- In other words, the results suggest that receiving the flu shot may increase one's risk of contracting another infectious virus by almost 100 percent.A recent analysis out of China reviewing rates of infection, targeted populations and mortality reported that the worst hit group is older people, particularly those who have immune-compromised conditions: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory illnesses, etc. 

- It is estimated that 60% of American adults have at least one underlying health condition and 40% have two or more. 

- For example, 33 million have diabetes and an estimated 84 million are pre-diabetic; heart disease affects 121 million and there are approximately 1.7 million new cancer diagnoses annually. 

- In fact, last month a study was released by Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University in the Journal of Medical Virology recommending that patients' nutritional status should be evaluated before any conventional treatment. 

- The hospital recommended a regimen that included Vitamins A, B, C, D, E, Omega-3, Selenium, Zinc, gammaglobulin A administered intravenously and Chinese traditional medicineTherefore we have scoured the peer-reviewed literature on the National Institutes of Health's Library of Medicine database to identify compelling studies that may warrant vitamin, antioxidant, and botanical supplementation as a means to protect ourselves from coronavirus and other viral infections. 

- This is just a summary of some important scientific information for you to make better informed decisions for protecting yourself while the coronavirus wends its course.BOTANICALSAstragulusIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), coronaviral infections belong to a specific epidemic disease category. 

- The US Department of Agriculture's Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory found it inhibits avian flu viruses.Jinlin Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China conducted a study published in the journal Microbiological Pathology that concluded"Astragulus exhibits antiviral properties that can treat infectious bronchitis caused by [avian] coronavirus"In China, which has a large poultry industry, avian coronaviruses are a serious threat to chicken farmers. 

- A primary ingredient in these formulas' was astragulus.Earlier in February, researchers at Beijing Children's Hospital at the Capital Medical University provided a thorough overview of recommended diagnostic procedures and treatments for specific symptoms witnessed in the current Covid19 infections that included both allopathic and traditional Chinese medicine. 

- Therefore it was an unexpected surprise to discover that there is notable research on glycyrrihizin's effectiveness against coronavirus and in particular SARS.Japan's National Institute of Infectious Disease reported GL's effectiveness against coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as Epstein Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus. 

- After the deadly SARS outbreak in 2012, virologists at Frankfurt University Medical School investigated several antiviral compounds to treat patients admitted with SARS coronavirus infections. 

- The scientists concluded that "Our findings suggest that glycyrrhizin should be assessed for treatment of SARS. 

- That study was published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry. 

- Cytokine activity for IL-1, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 all significantly increased thereby confirming its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.Another Israeli study by Hebrew University in Jerusalem and published in the Journal of Internal Medical Research found that participants enrolled with existing flu like symptoms who took 15 ml of elderberry syrup 4 times a day recovered four days earlier than those on medications or a placebo.Finally, a more recent 2019 study by the University of Sydney observed that certain compounds in elderberry inhibit the flu virus's entry and replication in human cells.However, there is also research showing elderberry's positive impact on coronavirus infections.In 2014, researchers at Emory University noted that elderberry extract inhibited coronavirus virility at the point of infection. 

- The scientists hypothesized that elderberry rendered the virus non infectious.One of the better studies came out of National Sun Yat Sen University and the China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan in 2019. 

- One advantage of olive leaf is that it is highly bioavailable to the body's cells.There are almost 10,000 studies in the National Institutes of Health literature database referring to OLE, olive leaf, and olive oil, most with respect to its strong antioxidant and anticancer properties. 

- Therefore might olive leaf extract contribute to the treatment for this new coronavirus strain?New York University biochemists identified olive leaf extract's anti-HIV activity to modulate the host cell gene expression due to HIV infection. 

- The conclusions state, "Treatment with OLE reverses many of these HIV-1 infection-associated changes." 

- Another joint study by NYU and Harvard Medical School concluded that OLE from olive leaf is "a unique class of HIV-1 inhibitors" and is "effective against viral fusion and integration. 

- The most recent research into Covid19's surface life -- living outside of an animal host -- is 9 days.Other BotanicalsSaikosaponins is an important family of compounds found in the Bupleurum plant, which has been shown to have possible anti-coronavirus properties.Kaohsiung Medical University in Taiwan examined many of the derivatives of saikosaponins and observed it has very potent anti-coronaviral activity that interferes with the early stage of the virus' replication. 

- Several companies offer Bupleurum onlineUniversity College Dublin and Sichuan Agricultural University conducted a systematic meta-review of the existing medical literature on Chinese herbs that may prevent and treat viral respiratory infections. 

- The scientists recommend that NAC should be included as an additional treatment option in the case of an influenza A pandemic.An Italian randomized placebo study conducted at the University of Genoa found that subjects who were already suspected of having contact with the H1N1 flu virus who were placed under NAC treatment had a 25% rate of experiencing symptoms compared to 79% in the placebo group.Certain cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor and IL-6, have been associated with the pathogenesis of influenza and can increase the risk of mortality. 

- One large study by Japan's National Defense Medical College Research Institute, published in the Journal of Molecular Sciences, recommended that Japanese healthcare workers take nanosilver to protect them from viruses including coronavirus.In 2010, the University of Naples measured silver nanoparticles' capabilities to reduce and prevent infection from the parainfluenza type 3 virus. 

- Additionally, according to a study out of Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health, the incubation period is estimated at 5.1 days for being infected and capable of infecting others without displaying symptoms. 

- But there is no mention in the medical community nor the mainstream media about what we can do to strengthen our immune system.Yes, a high quality 99% barrier mask is important, especially if worn in a crowded environment.

The efficacy of Chinese medicine for the treatment of acute and critical medical conditionsUniversity of Chicago and China Medical University (Taiwan), October 1, 2020Researchers at the China Medical University in Taiwan and the University of Chicago discussed the theory of Chinese medicine and its application in the treatment of acute and critical medical conditions, including epidemics. 

- Their review was published in The American Journal of Chinese Medicine.In developed nations and Eastern countries, western medicine is routinely used for treatment while traditional medicine is only used by a select few as a complement to modern medicines.But research shows Chinese medicine can also be an effective treatment for chronic diseases, especially in cases when western medicine fails to produce the desired results.Many studies have also demonstrated how Chinese medicine can be useful in the management of acute and critical illnesses.Chinese medicine has a holistic view of the human body and emphasizes individualization based on body balance and mind-body interactions.Some of the most frequently employed therapies in Chinese medicine are herbal medicines and acupuncture.The researchers explored the use of this ancient therapy as a complementary medicine in modern times, particularly for the management of serious medical conditions, such as SARS, acute heart diseases and ischemic cerebral stroke.The researchers also believe that well-designed controlled clinical trials are urgently needed to prove the safety and effectiveness of Chinese medicine, as well as to promote its application.Citrus peel nobiletin ameliorates high-fat diet-induced vascular and renal changes by decreasing inflammationMahasarakham University (Thailand), September 25, 2020According to news reporting from Maha Sarakham, Thailand, research stated, “We investigate the effect of nobiletin, a flavonoid in citrus peels, on vascular and renal alterations and possible mechanisms involved in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats. 

- In addition, an increase of plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) was significantly attenuated after nobiletin treatment.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “Our results suggest that nobiletin attenuates HFD-induced vascular and renal alterations in rats, which is possibly related to the modulation of AdipoR1 and TGF-b1expression, and suppression of inflammation.”From San Diego to Italy, study suggests wisdom can protect against lonelinessCross-cultural study finds a strong inverse correlation between loneliness and wisdomUniversity of California San Diego, October 1, 2020Over the last few decades, there has been growing concern about loneliness across all ages, particularly in middle-aged and older adults. 

- Loneliness, defined as feeling isolated or not having an adequate number of meaningful personal connections, is consistently associated with unhealthy aging and has been identified as a major risk factor for overall adverse health outcomes.In a recent cross-cultural study, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and University of Rome La Sapienza examined middle-aged and older adults in San Diego and Cilento, Italy and found loneliness and wisdom had a strong negative correlation.The study, publishing in the October 1, 2020 online edition of Aging and Mental Health, suggests wisdom may be a protective factor against loneliness. 

- "Loneliness was consistently associated with poor general health, worse quality of sleep and less happiness, whereas the reverse was generally true for wisdom. 

- "If we can increase someone's compassion, wisdom is likely to go up and loneliness is likely to go down," said David Brenner, MD, vice chancellor of UC San Diego Health Sciences. 

- "Jeste said studies that examine how to decrease loneliness as people age will be critical for effective interventions and the future of health care. 

- Next steps will include testing an intervention to increase compassion for reducing loneliness.Cannabinoids associated with negative respiratory health effects in older adults with COPDResearchers publish first data on the impact of cannabinoids on the respiratory health of individuals with COPDSt Michaels Hospital (Toronto), September30, 2020Cannabinoids, a class of prescription pills that contain synthetically-made chemicals found in marijuana, are associated with a 64 per cent increase in death among older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), according to the first published data on the impact of cannabinoids on the respiratory health of individuals with the lung disease.The findings, published Wednesday in Thorax, have significant clinical implications as more physicians prescribe cannabinoids to patients with COPD to treat chronic muscle pain, difficulty sleeping and breathlessness.The study, led by St. Michael's Hospital of Unity Health Toronto, found that cannabinoids can contribute to negative respiratory health events in people with COPD, including hospitalization and death. 

- COPD is a progressive lung disease that causes difficulty breathing and chronic productive coughing, and can be associated with a variety of non-respiratory issues, like chronic muscle pain and insomnia. 

- "The study analyzed the health data of over 4,000 individuals in Ontario ages 66 years and older with COPD from 2006 to 2016. 

- Older adults in Ontario with COPD who were new cannabinoid users represented 1.1 per cent of the data, which was made available by ICES.Researchers observed particularly worse health outcomes among patients with COPD who were using higher doses of cannabinoids. 

- The research team did not find evidence to support that cannabinoids were a safer choice over opioids for older adults with COPD in so far as respiratory health outcomes.Study identifies exercise as key to halting progress from diabetes to heart diseaseUniversity of Otago (New Zealand), September 30, 2020An international study led by the University of Otago has revealed how exercise can reduce the chance of diabetes leading on to heart disease.The research has identified that exercisetriggers the release of small sequences of genetic code in the heart called microRNA, which increase protein production to improve heart structure and function.The study, "Exercise regulates microRNAs to preserve coronary and cardiac function in the diabetic heart," has recently been published in the journal Circulation Research.Associate Professors Daryl Schwenke and Rajesh Katare, of Otago's Department of Physiology, found that specific microRNA are adversely altered in the early stages of diabetes. 

- These altered microRNA can reliably predict the inevitable onset of heart disease. 

- Associate Professor Katare believes this is a pivotal new development as microRNA can serve as a reliable early biomarker for heart disease in diabetes. 

- "We've proven that by using exercise as a treatment, we can increase good microRNA, and reduce bad microRNA from causing damage. 

- Exercise effectively improves regulation of microRNA to prevent the onset and progression of heart disease," Associate Professor Schwenke says.Along with highlighting the role of exercise in regulating microRNA, the study also shows that microRNA are a potential novel target for the therapeutic treatment of heart disease in people with chronic diabetes. 

- "By increasing the good microRNA using pharmacological drugs it is possible to effectively reduce heart disease in diabetic subjects. 

- This approach is not solely reliant on exercise," Associate Professor Schwenke says.Over 250,000 thousand New Zealanders have diabetes according to the Ministry of Health, which defines diabetes as a serious health challenge to our country.Associate Professor Schwenke believes this research has clear long-term benefits on both the quality of life for diabetic patients with heart disease, as well as alleviating the economic burden associated with current treatment of diabetes. 

- "By understanding the physiological role of microRNA we can see without doubt the positive role of exercise in preventing diabetic heart disease," he adds.S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) rescues cognitive deficits in animal researchUniversity of Melbourne (Australia), September 28, 2020According to news reporting originating in Parkville, Australia, research stated, “Alterations in the methionine cycle and abnormal tau phosphorylation are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. 

- Treatment with S-adenosylmethionine increased the Y-maze novel arm exploration time and increased both the expression and activity of protein phosphatase 2A. 

- Furthermore, treatment reduced the number of AT8 positive neurons and reduced the expression of phosphorylated tau (Ser202/Thr205). 

- It was published Sept. 14 in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 

- "Adolescence (is) a sensitive period of early life when structural facets of social relationships can have lasting mental health consequences," wrote Copeland.Overall, the study found for both men and women, naming few friends predicts higher depressive levels through adolescence into adulthood. 

- "Compared to boys, girls face additional risks from how others view their social position in adolescence," Copeland wrote.This current study used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, specifically social network data asking students to select up to five male friends and five female friends.They were also asked to indicate how often they felt depressed. 

- Her research joins social network analysis and medical sociology to examine how social relationships can benefit or introduce risks to health across the life course.Study study finds association between screen time use, diet and other health factorsArizona State University, September 29, 2020The era of the television brought with it the TV dinner -- a fast, convenient meal that, while nutritionally questionable, meant the whole family could gather together on the sofa to enjoy "The Ed Sullivan Show" and eat their Swanson Salisbury steak, too.Over the next several decades, advancements in technology and the ubiquity of streaming services has allowed for the proliferation of binge-watching culture, where hours spent sedentary rack up faster than "Jeopardy" points, and greasy fast food is only a few taps on your smartphone away.Chris Wharton, assistant dean of innovation and strategic initiatives at Arizona State University's College of Health Solutions, whose research interests include lifestylewide behavior change, wanted to know what kind of relationship the time we spend in front of screens has with various health behaviors and factors.In a study recently published in BMC Public Health, one of the largest open access public health journals in the world, Wharton found that heavy users of screens -- defined as those who use screens an average of 17.5 hours per day -- reported the least healthful dietary patterns and the poorest health-related characteristics compared with moderate and light users, who averaged roughly 11.3 and 7 hours of screen use per day, respectively. 

- "But with the advancement of all these other types of devices that people use throughout the day, we wanted to see how health behaviors and factors are associated with a variety of screen-based devices. 

- "For the study, more than 900 adults across the U.S. who owned a television and at least one other device with a screen were asked to complete a survey to assess screen time use across multiple devices, dietary habits, sleep duration and quality, perceived stress, self-rated health, physical activity and body mass index.Among the findings, unique dietary habits were associated with different types of screen use such that heavy users of TV and smartphones displayed the least healthful dietary patterns compared with heavy users of TV-connected devices, laptops and tablets.Additionally, heavy users of smartphones reported the lowest quality of sleep. 

- But one of the simplest things people can do for their health when it comes to screens -- which is probably one of the hardest things to do because of the convenience and their addictive nature -- is putting all those devices down, in particular your smartphone, two hours before bedtime. 

- "That is, with the exception of laptops, which Wharton attributes to the likelihood that laptops are more often used for work than entertainment.Wharton said the results of this study lay the foundation for future research into screen time interventions because they give researchers insight into which negative health effects are associated with which types of devices. 

- We are nowhere near a conclusion like that, but I think we need to get there because screens have come to dominate us, and they drive real problems in our health." 

- So far it has been a completely non-transparent effort and only cherry-picked information trickles to the medical media. 

- It is good for the economy and terrible for health. 

- And the mainstream media fully supports this scheme without making any effort to seek outside the federal health regime second professional medical opinions. 

- Standardized extracts of G. biloba leaves have since been used for the treatment of mild to moderate age-related memory impairment, dementia and peripheral vascular diseases.According to the South Korean researchers, oxidative stress, or excess free radical production, induced by hypoxia — a condition in which tissues do not receive an adequate supply of oxygen — is linked to the pathogenesis of glaucoma. 

- They then gave the rats various concentrations of EGb 761 via intraperitoneal injection and measured RGC density to estimate cell survival.The researchers reported that treatment with 1 or 5?mcg/mL EGb 761 significantly increased the survival of RGC after exposure to oxidative stress. 

- In vivo, treatment with 100?mg/kg or 250?mg/kg EGb 761 also significantly improved RGC survival, proving the neuroprotective effects of G. biloba.Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that G. biloba leaves can be used to protect against hypoxic injury that leads to glaucoma.Dietary folate, magnesium, and dairy products may all help stave off bowel cancerService de Gastroenterologie (France), McGill University (Quebec), Erasmus University (Netherlands), September 29, 2020Folate, magnesium, and dairy products may all help stave off bowel cancer, but there's no evidence that garlic or onions, fish, tea or coffee protect against the disease, finds an overarching analysis of published pooled data analyses in the journal Gut.In the US alone around 1 in every 20 people is likely to develop bowel cancer at some point during their lifetime. 

- And worldwide, more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.1 million deaths from the disease are predicted every year by 2030.While deaths from the disease have been falling in most developed countries, the numbers of new cases have been rising in some, including in Canada, the UK, and the Netherlands.Screening for the disease can pick up the disease at an early treatable stage, but take-up varies considerably from country to country. 

- And as it takes more than 15 years for bowel cancer to develop, a healthy lifestyle likely has a key role in helping to halt or stop its progress altogether, say the researchers.They therefore trawled relevant research databases for published systematic reviews and meta-analyses (pooled data analyses) of clinical trials and observational studies assessing the impact of dietary and medicinal factors on bowel cancer risk.The medicinal factors included: aspirin; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as paracetamol; and statins.The dietary factors included: vitamins or supplements (magnesium, calcium, folic acid, vitamin A, B, C, E, D, β-carotene and selenium); coffee; tea; fish and omega 3 fatty acids; dairy products; fibre; fruit and vegetables; meat; and alcohol.They included relevant studies published in French or English between September 1980 and June 2019, but excluded those involving people at high risk of developing bowel cancer. 

- Some 80 articles out of a total of 343 were included in the overarching (umbrella) analysis of pooled data analyses.The results showed that aspirin is likely protective against bowel cancer, lowering the risk by between 14% and 29% at doses as low as 75 mg/day, with a dose-response effect reported up to 325 mg/day.NSAID use for up to 5 years was associated with a significant (26% to 43%) fall in the incidence of bowel cancer.Magnesium intake of at least 255 mg/day was associated with a 23% lower risk compared with the lowest intake, and high intake of folic acid was associated with a 12-15% lower risk, although it wasn't possible to pinpoint a threshold dose from the available data.Similarly, eating dairy products was associated with 13% to 19% lower risk of the disease. 

- But the small number of available meta-analyses, and the many different research outcomes and variety of dairy products included make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the quantities required to ward off the disease, caution the researchers.Fibre intake was associated with a 22%-43% lower risk, while fruit/vegetable intake was associated with up to a 52% lower risk, with added benefit for every additional 100 g/day increase in intake.Dietary soy intake was associated with a modest, but significant, fall (8-15%) in risk.But there was no evidence that vitamins E, C, or multivitamins were protective. 

- Similarly, there was no evidence that β-carotene or selenium helped stave off the disease.The data were weak or equivocal on the impact of tea; garlic or onions; vitamin D either alone or combined with calcium; coffee and caffeine; fish and omega 3; and inconsistent on the protective effect of vitamin A and the B vitamins.A modest protective effect was found in observational studies for high calcium intake, but a meta-analysis of clinical trial data found no protective effect, and even an increased risk.Similarly, although meta-analyses of observational studies suggest that statins may lower cancer risk, no positive effect was noted in meta-analyses of clinical trial data.Most of the available meta-analyses of observational studies reported an increased risk of between 12% and 21% for meat, particularly red and processed meat. 

- They are also a proven superfood, credited by researchers with the potential to prevent and help resolve many disease conditions.Now, a new Swiss study shows that urolithin A, a molecule produced when pomegranate is digested, could hold the key to rejuvenating cell mitochondria – and even prolonging the quality of your life. 

- This beneficial process, known as mitophagy, helps to ensure optimal cellular function.Mitophagy becomes less efficient with age, causing malfunctioning mitochondria to accumulate in cells – where they weaken muscle tissues and impair cellular health. 

- Researchers believe that these deposits of mitochondrial debris can trigger degenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, as well as decreased mobility and frailty in elderly people.This is where pomegranates come in…A molecule called urolithin A is produced by the body upon the digestion of two polyphenols – punicalagins and ellagitannins – that exist naturally in pomegranates. 

- By helping to enhance muscle function, urolithin A may help ward off the loss of mobility and general decline that can accompany weakened muscle tissue.Calling urolithin A a “promising approach to improving mitochondrial and muscle function in the aging population,” the team called for further research.Pomegranate has a proven ability to combat heart disease and cancerThe new study is not the first to reveal important health benefits from pomegranates – these tasty members of the berry family have been impressing researchers with their ability to combat serious degenerative diseases.In a recent review published in Advanced Biomedical Research, the authors noted that pomegranate can help prevent or treat a veritable laundry list of dangerous conditions known to trigger potentially life-threatening diseases – including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, oxidative stress, high blood sugar, atherosclerosis and inflammation.Interestingly, in some cases pomegranate has been found to work in much the same way as pharmaceutical medications. 

- Research has shown that they help to prevent accumulations of beta-amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer’s disease.Pomegranates owe much of their potent disease-fighting powers to their extraordinary antioxidant capabilities.The juice of a single pomegranate contains more than 40 percent of the RDA of vitamin C – itself a potent antioxidant and immune system booster. 

- Our study compared the effects of high-fiber and no-fiber diets, finding that a fiber-free diet is actually worse for subjects undergoing radiotherapy treatment. 

- "In Europe, approximately one million pelvic-organ cancer survivors suffer from compromised intestinal health due to radiation-induced gastrointestinal symptoms," Dr. Stringer says. 

- "This is also commonplace in Australia and around the world with no immediate cure or effective treatment. 

- If we can prevent some of inflammation resulting from radiation simply by adjusting dietary fiber levels, we could improve long-term, and possibly life-long, intestinal health among cancer survivors. 

- "Poor bone quality is linked to poor heart healthQueen Mary University of London and University of Southampton, September 28, 2020New research by Queen Mary University of London and the University of Southampton's Medical Research Council Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit (MRC LEU) has found associations between lower bone mineral density and worse cardiovascular health in both men and women.Published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, the study used the internationally unique UK Biobank cohort to investigate links between bone and cardiovascular health. 

- They used a combination of imaging and blood biomarker data to investigate the relationship in the largest sample of people reported to date.Osteoporosis and heart disease are important public health problems. 

- However, current research studies lack objective measures of bone and heart health and are often limited to studies of small numbers of people for relatively short periods of time.The researchers found that lower bone density was linked to greater arterial stiffness (indicating poor cardiovascular health) in both men and women. 

- They also found that individuals with poor bone health had an increased risk of dying from ischaemic heart disease. 

- She said: "Our study demonstrates clear links between bone disease and cardiovascular health. 

- "Professor Nick Harvey, Professor of Rheumatology and Clinical Epidemiology at the MRC LEU, University of Southampton, who supervised the work added: "The wealth of information available in the UK Biobank permitted a highly detailed analysis of the complex interactions between musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health, helping to elucidate potential underlying mechanism, and informing novel approaches to clinical risk assessment. 

- He comments: "Increasing our understanding of novel determinants of heart disease, such as the bone-heart axis, is key to improving disease prevention and treatment strategies and for improving population health. 

- "Professor Cyrus Cooper, Director of the MRC LEU, University of Southampton, added: "This study directly complements our program of research investigating the lifecourse determinants of musculoskeletal health and disease. 

- "Researchers Say THC From Cannabis May Treat Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, StudyUniversity of South Carolina, September 24, 2020Since Covid-19 first became a dangerous pandemic, many have wondered how cannabis use might factor into risk or healing for the deadly disease. 

- While some immediately assumed cannabis was harmful, like tobacco, and others assumed it could cure or preventthe disease, scientists quickly began to explore the question.Early research focused on the cannabinoid CBD as a potential treatment for cytokine storms and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - a symptom in severe cases of Covid-19, which can lead to death. 

- The results suggested that CBD may be an effective treatment, although human studies need to be conducted to confirm.Now, researchers are exploring whether another popular cannabinoid, THC, might help with treating the novel coronavirus. 

- Several studies point to CBD as a potential treatment for ARDS, and the FDA recently greenlighted clinical trials for a synthetic cannabinoid treatment for ARDS.In the new research, scientists explored whether THC might be able to treat cytokine storms and ARDS, by studying its effects on mice.In this animal model, researchers exposed two groups of healthy mice to a bacterial infection called Staphylococcus aureus or SEB. 

- In this case, however, the researchers gave one group of mice a treatment of THC right after they infected them with SEB, along with doses 24 and and 48 hours afterward.Amazingly, 100% of the mice who were given THC before being infected survived having SEB. 

- "Our findings not only demonstrate that meditation improves emotional health, but that people can acquire these benefits regardless of their 'natural' ability to be mindful," said Yanli Lin, an MSU graduate student and lead investigator of the study. 

- "Mindfulness, a moment-by-moment awareness of one's thoughts, feelings and sensations, has gained worldwide popularity as a way to promote health and well-being. 

- "Freezing prostate cancer: Study shows notable outcomes with cryoablationUniversity of California Los Angeles, September 28, 2020A less-invasive treatment technique called hemi-gland cryoablation (HGCryo) - destroying the areas of the prostate where cancers are located by freezing them - provides a high rate of effective prostate cancer control, according to a new study published in The Journal of Urology®, Official Journal of the American Urological Association (AUA). 

- One patient developed erectile dysfunction , which was successfully treated with medication.Cryotherapy is an FDA-approved treatment for prostate cancer and is increasingly popular as a less-invasive alternative to surgery. 

- Most studies of prostate cryoablation were performed before the availability of modern multiparametric MRI scanning of the prostate, which can provide "a targeted path to precise biopsy and focal treatment" in most men with prostate cancer.As with other types of partial gland ablation (PGA) for treatment of prostate cancer, the findings highlight the importance of follow-up biopsy as "the most important criterion for success" in evaluating the results of HGCryo. 

- "Early introduction of gluten may prevent celiac disease in childrenKings College London, September 28, 2020Introducing high doses of gluten from four months of age into infants' diets could prevent them from developing coeliac disease, a study has found.These results from the Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) Study, published today in JAMA Pediatrics, by researchers from King's College London, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, St George's, University of London, and Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, suggest the early introduction of high-dose gluten may be an effective prevention strategy for the disease, though researchers say further studies are needed before being applied in practice.Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease whereby eating gluten causes the body's immune system to attack its own tissues. 

- There are currently no strategies to prevent coeliac disease and treatment involves long-term exclusion of gluten from the diet. 

- Even very small amounts of gluten in the diet of those with coeliac disease can cause damage to the lining of the gut, prevent proper absorption of food and result in symptoms including bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and tiredness.Previous studies exploring early introduction of gluten in infants have varied in the amount of gluten consumed and the timing of the introduction. 

- This was in the form of two wheat-based cereal biscuits such as Weetabix, representing an age-appropriate portion of wheat.1004 children were tested for antitransglutanimase antibodies, an indicator of coeliac disease, at three years of age. 

- Those with raised antibody levels were referred for further testing by a specialist.The results showed that among children who delayed gluten introduction until after six months of age, the prevalence of coeliac disease at three years of age was higher than expected—1.4% of this group of 516 children. 

- In contrast, among the 488 children who introduced gluten from four months of age, there were no cases of coeliac disease.Lead author Professor Gideon Lack, Professor of Paediatric Allergy at King's College London and head of the children's allergy service at Evelina London Children's Hospital said: "This is the first study that provides evidence that early introduction of significant amounts of wheat into a baby's diet before six months of age may prevent the development of coeliac disease. 

- In contrast, the researchers noted that conventional farming required the use of fertilizers to ensure adequate plant nutrition.Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that organic farming is the best cultivation system to use as it ensures that crops receive proper nourishment, especially ample amounts of essential micronutrients.Common Antioxidant Enzyme Catalase May Provide Potential Treatment for Covid-19University of Caliornia Los Angeles, September 29, 2020Researchers from UCLA and China have found that catalase, a naturally occurring enzyme, holds potential as a low-cost therapeutic drug to treat COVID-19 symptoms and suppress the replication of coronavirus inside the body. 

- "In the meantime, our research suggests this enzyme could offer a very effective therapeutic solution for treatment of hyperinflammation that occurs due to SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as hyperinflammation generally. 

- "This work has far-reaching implications beyond the treatment of COVID-19. 

- Cytokine storm is a lethal condition that can complicate other infections, such as influenza, as well as non-infectious conditions, like autoimmune disease," said Dr. Gregory Fishbein, an author on the study and a pathologist at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine.Effects of one month of Common Yoga Protocol practice appear to be mediated by the angiogenic and neurogenic pathway: A pilot studyPost Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (India),  25 September 2020.AbstractObjectiveTo examine the molecular effects of mindful activities such as yoga and meditationDesignThis was an open label single arm exploratory yoga intervention study.Study participants64 healthy individuals within the age of 18-60 years were recruited for this one month yoga intervention study.InterventionCommon Yoga Protocol (CYP) is a standardized yoga protocol released by Ministry of AYUSH, India for International Yoga Day.

- "Evidence for Korean Ginseng's effects on improving bone healthHospital of Chonbuk National University, Sept. 9, 2019The Korea Ginseng Association introduced new evidence of Korean Ginseng's efficacy on bone health.Korean Ginseng refers to ginsengs produced in Korea. 

- It has been proven to improve immune system and fatigue previously, and now even for bone health, as seen in recent research released in Korea.In June of 2019, Rural Development Administration, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB) and Hospital of Chonbuk National University confirmed the efficacy of Korean ginseng's efficacy on bone health in a research conducted for 3 years and followed up for another two years. 

- The calcium concentration and bone formation effect were also higher in the test group.The Korea Ginseng Association's president Mr. Ban mentioned, "With this new evidence on ginseng's efficacy on bone health, we have even more pride for our Korean Ginseng. 

- The research, published Sept. 18 in the journal Science Immunology, suggests these immune cells may play a role other than protecting against microbial invaders—protecting our mental health.The results buttress an emerging theory that gamma interferons, a type of immune cell that helps induce and modulate a variety of immune system responses, may also play a role in preventing depression in healthy people. 

- "These T cells serve another purpose and we speculate that they may help preserve our mental health," he said.Hafler said that his lab and colleagues at Yale plan to explore how immune system responses in the central nervous system might affect psychiatric disorders such as depression.Avocado pulp improves cardiovascular and autonomic recovery following submaximal runningSao Paulo State University (Brazil), August 23, 2020AbstractPrevious studies have demonstrated that regular avocado consumption presents advantageous effects on cardiovascular system. 

- However, little attention has been paid to the use of avocado as a dietary supplement, in particular, for individuals involved in physical exercise training. 

- Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of acute avocado pulp intake on cardiovascular and autonomic recovery subsequent to moderate exercise. 

- After the ingestion of Avocado pulp or placebo, the subjects were seated for 60 min at rest, followed by running on a treadmill at a submaximal level and then remained seated for 60 min during recovery from the exercise. 

- Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) [rMSSD, SD1, HF (ms2)] and skin conductance were evaluated before and during exercise, as well as during recovery. 

- HR, systolic blood pressure, HRV and skin conductance recovered faster when subjects were given avocado pulp prior to exercise. 

- In conclusion, avocado pulp improved cardiovascular and autonomic recovery after exercise, suggesting a reduced risk of cardiovascular events after exertion. 

- "This is totally amazing - the brain is absolutely physically distorted by not having enough vitamin E," said Maret Traber, a professor in the OSU College of Public Health and Human Sciences.The study led by Traber, the Ava Helen Pauling Professor at Oregon State's Linus Pauling Institute, was published today in Scientific Reports.Zebrafish are a small freshwater species that go from a fertilized egg to a swimming fish in about five days. 

- "Joining Traber on the study were Brian Head of the Linus Pauling Institute, Jane La Du and Robyn Tanguay of the OSU College of Agricultural Sciences and Chrissa Kioussi of the OSU College of Pharmacy.The Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Lab supported the research with technical assistance, and the Ava Helen Pauling Endowment and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health contributed toward the study's funding.Lactobacillus rhamnosus attenuates bone loss and maintains bone healthAll India Medical Institute (India), September 18, 2020According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, “Osteoporosis is a systemic-skeletal disorder characterized by enhanced fragility of bones leading to increased rates of fractures and morbidity in large number of populations. 

- Probiotics are known to be involved in management of various-inflammatory diseases including osteoporosis.“But no study till date had delineated the immunomodulatory potential of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR) in bone-health.“In the present study, we examine the effect of probiotic-LR on bone-health in osteoporotic (Ovx) mice model.“We observed that administration of LR attenuated bone-loss in Ovx mice. 

- Altogether, the present study for the first time establishes the osteoprotective role of LR on bone-health, thus highlighting the potential of LR in the treatment and management of various bone related diseases including osteoporosis.”
Vitamin D supplementation can reduce cancer death risk by 16%, study showsCornell University, September 18, 2020A recent review published in the British Medical Journal analyzed studies on vitamin D supplementation. 

- For instance, previous research proposed that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of colon and prostate cancer.For the current study, the researchers looked at 52 randomized controlled trials that compared the effects of vitamin D supplementation to those of a placebo or no treatment. 

- The studies included almost 80,000 cancer patients with an average age of 68.They found that those who took vitamin D supplements for three years and more had a 13 percent reduced risk of cancer-related death.“The difference in the mortality rate between the vitamin D and placebo groups was statistically significant enough that it showed just how important it might be among the cancer population,” said lead author Tarek Haykal of the Michigan State University and the Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan.In another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers randomly assigned half of 25,800 participants to vitamin D supplementation and the other half to a placebo. 

- The new clinical trial, led by Professor David Kennedy, Director of the Brain, Performance and Nutrition Research Centre at Northumbria University and published in Nutrients, suggests a rapid and sustained boost for a wide range of cognitive functions after a single use of the ingredient. 

- A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, published in 2019, was conducted to determine whether a single dose of Zynamite administered one hour before exercise would increase cycle-sprint performance. 

- Mental health services need to be tailored to those most in need right now. 

- "In addition, the research highlights the connection between mental health and exposure to media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting the need to step away from the television, computer or smartphone to protect psychological well-being. 

- Using the NORC AmeriSpeak panel, the study was the first of its kind to examine early predictors of rising mental health problems across the nation. 

- "We also encourage the public to limit exposure to media as an important public health intervention. 

- It can prevent mental and physical health symptoms and promote resilience.

- "While people have survived on it for thousands of years there was a lack of basic scientific knowledge of the health impacts of a breadfruit-based diet in both humans and animals. 

- Doctoral student Ying Liu led the study examining the digestion and health impact of a breadfruit-based diet. 

- "Detailed and systematic studies of the health impacts of a breadfruit diet had not previously been conducted and we wanted to contribute to the development of breadfruit as a sustainable, environmentally-friendly and high-production crop," Liu says.The few studies done on the product have been to examine the glycemic index of breadfruit--with a low glycemic index it is comparable to many common staples such as wheat, cassava, yam and potatoes. 

- "The objective of our current study was to determine whether a diet containing breadfruit flour poses any serious health concerns," explains Liu, who conducted her research with colleagues from British Columbia Institute of Technology's Natural Health and Food Products Research Group and the Breadfruit Institute of the National Tropical Botanic Garden in Hawaii.The researchers designed a series of studies--using flour ground from dehydrated breadfruits--that could provide data on the impacts of a breadfruit-based diet fed to mice and also an enzyme digestion model.The researchers determined that breadfruit protein was found to be easier to digest than wheat protein in the enzyme digestion model. 

- "Fundamental understanding of the health impact of breadfruit digestion and diets is necessary and imperative to the establishment of breadfruit as a staple or as a functional food in the future. 

- "Fructose and glucose in high fructose corn syrup deliver a one-two punch to healthNew study links combination of the two sugars in high fructose corn syrup to heart health risksUniversity of California at Davis, September 17, 2020Consuming high fructose corn syrup appears to be as bad for your health as consuming sugar in the form of fructose alone, according to a new study from researchers at the University of California, Davis. 

- The study reports health risks related to the type of sugar consumed, but also reveals novel risks when sugars are combined, which has important implications for dietary guidelines.When it comes to health risks, sugar in the form of fructose is clearly the bad guy. 

- When there is too much fructose, the liver produces uric acid and fat in the form of triglycerides, which increase the risk of fatty liver, heart disease and gout. 

- "It turns out that the combination of fructose and glucose found in high fructose corn syrup appears to be worse than fructose alone for some heart disease risk factors," said Stanhope. 

- "Research has shown that fructose compared with glucose increases risk factors for heart disease and diabetes. 

- The new study, published in Metabolism Journal, tested this assumption by examining differences in health risk factors based on sugar type. 

- Participants consumed beverages containing fructose, glucose, high fructose corn syrup, or an aspartame control, and researchers analyzed their blood for known risk factors for heart disease and diabetes.The researchers expected risk factors would be highest for fructose and lowest for glucose, with high fructose corn syrup somewhere in between. 

- However, for others, including the risk factors many scientists believe are the most predictive for heart disease, the increases were highest for high fructose corn syrup due to an interaction of fructose and glucose.CONSUMER CHOICES AND DIETARY GUIDELINESThe results of the current study suggest that dietary guidelines and consumer choices should not be based on the assumption that all adverse effects from dietary sugars are due to fructose content. 

- "Our study shows that nutrition is more than looking at individual food components," said first author Bettina Hieronimus with the Department of Child Nutrition at the Max-Rubner Institut in Karlsruhe, Germany. 

- "Intermittent Fasting Diet Improves Health Without Altering The Body’s Core ClockUniversity of Copenhagen, Australian Catholic University and Karolinska Institutet, September 17, 2020When it comes to metabolic health, it’s not just what you eat, it’s when you eat it. 

- Time-restricted feeding – otherwise known as intermittent fasting – has also been shown to improve health even before weight loss kicks in.The biological explanation for the phenomenon remains poorly understood. 

- By focusing on the short-term and early effects of time-restricted feeding, the goal was to disentangle the signals that govern health from those associated with weight loss.“We observe that the rhythm of skeletal muscle core clock genes is unchanged by time-restricted feeding, suggesting that any differences are driven more by diet, rather than inherent rhythms,” says Postdoc Leonidas Lundell, from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR) at the University of Copenhagen.“We also see that the metabolite profile of skeletal muscle switches from being predominantly lipid based, to amino acid based, after time-restricted feeding. 

- This coincides with changes in rhythmicity of amino acid transporters, indicating that part of the amino acid profile could be due to absorption from the blood.”Research Fellow Evelyn Parr from the Mary MacKillop Institute for Health Research at the Australian Catholic University, adds: “Our research is an important step towards understanding how time-restricted eating can improve metabolic health, while bridging the gap between animal models and human intervention studies. 

- This suggests that the altered rhythmicity of metabolite and gene expression caused by time-restricted feeding could be responsible for the positive health impact.“Our findings open new avenues for scientists who are interested in understanding the causal relationship between time-restricted feeding and improved metabolic health. 

- These insights could help develop new therapies to improve the lives of people who live with obesity,” says Professor Juleen Zierath from Karolinska Institutet and CBMR at the University of Copenhagen.Green soy extract could prevent cognitive dysfunction: Mouse dataUniversity of Shizuoka (Japan), September 16, 2020Intake of green soybean extract could help reverse cognitive dysfunction and its associated accumulation of beta-amyloid proteins in the brain, say researchers.The accumulation of beta-amyloid proteins has long been linked to the development of brain stunting conditions including Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia.The new findings come from a Japanese trial in mice with cognitive dysfunction.Writing in the Journal of Functional Foods, the team revealed that brain functions were ‘significantly better-preserved’ in aged mice fed green soybean than age-matched control mice with or without yellow soybean feeding.The molecular mechanisms of these beneficial effects on brain function were examined using transcriptome analysis. 

- An increased expression of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (Ptgds) and a significant reduction in the amyloid precursor protein Aplp1 was reported by the team, led by Keiko Unno from the University of Shizuoka in Japan.“As Ptgds binds and transports small lipophilic molecules (…) it has been proposed as the endogenous Aβ chaperone,” noted the team, adding that lower levels of the usually abundant protein “may play an important role in the development of dementia and of Alzheimer's disease (AD).”“Furthermore, the amount of beta-amyloid 40 and 42 was reduced in the insoluble fraction of cerebral cortex,” the team noted.Unno and colleagues noted that previous research has suggested several beneficial effects of soybean components such as so isoflavones, including previous suggestions of benefits for cognitive function and the prevention of oxidative damage.In the current study, the isoflavones found to be present in soybean extracts were mostly the glycosides genstin and daidzin.“The levels of genistein and daizein, aglycones of genstin and daidzin, respectively, were very low or not detected,” reported the team – adding that the content of oligo sugars, especially sucrose, was significantly higher in green soybean than in yellow. 

- The study is being published today by JAMA Oncology.The investigators found that in 1,171 patients treated for metastatic colorectal cancer, those who reported drinking two to three cups of coffee a day were likely to live longer overall, and had a longer time before their disease worsened, than those who didn't drink coffee. 

- "Epidemiological studies have found that higher coffee intake was associated with improved survival in patients with stage 3 colon cancer, but the relationship between coffee consumption and survival in patients with metastatic forms of the disease hasn't been known. 

- Researchers correlated this data with information on the course of the cancer after treatment.They found that participants who drank two to three cups of coffee per day had a reduced hazard for death and for cancer progression compared to those who didn't drink coffee. 

- "Although it is premature to recommend a high intake of coffee as a potential treatment for colorectal cancer, our study suggests that drinking coffee is not harmful and may potentially be beneficial," says Dana-Farber's Kimmie Ng, MD, MPH, senior author of the study. 

- "This study adds to the large body of literature supporting the importance of diet and other modifiable factors in the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer," Ng adds. 

- "Research links increased omega-3 intake to improved cardiovascular outcomesOchsner Medical Center in New Orleans, Sept. 17, 2020A new study, the most comprehensive analysis of the role of omega-3 dosage on cardiovascular prevention to date, provides compelling evidence for consuming more EPA and DHA (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, respectively) omega-3 fats. 

- According to the research, EPA and DHA omega-3 intake is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events, the cause of 7.4 million deaths globally each year, and reduced risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack), including fatal heart attack.Specifically, the study found that EPA+DHA supplementation is associated with a statistically significant reduced risk of:myocardial infarction (13%)fatal myocardial infarction (35%)CHD events (10%)CHD mortality (9%)"The study supports the notion that EPA and DHA intake contributes to cardioprotection, and that whatever you're getting through the diet, you likely need more," said Carl "Chip" Lavie, MD, a cardiologist at Ochsner Health in New Orleans and one of the study authors.Cardiovascular benefits appear to increase with dosage. 

- The researchers found that adding an extra 1000 mg of EPA and DHA per day decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease and heart attack even more: risk of cardiovascular disease events decreased by 5.8% and risk for heart attack decreased by 9.0%. 

- The study looked at dosages of up to 5500 mg/day.This research corroborates the results of an earlier meta-analysis from Harvard School of Public Health, published in October 2019, that looked at EPA and DHA dosage using the 13 largest clinical studies. 

- "Taking omega-3 supplements is a relatively low-cost, high-impact way to improve heart health with few associated risks." 

- Findings from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial are published in Annals of Internal Medicine.Despite its large disease burden, no approved disease-modifying drugs currently are available to treat osteoarthritis. 

- Due to the modest effect of the turmeric extracts on knee pain, small sample size of the study, short-duration of follow-up and the single research center, the researchers suggest that multicenter trials with larger sample sizes and long duration of follow-up are needed to assess the clinical significance of their findings.Pine bark supplements fight the harmful effects of oxidative stress after exercise: ResearchUniversity of Louisiana, September 15, 2020Researchers from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette said that taking pine bark supplements led to lower levels of malonaldehyde (MDA), a toxic compound that serves as a biomarker for oxidative stress. 

- This effect was seen 48 hours after exercise among individuals who took the supplements for at least two weeks.The researchers noted that high physical activity often spurs higher levels of oxidative stress. 

- But by taking pine bark supplements, individuals can benefit from an enhanced healing process.“[Maritime] pine extract as compared to placebo was effective at affording protection from oxidative stress post-exercise,” wrote the researchers.Pine bark extract protects against oxidative stressPine bark extract is an herbal extract that comes from the tree Pinus pinaster, or maritime pine. 

- Previous research also linked pine bark extract to a host of health benefits such as boosting brain function, balancing blood sugar levels and improving blood flow.In the study, the researchers looked at the effects of pine bark supplements on 20 healthy men. 

- They were randomly assigned to either 200 mg of the extract or a placebo and took these for 14 days prior to the first exercise trial and for 2?days post-exercise. 

- The placebo group also displayed significant increases in MDA levels before and 48 hours after the exercise.Given these findings, the researchers recommended further research to evaluate the effects of pine bark extract among individuals who practice intense training. 

- Furthermore, they see great potential in pine bark extract for helping treat metabolic syndrome, a group of diseases that are influenced by oxidative stress.Researchers use soy to improve bone cancer treatmentWashington State University, September 15, 2020Researchers in recent years have demonstrated the health benefits of soy, linking its consumption to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, cancer and improved bone health.Now, WSU researchers are hoping to use the health benefits of the popular legume to improve post-operative treatment of bone cancer.Reporting in the journal, Acta Biomaterialia, graduate student Naboneeta Sarkar and Professor Susmita Bose in WSU's School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering showed that the slow release of soy-based chemical compounds from a 3D-printed bone-like scaffold resulted in a reduction in bone cancer cells while building up healthy cells and reducing harmful inflammation. 

- "Using these natural medicines, one can make a difference to human health with very minimal or no side effects, although a critical issue remains composition control. 

- Despite medical advances, patients with osteosarcoma and metastatic bone cancer experience a high rate of recurrence, and osteosarcoma is second leading cause of cancer death in children.Treatment involves surgery to remove the tumor as well as pre- and post-operative chemotherapy. 

- High doses of chemotherapy before and after surgery can also have harmful side effects.Researchers would like to develop gentler treatment options, especially after surgery when patients are trying to recover from bone damage at the same time that they are taking harsh drugs to suppress tumor growth. 

- Isoflavones have also been shown to improve bone health and possibly prevent osteoporosis.One of the soybean compounds caused a 90% reduction in bone cancer cell viability in their samples after 11 days. 

- Furthermore, using the soy compounds in animal models also reduced inflammation, which could benefit bone health as well as overall recovery. 

- More detailed long-term studies are needed, using animal research as well as other malignant cells, she said.Broccoli extract found to significantly improve autism symptoms; sulforaphane molecule is powerful natural medicineMass General Hospital for Children, September 14, 2020A powerful anti-cancer nutrient found naturally in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower could help significantly improve health outcomes in autistic men and boys. 

- Research published in the journal The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that sulforaphane, an antioxidant compound, is capable of reversing many of the most common symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claims that there are no medications currently on the market that can treat or cure ASD, a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind pilot study suggests otherwise. 

- Present most richly in broccoli sprouts, sulforaphane has been shown to help drastically improve social interactions and verbal communication in ASD-diagnosed men and boys as well as reduce hyperactivity, irritability and other ASD symptoms.Conducted on 44 males aged 13 to 27, the study found that after 18 weeks of consuming sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout extract, more than half of the men saw significant health improvements. 

- Behavioral abnormalities also decreased significantly as a result of the treatment, as did lipid peroxidation and neuroinflammation. 

- "Sulforaphane, which showed negligible toxicity, was selected because it upregulates genes that protect aerobic cells against oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA-damage, all of which are prominent and possibly mechanistic characteristics of ASD," the authors wrote.Sulforaphane in broccoli sprouts regulates cellular health, energy production and detoxificationDepending on their individual weights, the men and boys were assigned to take either 232 mg (for those who weighed 100 pounds or less), 464 mg (101 to 199 pounds), or 696 mg (more than 200 pounds) of sulforaphane-rich broccoli extract daily. 

- The stress proteome is responsible for regulating processes such as glutathione synthesis, mitochondrial function (cellular health), and neurological inflammation.When ASD patients stopped taking sulforaphane, their symptoms returnedIn order for sulforaphane to work, however, ASD patients need to continue taking it. 

- "The improvements seen on the Social Responsiveness Scale were particularly remarkable, and I've been told this is the first time that any statistically significant improvement on the SRS has been seen for a drug study in autism spectrum disorder," he added, noting that the consensus among the research team was that sulforaphane likely activates the Nrf2 pathway, reducing inflammation in the brain and promoting increased antioxidant protection.Exercise's Surprising Potential To Treat People With Multiple Chronic ConditionsUniversity of Southern Denmark, September 11, 2020Hundreds of millions of people of all ages worldwide live with two or more chronic conditions – commonly defined as multimorbidity. 

- Those living with it are found to have poorer physical and mental health, higher risk of being admitted to hospital, and higher risk of dying prematurely compared to people with only one chronic condition.Given that the number of people living with multimorbidity is only expected to rise in the future, finding better treatments is considered the next major health priority. 

- Few studies have investigated treatment options – and unfortunately the results of these studies most often offer negligible improvements.People with multimorbidity want treatments that will improve their physical, mental, emotional, and social health. 

- Our research found that exercise may actually be a surprising treatment for those living with multimorbidity, and offer many of these improvements patients want.Currently, multimorbidity is managed by treating each chronic conditions separately using available medicines. 

- However, this might not reduce symptoms sufficiently, and can have many adverse health effects. 

- Many people consult several health care providers and also end up taking multiple drugs (often at least one for each condition) which carries a risk of adverse events and can be inconvenient and unsatisfactory for patients.Exercise as medicineResearch has shown exercise is an effective treatment for 26 chronic conditions, including osteoarthritis, depression and type 2 diabetes. 

- Research also shows exercise could potentially prevent 35 chronic conditions from developing.Thanks to its overall effects on health (such as lowering blood pressure, improving joint health and cognitive function, exercise therapy can benefit a range of chronic conditions. 

- At the same time, exercise requires physical effort, and like pharmacological treatments, the effects will diminish if you stop exercising.But could exercise therapy benefit people with multiple chronic conditions as well? 

- This is what our recent review aimed to investigate.We assessed the effect of exercise therapy on the physical and mental health of people with at least two of the following chronic conditions: osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, depression, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 

- We found 23 studies that looked at adults aged 50 to 80 years old.The exercise therapy interventions used in the studies were at least partially supervised by a physiotherapist or an exercise physiologist. 

- Most lasted 12 weeks on average and exercise was performed two to three times a week, starting from low intensity and progressing to moderate to high intensity. 

- The exercise therapies included were aquatic exercise, strength training, aerobic training and tai chi.Our review showed exercise therapy improved quality of life and reduced anxiety and depression symptoms. 

- The benefits were higher in younger patients and patients who had higher depression symptoms before starting exercise therapy. 

- This highlights that people with severe depression – often considered ineligible for exercise due to their depression severity – may benefit highly from exercise therapy.Patients who participated in exercise therapy were also able to walk longer. 

- Those taking part walked on average 43 metres more than those not taking part in the exercise interventions, over six minutes. 

- This improvement appears to be important for the patient and it reduced their disability.Exercise therapy also didn’t increase risk of non-serious side effects, such as knee, arm, or back pain, or falls and fatigue. 

- What’s more, it reduced the risk of hospitalisation, pneumonia, and extreme fatigue.As such, exercise could be a safe and effective therapy instead of increasing drug prescription in people with multiple chronic conditions. 

- However these findings need to be confirmed in future trials to have a more definitive answer.Together with patients and healthcare professionals, we are developing and testing an exercise therapy and self-management programme in the MOBILIZE project. 

- This trial will help us understand whether personalised exercise therapy and self-management is effective in managing and treating multimorbidity.In the meantime, people with multimorbidity can improve mental and physical health by exercising two to three times a week. 

- Aerobic workouts, strength training or a combination of the two can promote similar health benefits, regardless of the conditions a person live with. 

- However, it’s important that the exercise therapy sessions are supervised and that the intensity of the session progresses based on patient capabilities.Plant-based diets found to relieve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritisGeorge Washington University, September 14, 2020In a major breakthrough, a team of researchers from the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the non-profit health organization Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) looked at recent studies that assessed the impact of diet on the risk of rheumatoid arthritis.The group found that certain foods, such as red meat, milk and milk products, could exacerbate the condition. 

- In contrast, diets rich in plant-based foods like fruits, grains and legumes help reduce pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis patients.In all, these findings suggest that a simple menu change could help patients better manage their disease, said co-author and PCRM clinical research director Hana Kahleova. 

- Sticking to a plant-based diet could also keep the disease in remission for long periods. 

- Their findings appeared online in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition.Plant-based diets can benefit rheumatoid arthritis patientsNumerous studies indicate that plant-based diets could help decrease the risk of chronic autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. 

- In patients, adopting a plant-based diet could help in better management of the disease for the long-term.There are a number of possible mechanisms behind these beneficial effects. 

- Copious amounts of these fats can be found in plant-based foods like nuts and avocados.In addition, the researchers found that the state of one’s gut health, which depends on diet and nutrition, could also influence the onset and progression of rheumatoid arthritis. 

- For instance, a permeable intestinal barrier, a marker of poor gut health, allows for bacteria and other microbes to enter the bloodstream.These harmful agents could then trigger inflammation and joint pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients. 

- Research shows that a plant-based diet modulates the gut microbiome for better gut health. 

- Enzymes and amino acids in plant-based foods also increase bacterial diversity in the gut, which rheumatoid arthritis patients often lack.Taken together, these studies provide empirical evidence that a plant-based diet comprised of fruits, vegetables, grains and legumes could be incredibly beneficial for people with rheumatoid arthritis.Researchers Report Recent Findings that Garlic Improves Visual Memory and AttentionUniversity of Dhaka (Bangladesh), September 14, 2020Researchers from University of Dhaka Report Recent Findings in Complementary and Alternative Medicine that  "Studies have shown that Allium sativum L.  or garlic protects amyloid-beta peptide-induced apoptosis, prevents oxidative insults to neurons and synapses, and thus prevent Alzheimer's disease progression in experimental animals. 

- In light of the increasing link between gut microbiota and human wellness, this new association is worth exploring and further vouches for this fruit's superfood and super healer statusThe old saying that eating an apple a day will keep the doctor away may have some scientific basis after all, as scientific literature is packed with findings that vouch for this fruit's healthful benefits.Showing that the saying above goes beyond folk medicine fantasy, a study found that eating one apple a day for four weeks translated to lower blood levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein//beta2-glycoprotein I complex, which may contribute to atherosclerosis, by 40% among healthy, middle-aged individuals. 

- All it takes: two apples a day.Study FindingsApples are a frequently consumed fruit and a reliable source of polyphenols and fiber, an important mediator for their health-protective effects. 

- [vi]Gut Health Affects Your Whole BodyThe link between the gut microbiota and human wellness is being increasingly recognized, where it is now well-established that healthy gut flora is a key part of your overall health. 

- [ix]Additional Apple BenefitsMore benefits of apple intake are coming out of the medical literature, confirming its superfood and super healer status that shouldn't be missed out on.These benefits include addressing common issues such as aging (reduced rate), allergies, alopecia or hair loss, diarrhea, insulin resistance, radiation-induced illness, and Staphylococcal infection. 

- In the area of cancer treatment, apples have been found to both prevent and suppress mammary cancers in the animal model, while carotenoids extracted from the fruit have been found to inhibit drug-resistant cancer cell line proliferation.

LIVE Webinar With Dr. Gary Null: Positive Solutions for Today's ProblemsHealthy diet and exercise during pregnancy could lead to healthier children, study findsKings College London, September 13, 2020New research shows improving the lifestyle of women with obesity during pregnancy could mean long-term cardiovascular benefits for their children.The study, led by King's College London and supported by the British Heart Foundation and Tommy's charity, examined how an antenatal diet and physical activity intervention in pregnant women with obesity could positively influence the health of the women and their children three years after giving birth.The UPBEAT trial is a randomised controlled trial which aims to improve the diet and physical activity of obese pregnant women across the UK. 

- Women who were given a diet and exercise intervention were compared to women in a control group, who made no changes to their lifestyle during pregnancy.Follow-up examinations three years after birth showed that the children born to the intervention arm of the trial had a lower resting heart rate of -5 bpm than children treated with standard care. 

- These findings are very exciting as they add to the evidence that pregnancy is a window of opportunity to promote positive health and lifestyle changes which benefit the mother and her child. 

- "Senior author Professor Lucilla Poston, Tommy's Chair for Maternal and Fetal Health, said: "Obesity in pregnancy is a major problem because it can increase the risk of complications in pregnancy as well as affecting the longer-term health of the child. 

- It's very reassuring to see that our researchers have been able to improve mothers' diets and children's heart health in the long term, helping to give these babies the best start in life. 

- A healthy diet before, during and after pregnancy can have positive long-term health benefits for both mother and child. 

- "The team of researchers will follow-up these children again at 8-10 years of age to see if this improvement in cardiovascular function is maintained through childhood.Ashwagandha May Calm Generalized Anxiety DisorderNew findings from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trialMashhad University of Medical Sciences (Iran), September 1, 2020Study Objective:To assess the effect of an extract of Withania somnifera on symptoms of generalized anxietyDesign:  Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trialParticipantsForty patients who were undergoing treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) participated in this trial. 

- They were randomly selected for the treatment group (W somnifera root extract, 1 g/day; n=22) or the placebo group (n=18). 

- The HAM-A scale contains 14 questions rating the severity of common GAD symptoms, from 0 to 4.Primary Outcome MeasuresHAM-A scores during the course of the trial revealed a significant amelioration of GAD symptoms in the treatment group versus placebo (P
Probiotic skin therapy improves eczema in children, study suggestsNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, September 10, 2020An experimental treatment for eczema that aims to modify the skin microbiome safely reduced disease severity and increased quality of life for children as young as 3 years of age, a National Institutes of Health study has found. 

- These improvements persisted for up to eight months after treatment stopped, researchers report Sept. 9 in Science Translational Medicine.Atopic dermatitis, commonly called eczema, is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by dry, itchy skin and rashes. 

- The disease is most common in children and is linked to an increased risk of developing asthma, hay fever and food allergy. 

- "These early-stage findings suggest that R. mucosatherapy may help relieve some children of both the burden of eczema symptoms and the need for daily treatment. 

- Interim results reported in 2018 for 10 adults and five children aged 9 to 14 years indicated that the treatment was safe and associated with reduced eczema severity. 

- The last five children to enroll received the same dose throughout the four-month treatment period. 

- "These results support a larger study to further assess the safety and effectiveness of this experimental treatment by comparing it with a placebo. 

- "Seventeen of the 20 children experienced a greater than 50% improvement in eczema severity following treatment. 

- These benefits persisted after treatment ended, and the therapeutic R. mucosa strains remained on the skin for up to eight months.The NIAID researchers next set out to better understand how R. mucosa therapy improves eczema symptoms. 

- Study participants had increased levels of these lipids on their skinafter treatment with R. mucosa.The researchers emphasize that additional studies are needed to further elucidate the mechanism of R. mucosa therapy and to explore whether genetic or other factors may explain why some participants did not benefit from the experimental treatment.Gestational diabetes may accelerate child's biological ageLong-term health risks include cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and higher weight, Rutgers study saysRutgers University, September 10, 2020Children born to mothers who had diabetes during pregnancy may age faster biologically and be at an increased risk for obesity and high blood pressure, according to Rutgers researchers.The study, published in the journal Epigenetics, explored how more than 1,000 children born to mothers in China aged on a cellular level. 

- Researchers examined their exposure to gestational diabetes in utero and their DNA methylation, or epigenetic age, which indicates how experiences and exposures reflect true biological age even in early childhood.Accelerated aging, which can be determined by evaluating if a person's estimated DNA methylation age is greater than their chronological age, has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular risks and poor health outcomes later in life.The researchers measured the epigenetic age of 1,156 children who were ages 3 to 10 in Tianjin, China, to see how it differed from their chronological age. 

- "These findings suggest that gestational diabetes may have long-term effects on epigenetic aging in offspring and lead to poorer cardiometabolic health outcomes," said lead author Stephanie Shiau, an instructor at the Rutgers School of Public Health.The findings support the need for further studies using longitudinal samples to evaluate the association between epigenetic age and later onset of adult metabolic diseases.In the United States, between 2 percent to 10 percent of pregnancies are affected by the condition annually, according to the National Institutes of Health.Ten minutes of massage or rest will help your body fight stress: studyUniversity of Konstanz (Germany) September 13, 2020Allowing yourself a few minutes of downtime significantly boosts mental and physical relaxation. 

- The findings, reported on 8 September 2020 in the journal Scientific Reports, provide the first indication that short-term treatments can robustly reduce stress on a psychological and physiological level by boosting the body's principal engine for relaxation—the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS).Stress is known to have negative consequences for health and disease. 

- Launching a relaxation response is thus key to protecting our health and restoring balance in our body. 

- Massage has been used to improve relaxation, yet no systematic approach exists to robustly confirm its effect on the PNS and whether or not this could be used as rehabilitation for patients suffering from stress-related disease.Boosting the body's engine for relaxationThis study indicates that massage is an easy-to-apply intervention that can boost the body's principal engine for relaxation—the PNS—and also lead to a reduction in perceived mental stress. 

- "You don't need a professional treatment in order to relax. 

- "Processed food linked to age-marker in chromosomesUniversity of Navarra (Spain), September 10, 2020People who eat a lot of industrially processed junk food are more likely to exhibit a change in their chromosomes linked to aging, according to research presented at an online medical conference.Three or more servings of so-called “ultra-processed food” per day doubled the odds that strands of DNA and proteins called telomeres, found on the end of chromosomes, would be shorter compared to people who rarely consumed such foods, scientists reported at the European and International Conference on Obesity.Short telomeres are a marker of biological aging at the cellular level, and the study suggests that diet is a factor in driving the cells to age faster.While the correlation is strong, however, the causal relationship between eating highly processed foods and diminished telomeres remains speculative, the authors cautioned.Each human cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain our genetic code.Telomeres do not carry genetic information, but are vital for preserving the stability and integrity of chromosomes and, by extension, the DNA that all the cells in our body relies on to function.As we get older, our telomeres shorten naturally because each time a cell divides, part of the telomere is lost.That reduction in length has long been recognized as a marker of biological age.Scientists led by professors Maria Bes-Rastrollo and Amelia Marti, both of the University of Navarra in Spain, wanted to explore a suspected connection between the regular consumption of highly processed junk food and shrinking telomeres.Earlier studies had pointed to a possible link with sugar-sweetened drinks, processed meats and other foods loaded with saturated fats and sugar, but the findings were inconclusive.Ultra-processed foods are industrially manufactured substances composed of some mix of oils, fats, sugars, starch and proteins that contain little if any whole or natural foods.They often include artificial flavorings, colorings, emulsifiers, preservatives and other additives that increase shelf-life and profit margins.These same properties, however, also mean that such foods are nutritionally poor compared to less processed alternatives, the researchers said.Earlier studies have shown strong correlations between ultra-processed foods and hypertension, obesity, depression, type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer.These conditions are often age-related in so far as they are linked to oxidative stress and inflammation known to influence telomere length.Marti and colleagues looked at health data for nearly 900 people aged 55 or older who provided DNA samples in 2008 and provided detailed data about their eating habits every two years thereafter.The 645 men and 241 women were equally divided into four groups, depending on their consumption of ultra-processed foods.Those in the high-intake group were more likely to have a family history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and abnormal blood fats.That also consumed less foods associated with the Mediterranean diet — fibre, olive oil, fruits, vegetable and nuts.Compared to the group who ate the fewest ultra-processed foods, the other three showed an increased likelihood — 29, 40 and 82 percent, respectively — of having shortened telomeres.The findings were published earlier this year in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Mother's iodine status related to child's IQBothwell OB/GYN Associates, September 9, 2020For a woman planning to have a baby, there are many health factors to take into consideration. 

- "However, women who are pregnant or planning to be can make simple changes to increase their iodine intake including watching what they eat, taking prenatal vitamins and using iodized salt in place of regular salt. 

- "The World Health Organization recommends pregnant women should take 250 micrograms of iodine a day during pregnancy and lactation. 

- "For that reason, Nolla recommends women start taking prenatal vitamins three months before attempting to conceive. 

- However, even if there are no obvious signs of deficiency, iodine levels should be monitored to ensure the health of the mother and child, Nolla said. 

- "A mother's iodine level has a significant impact on a baby's health," she said. 

- Previous studies on CBD have focused on its medicinal uses for pain relief, epileptic seizures, insomnia and Parkinson’s disease.But a recent study from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) found that CBD could also benefit children and adults suffering from Angelman syndrome (AS).First author Bin Gu and his colleagues tested the effects of CBD on seizures, motor deficits and brain abnormalities in a mouse model of the said neurogenetic disorder.Their experiments demonstrated that CBD treatment can reduce the severity of seizures in mice with AS. 

- In addition, CBD also caused mild sedation and restored the mice’s normal brain rhythms.Gu is hopeful that their findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, could inspire further research into the use of CBD as a treatment for seizures caused by AS and other neurological disorders.CBD reduces seizures and causes mild sedationAS is a rare neurogenetic disorder that occurs in one in 15,000 live births, or about 500,000 people around the globe. 

- In response to this need, he and his colleagues created genetically modified mouse models of AS that they could use to find a possible treatment.The researchers chose to test CBD because of its anti-epileptic properties. 

- In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of CBD as a treatment for seizures caused by two rare forms of epilepsy. 

- Its drug-resistant nature has further complicated the development of treatments and therapies for it.The UW researchers assessed the effects of CBD treatment on a mouse model of DS. 

- However, this effect was lost at the higher doses needed to reduce seizures.Nephi Stella, the founder of the UW Center for Cannabis Research and a member of the research team, said that their findings highlight the need for a treatment that could confer both benefits at once.Nevertheless, the researchers noted that their findings contribute to the emerging data supporting the use of CBD in the treatment of drug-resistant and debilitating neurological conditions.A Novel Approach to Treating COVID-19 Using Nutritional and Oxidative TherapiesDavid Brownstein, M.D. 

- (journal, Science, Public Health Policy and the LawObjective: This report is a case series of consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated with a nutritional and oxidative medical approach. 

- We describe the treatment program and report the response of the 107 COVID-19 patients.Study Design: Observational case series consecutive.Setting: A family practice office in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan.Patients: All patients seen in the office from February through May 2020 diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. 

- COVID-19 was either diagnosed via PCR or antibodytesting as well as those not tested diagnosed via symptomology.Interventions: Oral Vitamins A, C, D, and iodine were given to 107 subjects (99%). 

- Symptomatic improvement after treatment was reported for each patient consisting of first improvement, mostly better, and completely better.Results: There were a total of 107 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. 

- Three were hospitalized (3%) with two of the three hospitalized before instituting treatment and only one requiring hospitalization after beginning treatment. 

- The time to improvement in the SARS-CoV-2 test positive group was slightly longer than the entire cohort.Conclusion: At present, there is no published cure, treatment, or preventive for COVID-19 except for a recent report on dexamethasone for seriously ill patients. 

- A novel treatment program combining nutritional and oxidative therapies was shown to successfully treat the signs and symptoms of 100% of 107 patients diagnosed with COVID-19.Each patient was treated with an individualized plan consisting of a combination of oral, IV, IM, and nebulized nutritional and oxidative therapies which resulted in zero deaths and recovery from COVID-19.Milk thistle protects against COPD caused by secondhand smokeSichuan University, (China), September 11, 2020According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 15.7 million people suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – a serious respiratory condition which can cause scarring of the lungs, narrowing of the airway and extreme difficulty breathing. 

- Other constituents include the toxic heavy metals arsenic, lead and cadmium.Although lung cancer is probably the disease most often associated with secondhand smoke, this lethal form of air pollution is also a primary factor in COPD – which is currently the third leading cause of death in the United States.Having COPD raises the risk of developing lung cancer and heart disease. 

- )Silymarin, a flavonoid in milk thistle, alleviates inflammatory responseIn a study published in the journal Inflammation, researchers exposed mice to the equivalent of 1.5 packs of cigarettes a day for four weeks, creating drastic increases in peribronchial inflammation, thickening of airway walls and airway obstruction.The team found that pretreating the mice with silymarin – the active component of milk thistle – an hour before exposure dramatically decreased inflammatory changes, and cut production of pro-inflammatory chemicals such as TNF-alpha and interleukin.Encouragingly, silymarin also helped safeguard levels of superoxide dismutase, an important disease-fighting antioxidant produced in the body.A year later, the same team of researchers took another, closer look at the workings of milk thistle. 

- As always, you should consult a trusted healthcare provider before supplementing with milk thistle – especially if you have a serious medical condition.For maximum benefit, some natural health experts advise taking a silymarin-phosphatidylcholine complex, a formulation which helps beneficial silymarin attach to cell membranes more easily.Note: Milk thistle is a member of the aster family. 

- Don’t take milk thistle if you are allergic to any of its “cousins,” such as ragweed, chrysanthemum, chamomile, marigolds, yarrow or daisies.Notwithstanding its unglamorous resume as a common weed that thrives in fields and pastures, the humble milk thistle is actually a potent herbal hero that can help defend against a debilitating and deadly disease. 

- If you have been – or are currently – exposed to firsthand or secondhand cigarette smoke, supplementing with milk thistle to protect against COPD could be a wise move.ReplyReply allForward

- After analysis of numerous papers, we found that polyphenols aiding endothelial function is beneficial not only for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or endothelial dysfunction but for all people as it can improve the effects of aging on the endothelia. 

- The additional benefit of these polyphenols on weight loss further improves health and lowers the risk of several diseases, including those caused by endothelial dysfunction.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “However, it is important to note that the dosages in the majorities of the studies mentioned in this review were of supplemental rather than nutritionally relevant quantities, and therefore, the recommended dosages are difficult to determine.”How screen time and green time may affect youth psychological outcomesUniversity of Adelaide (Australia), September 4, 2020Less screen time and more green time are associated with better psychological outcomes among children and adolescents, according to a study published September 2 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Tassia Oswald of the University of Adelaide, and colleagues.The prevalence of mental illness among children and adolescents is increasing globally. 

- This combination of high screen time and low green time may affect mental health and well-being. 

- But research investigating the psychological impacts of screen time or green time typically considers each factor in isolation and fails to delineate the reciprocal effects of high technology use and low contact with nature on mental health and cognitive outcomes. 

- To address this question, Oswald and colleagues analyzed the findings of 186 studies to collate evidence assessing associations between screen time, green time, and psychological outcomes (including mental health, cognitive functioning, and academic achievement) for children and adolescents.In general, high levels of screen time appeared to be associated with unfavorable psychological outcomes, while green time appeared to be associated with favorable psychological outcomes. 

- According to the authors, preliminary evidence suggests that green time could potentially buffer the consequences of high screen time, meaning nature may be an under-utilized public health resource to promote youth psychological well-being in a high-tech era. 

- Investment in more rigorous research is needed to explore this.Oswald adds: "This systematic scoping review highlights that nature may currently be an under-utilised public health resource, which could potentially function as an upstream preventative and psychological well-being promotion intervention for children and adolescents in a high-tech era. 

- Gintonin-enriched fraction (GEF) exhibits anti-brain senescence and effects against disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). 

- This review describes the characteristics of gintonin and GEF, and how gintonin exerts its effects on brain aging and brain associated-neurodegenerative diseases.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Finally, we describe how GEF can be applied to improve the quality of life of senior citizens in aging societies.”How we sleep today may forecast when Alzheimer's disease beginsDon't despair. 

- deep, restorative sleep may defend against this virulent form of dementiaUniversity of California Berkeley, September 6, 2020What would you do if you knew how long you had until Alzheimer's disease set in? 

- New research from the University of California, Berkeley, suggests one defense against this virulent form of dementia -- for which no treatment currently exists -- is deep, restorative sleep, and plenty of it.UC Berkeley neuroscientists Matthew Walker and Joseph Winer have found a way to estimate, with some degree of accuracy, a time frame for when Alzheimer's is most likely to strike in a person's lifetime. 

- In doing so, we can measure how quickly this toxic protein accumulates in the brain over time, which can indicate the beginning of Alzheimer's disease," said Winer, the study's lead author and a Ph.D. student in Walker's Center for Human Sleep Science at UC Berkeley.In addition to predicting the time it is likely to take for the onset of Alzheimer's, the results reinforce the link between poor sleep and the disease, which is particularly critical in the face of a tsunami of aging baby boomers on the horizon.While previous studies have found that sleep cleanses the brain of beta-amyloid deposits, these new findings identify deep non-REM slow-wave sleep as the target of intervention against cognitive decline.And though genetic testing can predict one's inherent susceptibility to Alzheimer's, and blood tests offer a diagnostic tool, neither offers the potential for a lifestyle therapeutic intervention that sleep does, the researchers point out. 

- "If deep, restorative sleep can slow down this disease, we should be making it a major priority," Winer said. 

- "The 32 healthy participants in their 60s, 70s and 80s who are enrolled in the sleep study are part of the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study headed by UC Berkeley public health professor William Jagust, also a co-author on this latest study. 

- The study of healthy aging was launched in 2005 with a grant from the National Institutes of Health.For the experiment, each participant spent an eight-hour night of sleep in Walker's lab while undergoing polysomnography, a battery of tests that record brain waves, heart rate, blood-oxygen levels and other physiological measures of sleep quality.Over the course of the multi-year study, the researchers periodically tracked the growth rate of the beta-amyloid protein in the participants' brains using positron emission tomography, or PET scans, and compared the individuals' beta-amyloid levels to their sleep profiles.Researchers focused on the brain activity present during deep slow-wave sleep. 

- They also assessed the study participants' sleep efficiency, which is defined as actual time spent asleep, as opposed to lying sleepless in bed.The results supported their hypothesis that sleep quality is a biomarker and predictor of disease down the road. 

- "We know there's a connection between people's sleep quality and what's going on in the brain, in terms of Alzheimer's disease. 

- "Indeed, if we can bend the arrow of Alzheimer's risk downward by improving sleep, it would be a significant and hopeful advance," Walker concluded.Link between positive emotions and health depends on cultureUniversity of Wisconsin, September 8, 2020Positive emotions are often seen as critical aspects of healthy living, but new researchsuggests that the link between emotion and health outcomes may vary by cultural context. 

- The findings, published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, show that experiencing positive emotions is linked with better cardiovascular health in the US but not in Japan. 

- ""Our findings underscore the importance of cultural context for understanding links between emotion and health, something that has been largely ignored in the literature," Yoo adds. 

- "Although some studies have examined cultural differences in links between positive emotions and healthy functioning, this work is novel in that it includes biological measures of health and large representative samples from both countries. 

- "The fact that positive emotions are conceived of and valued differently across cultures led Yoo and colleagues to wonder whether the health benefits observed in tandem with positive emotions might be specific to Western populations. 

- Data included participants' ratings of how frequently they felt 10 different positive emotions in the previous 30 days and measures of blood lipids, which provided objective data on participants' heart health. 

- "Because of the global prevalence of coronary artery disease, blood lipids are considered important indices of biological health in many Western and East Asian countries," Yoo explains.As expected, the data indicated that experiencing frequent positive emotions was associated with healthy lipid profiles for American participants. 

- "By demonstrating that the cultural variation in the connection between emotional well-being and physical well-being, our research has wide-ranging relevance among those who seek to promote well-being in the communities and the workplace, including clinicians, executives, and policy makers," Yoo concludes.In future work, the researchers will examine longitudinal data to determine whether the evidence suggests a direct causal link between emotions and health. 

- They also hope to identify emotional profiles that may be more relevant or important to health outcomes in East Asian cultures.Experimental research suggests co-administration of Panax ginseng and Brassica oleracea plants (kale, broccoli, cabbage, etc) may help protect against osteoporosisInha University School of Medicine (South Korea), September 4, 2020According to news reporting out of Incheon, South Korea, research stated, “Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a common disorder resulting from increased osteoclastic activity.”The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Inha University School of Medicine: “To determine the effect of * * Panax ginseng* * on postmenopausal osteoporosis, ovariectomized (OVX) mice were treated with 500 mg/kg/day * * P. ginseng* * extract (Pg) alone or in combination with hot water extract of * * Brassica oleracea* * (Bo) daily for 10 weeks, and the effect of the treatments on OVX-induced bone loss was examined. 

- Single treatment with Pg or Bo did not alter OC formation; however, the Pg:Bo = 3:1 inhibited OC formation.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “In addition, Pg and Bo lowered the OVX-induced elevation in blood glucose level. 

- Thus, we suggest that Pg in combination with proper materials, such as Bo, might be a potential candidate treatment with minimal side effects protect against postmenopausal osteoporosis.”Rest Days Are Important For Fitness — Here’s Why, According To ScienceUniversity Of Aberdeen, September 4, 2020In 2017, world famous distance runner, Ron Hill, ended his record of 52 years and 39 days of consecutive running by taking a day’s rest after feeling unwell during one of his runs.Hill writes in his autobiography that he ran at least one mile a day, and tasked himself with training 13 times per week. 

- And numerous scientific studies show that rest days do indeed play an important role in helping us maintain good health and fitness.We usually define rest as a period of time without any training. 

- Exercise requires us to use our body’s energy stores (primarily carbohydrates) and fluids (in producing sweat), so rest and recovery give the body time to replenish these energy stores.Several studies have shown that the body needs at least 24 hours to fully replace our muscle’s store of carbohydrates. 

- Numerous studies have found it takes only around one to two hours to replace our fluids lost as sweat during exercise. 

- But our bodies still require several hours of rest following exercise to maintain hydration due to the continued production of urine.Training may also damage our body’s tissues. 

- But in order for muscle to recover and improve (known as physiological adaptation) they require several weeks of cycles of exercise and recovery.Research shows our bodies require a longer rest period in order to build muscle tissue (protein synthesis). 

- But given the turnover of protein for muscle, tendon and ligaments is between 0.4-1.2% a day, this shows there’s a constant exchange of protein in our body related to dietary intake, urinary nitrogen excretion and the added effect of exercise.The hours just after the initial workout may actually be most important for making this happen. 

- These changes are important, as when we increase our exercise intensity, we need to use glucose instead of fat to fuel our exercise.Longer-term adaptations, such as increasing the number of blood vessels in our exercised muscles, or increasing the size of the heart, are a much longer process, requiring months of training and rest to observe any measurable change. 

- Both adaptations are key to increasing our aerobic capacity.The quality of rest has also been a source of much interest, and sleep deprivation has been used as a tool to examine the effects of disturbed rest on exercise performance and physical and psychological function. 

- Based on the evidence, taking a rest day seems to be as important for progress and fitness as exercise itself.Probiotics may help manage childhood obesityUniversity of Piemonte Orientale (Italy), September 5, 2020Probiotics may help children and adolescents with obesity lose weight when taken alongside a calorie-controlled diet, according to a study being presented at e-ECE 2020. 

- These findings suggest that probiotic supplements and a calorie-controlled diet may help manage obesity in the younger population and reduce future health risks, such as heart disease and diabetes.Obesity is a global health concern and can lead to a number of life-threatening conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease. 

- Treatment and prevention is a serious public health challenge, especially in children and adolescents. 

- During digestion, they release chemicals called short-chain fatty acids, which play an important role in gut health and controlling hunger. 

- However, current research uses mixtures of different strains of probiotics and does not examine the effects of administering Bifidobacteria alone.Dr Flavia Prodam and her team at the University of Piemonte Orientale, aimed to assess the impact of Bifidobacteria probiotic treatment in children and adolescents with obesity on a controlled diet, on weight loss and gut microbiota composition. 

- However, larger studies over a longer period of time are needed to investigate this.Dr Prodam explains, "The next step for our research is to identify patients that could benefit from this probiotic treatment, with a view to creating a more personalised weight-loss strategy. 

- Curcumin suppresses aldosterone-induced CRP generation inHebei University of Chinese Medicine (China), September 2, 2020According to news reporting from Shijiazhuang, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Aldosterone regulates the initiation and development of atherosclerosis which is identified as a chronic inflammatory disease by promoting the generation of C-reactive protein in vascular smooth muscle cells.”Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Hebei University of Chinese Medicine: “Curcumin is the most active ingredient of turmeric with anti-inflammation and antioxidation effects. 

- We included RCTs of 7 d on adults regardless of health status that directly compared the effects of DHA with EPA and RCTs of indirect comparisons, in which the effects of DHA or EPA were compared individually to a control fatty acid. 

- DHA and EPA had similar effects on plasma adiponectin in the network meta-analysis.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Results from pairwise and network meta-analyses suggest that supplementation with either DHA or EPA does not differentially modify systemic markers of subclinical inflammation.”Common cold combats influenzaYale University, September 4, 2020As the flu season approaches, a strained public health system may have a surprising ally—the common cold virus.Rhinovirus, the most frequent cause of common colds, can prevent the flu virus from infecting airways by jumpstarting the body's antiviral defenses, Yale researchers report Sept. 4 in the journal The Lancet Microbe.The findings help answer a mystery surrounding the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic: An expected surge in swine flu cases never materialized in Europe during the fall, a period when the common cold becomes widespread.A Yale team led by Dr. Ellen Foxman studied three years of clinical data from more than 13,000 patients seen at Yale New Haven Hospital with symptoms of respiratory infection. 

- "The effect lasted for at least five days," she said.Foxman said her lab has begun to study whether introduction of the cold virus before infection by the COVID-19 virus offers a similar type of protection.Highly fluorinated chemicals can increase risk for diabetes and coeliac disease in childrenOrebro University (Sweden),  September 4, 2020Tuulia Hyötyläinen and Matej Orešič, both researchers in biomedicine, have published two studies on the connection between highly fluorinated chemicals—per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) – and two diseases in children: type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease (US spelling celiac, or gluten intolerance). 

- However, the incidence curve has flattened in recent years.Some children are genetically predisposed for type 1 diabetes, but only a fraction of them, around one-tenth, develop the disease. 

- It is clear that some environmental trigger is needed to initiate the progression to this autoimmune disease. 

- We have previously identified this profile to be associated with an increased risk for type 1 diabetes and the development of the disease in children," explains Matej Orešič.In another study published in Environment Research, Tuulia Hyötyläinen and Matej Orešič show a connection between PFAS and coeliac disease. 

- "These results show that high exposure to PFAS in the womb and in first years of life can accelerate the development of coeliac disease in children," says Tuulia Hyötyläinen.PFAS consists of some 5,000 man-made chemical substances in extensive use in society. 

- "Exposure to harmful chemicals in early life, including prenatally, may offer an explanation for the changing incidence of these autoimmune diseases in developed countries and can be connected to other health risks," says Matej Orešič.The increase of type 1 diabetes has flattened in many industrial countries, especially in the Nordic countries. 

- "Green tea could hold the key to reducing antibiotic resistanceUniversity of Surrey (UK), September23, 2020Scientists at the University of Surrey have discovered that a natural antioxidant commonly found in green tea can help eliminate antibiotic resistant bacteria.The study, published in the Journal of Medical Microbiology, found that epigallocatechin (EGCG) can restore the activity of aztreonam, an antibiotic commonly used to treat infections caused by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.P. 

- Another potential mechanism is EGCG's interference with a biochemical pathway linked to antibiotic susceptibility.Lead author Dr Jonathan Betts, Senior Research Fellow in the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Surrey, said:"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global public health. 

- Without effective antibiotics, the success of medical treatments will be compromised. 

- "Professor Roberto La Ragione, Head of the Department of Pathology and Infectious Diseases in the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Surrey, said:"The World Health Organisation has listed antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a critical threat to human health. 

- Fecal matter also was analyzed to examine changes in the microbial content.The research idea was generated by several of the paper's authors who are or have been health care providers with night-shift schedules. 

- "We hope to find an intervention that can help people who are at risk for cardiovascular disease because of their work and sleep schedules. 

- Our 5G Dystopian FutureRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDSeptember 4, 2020During the past two years, a large number of scientists, medical doctors and consumer activists have presented evidence, including testimony before Congress and state and city councils, that highlight the thousands of peer-reviewed studies showing the dangers of electromagnetic frequency (EMF) radiation on human health and the environment. 

- Due to the Clinton administration’s original telecommunications act, our local towns and communities are unable to prevent its installation despite the medical and scientific warnings. 

- Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Rick Perry, Betsy DeVos, agriculture secretary Sonny Purdue, Ben Carson, Kellyanne Conway, Labor Secretary Alex Acosta and the head of Health and Human Services Alex Azar are all ALEC alumni or insiders. 

- Pretty amazing.”He touted the traditional ALEC agenda to assure 5G rollout, without proper health and environmental risk reviews, will be highly profitable for private industry by removing public oversight“To accelerate and incentivize these investments, my administration is focused on freeing up as much wireless spectrum as needed — we’re going to free it up so they’ll be able to get out there and get it done — and removing regulatory barriers to the build out of networks…By next year, the United States is on pace to have more 5G spectrum than any other country in the world.”The ALEC-controlled FCC has already “adopted new rules that will reduce federal regulatory impediments to deploying infrastructure needed for 5G and help to expand the reach of 5G for faster, more reliable wireless service.”  More egregious is that Trump is committed to preventng any nationalization of the 5G network and to keep it in the control of private industry.Ajit Pai is a former Verizon attorney and a long time ALEC associate. 

- Several days ago, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate the shot for students, and other states such as New Jersey, New York and Vermont are in session to consider following suit.Although there is absolutely no confirmatory evidence to even suggest that the flu vaccine can prevent or protect someone from Covid-19, health officials nevertheless are eager to push forward with this ridiculous strategy. 

- We might be reminded of historian Daniel Boorstin’s insightful realization in his book The Discoverers: “The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.”  This is the dilemma of delusional thinking that pervades the biological, medical and cognitive sciences rather than the hard sciences of physics, chemistry and mathematics. 

- Whenever we are faced with proclamations from the medical establishment, and especially Bill Gates and the World Health Organization, when they advertise propaganda about safety and efficacy of many vaccines on the market, we must learn to take a step back and question their certainty.Rather than charging forward with bogus assumptions, it would seem wiser to consider several studies that indicate that rather than protecting us from potential Covid-19 infection, the flu vaccine actually increases our susceptibility to other infectious respiratory illnesses, including coronavirus strains.Sometimes our world has an unusual way of providing warnings that we have an opportunity to either heed or disregard to our benefit or detriment. 

- That same month, the prestigious journal Vaccine, published a study conducted by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. 

- This University of Hong Kong double-blind placebo controlled study followed the health conditions of vaccinated and unvaccinated children between the ages of 6-15 years for 272 days. 

- The trial concluded the flu vaccine holds no health benefits. 

- We have looked for firm and convincing medical evidence to even suggest that flu vaccines are a viable means to ward off Covid-19, and we can’t find it.Earlier we reported how the CDC has re-categorizing influenza and pneumonia cases as Covid-19. 

- German public health expert Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg notes that it is "the well known fact that in every 'flu wave' 7-15% of acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) are coming along with coronaviruses." 

- But even more important, they need to look at the volumes of studies indicating the flu vaccine’s lack of inefficacy to protect us from influenza and the vaccine’s terrible safety record and adverse effects.Sitting on millions of flu shots to be administered and handicapped with a past history of flu vaccines' feeble viral protection, and more Americans realizing the vaccine is either a sham or something not to be bothered with, the CDC and FDA are desperately pulling all of their stops to motivate people and their families to rush to their local WalMart, Costco or pharmacy to get inoculated.At their best, flu vaccines remain around 50-60% effective according to official health statements. 

- However, the World Health Organization’s predictions for 2014-2015 flu strains were a bust. 

- Reviewing 45,000 medical records of patients tested positive for influenza, researchers charted a trend that indicates that the "risk of contracting the flu climbs about 16 percent for every 28 days after vaccination. 

- The panic being orchestrated by the CDC’s inept response to Covid-19 should convince everyone that the agency is no longer serving public interests.Imagine the tens of thousands of children and families who would have been saved from life-long neurological damage and immeasurable suffering if the CDC was not indebted to protecting the toxic products of the pharmaceutical industry and was serving the health and well-being of American children? 

- And we can begin to further dismantle this citadel of despotic medical fascism by simply refusing the flu vaccine and protecting ourselves by adopting a healthier lifestyle during the flu season.NOTES[1] 105th International Conference of the American Thoracic Sociey, May 15-20, 2009 (quoted in , Sherri.

Wikipedia: Dumb and Dumber About FluoridationRichard Gale & Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, September 1, 2020In the satirical black comedy film Dr. Strangelove there is the iconic scene when the rogue general Jack D Ripper, played by Sterling Hayden, tells Peter Sellers character, “Ever hear of the fluoridation of water? 

- Do you realize that fluoridation is the most monstrously conceived and dangerous Communist plot we ever had to face?”From that day until now, the entire pharmaceutical industry, public health officials and the mainstream media have assumed that fluoride is absolutely safe, and anyone who dares to criticize water fluoridation and its dental use is a loon or conspiracy theorist who threatens national health. 

- Yet, as with so many medical and health challenges we face, the dominant consensus is wrong. 

- Earlier this year, an alliance of public health organizations and watch groups filed suit against the Environmental Protection Agency in a federal court trial to bring an end to fluoridation once and for all. 

- This benevolent description is posted without any context and stated as a matter-of-fact commandment that orally-consumed fluoride has no proven effect on dental health aside from causing dental fluorosis, an unsightly mottling of the teeth. 

- It references “the higher doses used to treat osteoporosis” after acknowledging earlier in the article that fluoride is utterly ineffective at treating osteoporosis, mentioning “pain in the legs” and “incomplete stress fractures when the doses are too high” (no comment on why a substance that causes stress fractures would be used to treat a bone-weakening disease like osteoporosis), as well as stomach irritation.According to Wikipedia, the only “clear adverse effect” of water fluoridation is dental fluorosis! 

- A Kenyan study published in the American Journal of Medicine and Medical Sciences reported that auditory working memory significantly declined as fluoride concentration in drinking water increased, confirming the results of an earlier systematic review showing lower IQ in children in high-fluoride areas. 

- These effects were observed at concentrations as low as 0.5 mg/L – the low end of the scale recommended by the World Health Organization, which recommends fluoridation at concentrations as high as 1.5 mg/L. 

- Another Mexican study found prenatal fluoride exposure positively correlated to ADHD symptoms in children as much as 12 years later, “consistent with the growing body of evidence suggesting neurotoxicity of early-life exposure to fluoride.” A pair of Polish studies published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences and the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health observed strong evidence for fluoride's role in triggering and progressing Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, given the substance’s role in oxidative stress and inflammation.Fluoride’s toxicity extends from the skeletal system, through the endocrine system, reproductive system, and neurological system, but none of these myriad effects are discussed in Wikipedia. 

- This represents hundreds of emergency rooms visits for fluoride poisoning at substantial and unnecessary medical cost.There’s a sound reason why so few of these kinds of studies are conducted in the heavily-fluoridated US and find their way into Wikipedia. 

- One study published in Medical Hypotheses touched on this discrepancy, finding organizational bias “can and does compromise the integrity of fluoride research.” The only logical explanation for how so many studies have found evidence of neurotoxicity and toxicity in other tissues – even sky-high rates of dental fluorosis, despite the prevailing wisdom that fluoridation is that it is “good for teeth.” Nevertheless this practice persists and the American Dental Association fully endorses this charade. 

- In fact, the actual analysis indicates that the best case scenario is a $3 savings, which is rapidly “eliminated by the estimated cost of treating dental fluorosis.”Ever since Harvard University researcher Philippe Grandjean first added fluoride to a list of developmental neurotoxicants considered especially harmful to the developing brain in a 2014 paper published in The Lancet, our health officials have suffered from institutionalized cognitive dissonance by categorically denying fluoride-induced illness. 

- Sadly, such an urgent endeavor would likely be completely ignored by the US's federal health and environmental authorities.In the meantime, Wikipedia is firmly lodged in this carry-over of scientific-naivety that was the public rage in the 1950s, when fluoride was the magic ingredient for whiter teeth, DDT would keep the bugs away, and humanity would be saved by our friend the atomic bomb. 

- The training protocol consisted of 5 weeks of treadmill aerobic exercise, for 60 min a day, 5 days a week. 

- Interestingly, the transcriptomic analysis using a large panel of isogenic strains of BXD mice confirmed that the Nmnat3 gene in the skeletal muscle is correlated with several mitochondrial markers and with different phenotypes related to physical exercise. 

- Finally, NR supplementation during aerobic training markedly increased the amount of type I fibers in the skeletal muscle.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Taken together, our results indicate that NR may be an interesting strategy to improve mitochondrial metabolism and aerobic capacity.”Long naps may be bad for healthGuangzhou Medical University (China), August 26, 2020Many believe that lying down for a snooze is a harmless activity. 

- The study is presented at ESC Congress 2020.1"Daytime napping is common all over the world and is generally considered a healthy habit," said study author Dr. Zhe Pan of Guangzhou Medical University, China. 

- "Previous research on the link between daytime naps and death or cardiovascular disease has produced conflicting results. 

- In addition, it did not account for the duration of night-time sleep.This study summarised the available evidence to assess the relationship between napping and the risks of all-cause death and cardiovascular disease. 

- Some 39% of participants took naps.The analysis found that long naps (more than 60 mins) were associated with a 30% greater risk of all-cause death and 34% higher likelihood of cardiovascular disease compared to no napping. 

- The connection was more pronounced in women, who had a 22% greater likelihood of death with napping compared to no napping, and older participants, whose risk rose by 17% with naps.Short naps (less than 60 minutes) were not risky for developing cardiovascular disease. 

- Dr. Pan said: "The results suggest that shorter naps (especially those less than 30 to 45 minutes) might improve heart health in people who sleep insufficiently at night. 

- "The reasons why napping affects the body are still uncertain, said Dr. Pan, but some studies have suggested that long snoozes are linked with higher levels of inflammation, which is risky for heart health and longevity. 

- Other research has connected napping with high blood pressure, diabetes, and poor overall physical health.He concluded: "If you want to take a siesta, our study indicates it's safest to keep it under an hour. 

- "Study suggests deficiency of vitamin D or selenium may decrease immune defenses against COVID-19Seoul Clinical Laboratories (South Korea), August 28, 2020According to news reporting from Yongin, South Korea, research stated, “The relationship between immunity and nutrition is well known and its role in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is also being paid greater attention. 

- However, the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients is unknown.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Seoul Clinical Laboratories, “Vitamins B1, B6, B12, D (25-hydroxyvitamin D), folate, selenium, and zinc levels were measured in 50 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 

- No significant increase in the incidence of deficiency was found for vitamins B1, B6, and B12. 

- However, patients without respiratory distress showed deficiency in 30/38 people (78.9%, P-value 0.425).”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “These results suggest that a deficiency of vitamin D or selenium may decrease the immune defenses against COVID-19 and cause progression to severe disease; however, more precise and large-scale studies are needed.”Alpha-lipoic acid supplementation associated with less inflammation among diabetics with history of heart attackBogomolets National Medical University (Ukraine), July 28, 2020The January-March 2020 issue of the Journal of Medicine and Life published the findings of a study that revealed a reduction in markers of inflammation among type 2 diabetics with prior myocardial infarction (heart attack) who received supplements containing alpha-lipoic acid.The study included 67 men and 45 women with type 2 diabetes and a history of non-Q-myocardial infarction who were being treated with oral antidiabetic therapies and basic cardiovascular medications. 

- Blood samples were analyzed for serum markers of inflammation that included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) before and after the treatment period.Upon enrollment, diabetics who received alpha-lipoic acid had serum CRP levels that averaged 2.7 times higher, IL-6 levels that averaged 4.4 times higher and TNF-a levels that averaged 3.1 times higher than the healthy control group. 

- They explained that alpha-lipoic acid inhibits nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-kB), which is associated with inflammation and other processes.The authors concluded that alpha-lipoic acid “can be used to reduce the activity of systemic inflammation as a predictor of diabetes and coronary heart disease progression.”How vitamin C could help over 50s retain muscle massUniversity of East Anglia (UK), August 28, 2020Vitamin C could be the key to better muscles in later life—according to new research from the University of East Anglia (UEA).A study published today shows that older people who eat plenty of vitamin C—commonly found in citrus fruits, berries and vegetables—have the best skeletal musclemass.This is important because people tend to lose skeletal muscle mass as they get older—leading to sarcopenia (a condition characterised by loss of skeletal muscle mass and function), frailty and reduced quality of life.Lead researcher Prof Ailsa Welch, from UEA's Norwich Medical School said: "As people age, they lose skeletal muscle mass and strength. 

- "The research team studied data from more than 13,000 people aged between 42-82 years, who are taking part in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) Norfolk Study.They calculated their skeletal muscle mass and analysed their vitamin C intakes from a seven-day food diary. 

- Richard Hayhoe, also from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: "We studied a large sample of older Norfolk residents and found that people with the highest amounts of vitamin C in their diet or blood had the greatest estimated skeletal muscle mass, compared to those with the lowest amounts. 

- "We are very excited by our findings as they suggest that dietary vitamin C is important for muscle health in older men and women and may be useful for preventing age-related muscle loss. 

- "Vitamin E supplementation shows promise as treatment option for NAFLDAristotle University (Greece), August 26 2020.Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis reported on August 18, 2020 in the Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology indicate a benefit for supplementing with vitamin E for individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD). 

- The disease is defined as an elevated percentage of liver cell fat in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. 

- Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is estimated to affect up to a third of the world’s population.For their review, Andreas Vadarlis and colleagues at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece selected seven randomized clinical trials that compared the effects of vitamin E to a placebo. 

- Four trials evaluated the effects of the vitamin in a total of 368 participants with NAFLD and three trials included 400 participants with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, an advanced state of NAFLD).Among the studies that examined the effects of vitamin E on the transaminase liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase and (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are elevated in patients with liver diseases, ALT was lowered by an average of 7.37 international units per liter (IU/L) and AST by an average of 5.71 IU/L compared to a placebo.Fibrosis score, considered to be the most important prognostic factor of NAFLD progression, significantly improved among those who received vitamin E. Histology parameters, including steatosis, lobular inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning, also improved in vitamin E-treated participants compared to a placebo.Among the subjects evaluated for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a significant reduction occurred in those treated with vitamin E. Additionally, fasting blood glucose levels and leptin were lower in comparison with the placebo group among those who received vitamin E.“Vitamin E could be considered as a treatment option in patients with NAFLD/NASH improving both liver enzymes and histological parameters,” the authors concluded.Meta-analysis affirms benefit for omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in cardiovascular outcomesUniversity of Milan (Italy), August 11, 2020Findings from an updated meta-analysis published in the October 2020 issue of Pharmacological Research support a protective effect for supplementing with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) against heart disease mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events and myocardial infarction (heart attack).For their analysis, researchers selected 16 randomized, controlled trials that examined the effects of omega 3 fatty acid supplementation among a total of 81,073 participants. 

- Interestingly, a combination of the omega 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was more effective than the use of EPA alone to reduce the risk of dying from cardiac conditions; however, EPA alone, which was evaluated in three trials, appeared to have a greater association with the reduction in the occurrence of major cardiovascular events.The authors of the report remark that the intake of one to two meals containing oily fish per week for general health as recommended by world health authorities provides only 250 to 500 milligrams per day of EPA plus DHA, and that an intake of omega 3 fatty acids well above this amount has been associated with a reduction in cardiac mortality among healthy individuals, as well as those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.“Stratified analyses based on levels of omega 3 PUFA above and below one gram per day highlight a relevant clinical benefit of the supplementation of omega 3 on coronary heart disease outcomes only when administered at high doses,” they observed. 

- Compared to those with hypomagnesemia (Level 1: < 0.75 mmol/L), the relative odds of incident cognitive impairment was reduced by 41% in the second level [OR (95% CI) = 0.59 (0.37, 0.94)]; higher serum Mg level did not provide further benefits [Level 3 and 4 versus Level 1: OR (95% CI) = 0.54 (0.34, 0.88) and 0.59 (0.36, 0.96), P for linear trend = 0.08].”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Findings from this prospective study suggest that sufficient Mg status within the normal range may be beneficial to cognitive health in the US general population.”

Desperate Times for Pandemic Lead to... Ozone?Case study in three patients with severe COVID-19 pneumoniaMedPage Today August 24, 2020Three patients present to a hospital emergency department in Ibiza, Spain, with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure and are given an unproven -- and possibly dangerous -- treatment: oxygen-ozone (O2-O3) therapy -- also called ozonated autohemotherapy, which has been used to treat gout and involves intravenous infusion of ozonated autologous whole blood.The FDA has called ozone "a toxic gas with no known useful medical application. 

- Likewise, his CRP levels began falling progressively after initiation of ozone therapy, from 10 mg/dL at the time of presentation to approximately 4 mg/dL on day 3 and about 0 mg/dL on day 21.Eat local foods to regulate blood pressure and reduce diabetes riskUniversity of Turin (Italy), August 26, 2020In a recent pilot trial, researchers from the University of Turin in Italy and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies (IHEID) in Geneva found that the increased consumption of foods purchased from local producers led to reductions in major risk factors linked to non-communicable diseases (NCD) after just six months.Their findings had been published in the journal Diabetes & Metabolism.Neither fat nor sugarIn their article, the researchers noted that the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has been studied for its influence on the risk of NCDs like diabetes and heart disease.UPFs include food products like packaged bread, biscuits and pre-prepared pasta dishes. 

- Plus, studies on nutrition and disease risk often focus on the impact of single nutrients like fats or sugars on health, not on additives in UPFs.The researchers speculated that these additives may be influencing disease risk, not just nutrients like fat and sugar.Local producers are safer sources of foodTo test their hypothesis, the researchers gathered 159 healthy participants in Italy. 

- Taken together, these factors indicate insulin resistance and a greater risk of both diabetes and heart disease.These findings support the idea that artificial ingredients in UPFs influence their impact on health and disease risk. 

- Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that the short-term consumption of foods sourced from local producers can lead to significant improvements in major risk factors for NCDs.The researchers recommend that the trial be conducted again in the future to involve a larger cohort and a double-blind trial to validate the results.Zinc therapy in early Alzheimer disease: safety and potential efficacyMolecular Markers Laboratory (Italy), August 20, 2020According to news originating from Brescia, Italy, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, “Zinc therapy is normally utilized for treatment of Wilson disease (WD), an inherited condition that is characterized by increased levels of non-ceruloplasmin bound (‘free’) copper in serum and urine.”Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Molecular Markers Laboratory: “A subset of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or its prodromal form, known as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), fail to maintain a normal copper metabolic balance and exhibit higher than normal values of non-ceruloplasmin copper. 

- Nevertheless, in the studied AD patients, zinc effectively decreased non-ceruloplasmin copper levels and showed potential for improved cognitive performances with no major side effects.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “This review discusses zinc therapy safety and the potential therapeutic effects that might be expected on a subset of individuals showing both cognitive complaints and signs of copper imbalance.”Magnetic stimulation dramatically improves fecal incontinenceMedical College of Georgia at Augusta University, August 26, 2020Painless magnetic stimulation of nerves that regulate muscles in the anus and rectum appears to improve their function and dramatically reduce episodes of fecal incontinence, a debilitating problem affecting about 10% of the population, investigators report.They have early evidence that TNT, or translumbosacral neuromodulation therapy, is a promising, novel, safe, low-cost treatment for strengthening key nerves and reducing or even eliminating episodes of stool leakage, Medical College of Georgia investigators report in the American Journal of Gastroenterology. 

- "We have identified that nerve damage is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of stool leakage, and we have identified a noninvasive and targeted treatment to correct the nerve damage and address this pervasive problem," says Dr. Satish S.C. Rao, director of neurogastroenterology/motility and the Digestive Health Clinical Research Center at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. 

- "We found there was significant improvement in fecal incontinence across the board," says Rao, after six sessions of weekly TNT treatment to key nerves, "which told us something is happening with this treatment. 

- Treatment lasts 15 minutes to an hour depending on the frequency. 

- We have not really approached it like that," Rao says.His team suspected their repeated stimulation of the nerves would induce their innate ability to adapt in response to a variety of stimulations, called neuroplasticity, a skill that exists in nerves throughout the brain and body that enables both learning as well as recovery from injury or disease. 

- He also wants to learn more about underlying mechanisms for how the nerve changes occur with magnetic stimulation and, along with colleague Dr. Amol Sharma, MCG gastroenterologist and a study coauthor, look at its potential in other gastrointestinal motility problems caused by conditions like Parkinson's disease and the stomach-paralyzing problem gastroparesis.How long benefits of TNT hold, and how often follow-up sessions may be needed are already being pursued in a larger study of 132 participants now underway at MCG and AU Health System and Harvard University's Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, on which Rao is also the project director and principal investigator.Participants for the published study were recruited from MCG's adult teaching hospital, AU Medical Center, and from the University of Manchester's Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre in the United Kingdom, under the supervision of Dr. Shaheen Hamdy, professor of neurogastroenterology, although all participants were ultimately enrolled at the Augusta facility.They went through extensive screening to ensure there weren't other medical problems, like severe diarrhea or inflammatory bowel disease, that could contribute to their incontinence, as well as a host of other serious medical conditions. 

- They also used TAMS to ensure the participant's nerves were responding to the stimulation.The only reported side effect of TNT was some temporary tingling in the treatment area, probably prompted by rejuvenating nerves, Rao says. 

- He also notes poor nerve conduction likely is a factor in some patients with constipation.Rosmarinic acid interferes with interaction between amyloid beta and copper, suggesting its use against Alzheimer diseaseUniversity of Siena (Italy), August 22, 2020According to news originating from Siena, Italy, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, “Alzheimer’s disease is a severe disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. 

- It is a very debilitating disease with no cure at the moment.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Siena, “The necessity of finding an effective treatment is very demanding, and the entire scientific community is putting in a lot of effort to address this issue. 

- The major hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease is the presence of toxic aggregated species in the brain, impaired metal homeostasis, and high levels of oxidative stress. 

- Several spectroscopic techniques and biological assays were applied to characterize the metal complexes and to evaluate the cytotoxicity and the mutagenicity of rosmarinic acid and its Cu(II) complex.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Our data indicate that rosmarinic acid is able to interfere with the interaction between amyloid beta and Cu(II) by forming an original ternary association.”Seven Reasons Why Skipping Rope Is So Good For YouUniversity of Hertfordshire (UK), August 25, 2020While many of us may remember skipping as something we did as children, the pastime has regained popularity during the pandemic as a way of keeping fit.Not only is jumping rope a fun, affordable and portable form of exercise, it also has many benefits for our health and fitness. 

- Here are just a few reasons why jumping rope is such a good form of exercise:1. 

- If you were to do ten minutes of jump rope everyday, you would create adaptations to your body that are beneficial to cardiovascular health, such as lowering blood pressure and reducing resting heart rate.Jumping rope will also increase your cardiorespiratory fitness which essentially means your body becomes more efficient at taking up and using oxygen.Research has shown that cardiorespiratory fitness is linked to improved health and longevity. 

- Improved cardiorespriatory fitness has been shown to reduce blood pressure, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation in the body and lower chances of developing diabetes and many other chronic disease.2. 

- These are important fitness components for later in life as they reduce our chances of trips and falls.There are so many different exercises you can do with the rope and each one requires different coordination to complete the exercise. 

- This may help exercise your brain as well.4. 

- It increases speedBecause jumping rope requires fast movement of the feet and arms, it’s considered a plyometric exercise. 

- This is where the muscles exert maximum force in short intervals of time, with the goal of increasing power.Plyometric exercise is used in the sporting world to increase an athlete’s speed. 

- A lot of exercises, such as jogging, only improve cardiovascular health – whereas jumping rope has the added benefit of improving speed as well. 

- Time efficientJumping rope offers many health benefits that may be achieved in a short period of time. 

- Because it’s a full body exercise that requires speed and coordination, you could argue that it’s a form of high intensity interval training (HIIT).HIIT exercise is where you have short bouts of high intensity efforts followed by a short rest intervals. 

- HIIT has been shown to produce higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in comparison to traditional endurance training.It’s also more time efficient, as you can perform exercise over a shorter period. 

- EnjoyableOne of the most important points we need to consider to help us change our exercise habits is that what we do needs to be enjoyable to us. 

- One of the biggest barriers for people when it comes to sticking with exercise is enjoyment. 

- And research shows enjoying exercise is critical for helping us change our exercise habitsand continue exercising.The great thing about skipping is that there are so many different ways you can jump, and hop over the rope. 

- As with all types of exercise, it’s good to build up duration gradually. 

- This will help minimise injury.Overall, jumping rope could be a very beneficial form of exercise. 

- Not only does it improve many important aspects of our health – including cardiovascular health, and improving bone density – but it’s also affordable, portable and doesn’t require much space.Depressed or anxious teens risk heart attacks in middle ageOrebro University (Sweden), August 26, 2020: Depression or anxiety in adolescence is linked with a 20% greater likelihood of having a heart attack mid-life, according to research released today at ESC Congress 2020.1In a warning to parents, study author Dr. Cecilia Bergh of Örebro University in Sweden, said: "Be vigilant and look for signs of stress, depression or anxiety that is beyond the normal teenage angst: seek help if there seems to be a persistent problem (telephone helplines may be particularly helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic). 

- If a healthy lifestyle is encouraged as early as possible in childhood and adolescence it is more likely to persist into adulthood and improve long-term health. 

- This study investigated whether conditions like depression in adolescence (age 18 or 19) are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood. 

- The assessments at the age of 18 or 19 years included medical, psychiatric, and physical examinations by physicians and psychologists.Stress resilience was measured by an interview with a psychologist and a questionnaire, and based on familial, medical, social, behavioural and personality characteristics.A total of 34,503 men were diagnosed with a non-psychotic mental disorder (such as depression or anxiety) at conscription. 

- Follow-up for cardiovascular disease was through hospital medical records.The study found that a mental disorder in adolescence was associated with the risk of having a myocardial infarction (heart attack) by middle age. 

- Compared to men without a mental illness in adolescence, the risk of myocardial infarction was 20% higher among men with a diagnosis - even after taking into account other characteristics in adolescence such as blood pressure, body mass index, general health, and parental socioeconomic status.The association between mental illness and heart attack was partly - but not completely - explained by poorer stress resilience and lower physical ?tness in teenagers with a mental illness. 

- Bergh said: "Better fitness in adolescence is likely to help protect against later heart disease, particularly if people stay fit as they age. 

- This is relevant to all adolescents, but those with poorer wellbeing could benefit from additional support to encourage exercise and to develop strategies to deal with stress. 

- "Frequent soft drink consumption may make adolescents more aggressiveUniversity of Alabama, August 26, 2020A study from the University of Alabama at Birmingham has shown that frequent soft drink consumption by adolescents may contribute to aggressive behavior over time.Previous studies have shown associations between soft drink consumption and mental health problems in adolescents. 

- It was published in the Journal of Adolescent Health. 

- "Despite public health policies designed to reduce children's consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soda taxes and school soda bans, the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by youth in the United States remains a significant public health problem," Mrug said.Reciprocal relationships were analyzed showing soft drink consumption predicted an increase in aggressive behavior over time.Soft drink consumption at ages 11 and 13 predicted more aggressive behavior at the next time point, the study showed. 

- High rates of soda consumption among U.S. youth have led to concerns about its impact on pediatric obesity and related health conditions. 

- Besides obesity, concerns have been raised about the potential impact of soft drink consumption on pediatric mental health, particularly for adolescents who consume more soft drinks and experience more emotional and behavioral problems than younger children. 

- "A number of studies have linked the consumption of soft drinks to adolescents' mental health problems. 

- Another recent cross-national study found a consistent association between adolescents' high sugar consumption (from soft drinks and sweets) and fighting, bullying and substance use in 24 of the studied 26 countries.All of these studies have included statistical adjustments for a variety of potential confounders such as child age, gender, BMI, physical activity, diet, substance use and family factors; but the key limitation remains the cross-sectional design.Although the results are typically interpreted in terms of soft drinks' contributing to emotional and behavioral problems, it is equally likely that mental health problemsmay be driving the consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, Mrug says.

- Therefore, combining probiotics with o-3 FA presents a promising strategy to promote beneficial immune regulation via the gut microbiota, with potential beneficial effects on conditions of inflammatory origin, as commonly experienced by aged and obese individuals, as well as improvements in gut-brain-axis communication.”Researchers argue health care systems should use 'food as medicine' interventionsUniversity of North Carolina, August 25, 2020An analysis recently published in the British Medical Journal argues for increased implementation of "food is medicine" interventions in the health care system. 

- The article was co-authored by Seth A. Berkowitz, MD, MPH, assistant professor of medicine at the UNC School of Medicine, who mostly recently argued in the New England Journal of Medicine that food insecurity is known to be a health equity issue that disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities and those with lower incomes and rural communities. 

- Thus, food insecurity is now playing a big role in the COVID-19 pandemic and associated health outcomes.Berkowitz has conducted a number of studies on health-related social needs and their effect on health outcomes, published in JAMA Internal Medicine.Sarah Downer, JD, from the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation at Harvard Law School is the first author of the BMJ study, along with Timothy Harlan, MD, at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dana Lee Olstad, Ph.D., at the Cumming School of Medicine at University of Calgary, and Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, MPH, DrPH, from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University.The world is facing an epidemic of diet-related chronic diseases with one in five deaths attributed to a suboptimal diet, more than any other risk factor including tobacco, according to the authors. 

- An emerging body of research suggests that nutrition interventions delivered in the health care system may be associated with improved outcomes. 

- "Food is medicine" is an initiative around integrating specific food and nutrition interventions in, or closely coordinated with, the health care system. 

- "Nutrition training delivered across disciplines holds the promise of more effective patient nutrition education and treatment," the authors write. 

- "Clinicians should have familiarity with validated nutrition assessment tools, the range of availability food is medicine interventions, and the systems and incentive structures that enable and encourage their use in clinical practice. 

- They also suggest that with these interventions, clinicians might see better disease management and fewer hospital admissions. 

- "As health care systems continue to evolve to tackle the global crisis of nutrition related diseases, food is medicine interventions should be held to rigorous standards when decisions about implementation, coverage, and care are made," the authors write. 

- "Food as medicine can no longer be excluded as outside or ancillary to health care delivery. 

- "Meta-analysis adds evidence to chromium supplementation’s glucose control benefits in diabeticsLorestan University of Medical Sciences (Iran), August 25, 2020A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 27, 2020 in Pharmacological Research found reductions in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, a marker of long term glucose control) and insulin resistance in men and women with type 2 diabetes who supplemented with the mineral chromium.For their analysis, Omid Asbaghi of Lorestan University of Medical Sciences and colleagues selected 23 randomized, controlled trials that evaluated the effects of supplementing with chromium on various glycemic control indexes. 

- Other nutrients that have been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes include vitamins A, C, D and E, beta-carotene, calcium, magnesium, potassium and zinc.“Present systematic review and meta-analysis of all available published randomized trials up to 2020 found a significant reduction in all glycemic control indices such as fasting plasma glucose, insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR levels after chromium supplementation,” they wrote. 

- “But, if anything, this study might help us move away from seeing intelligence as innate – it could be influenced by environment, and I think that is much more healthy.”White said it was reasonable to suggest more exercise and less stress as reasons for the higher IQ scores. 

- But now, exercise has been proven to increase brainpower, with researchers at the University of Texas earlier this year finding that aerobic exercise improves blood flow to regions in the brain associated with memory.2. 

- This study examined the effect of D-ribose supplementation on DOMS induced by plyometric exercise.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Sport University, “For the purpose of inducing DOMS, 21 untrained male college students performed a lower-limb plyometric exercise session that involved 7 sets of 20 consecutive frog hops with 90-s of rest between each set. 

- Muscle soreness was measured with a visual analogue scale 1-h before, 24-h after, and 48-h after exercise. 

- After a 14-d washout/recovery period, subjects performed the same exercise session, with DRIB ingesting a 200 ml solution containing 15 g D-ribose 1-h before, 1-h, 12-h, 24-h, and 36-h after exercise, and PLAC ingesting a calorically equivalent placebo of the same volume and taste containing sorbitol and b-cyclodextrin. 

- Muscle soreness and isokinetic muscle strength were measured, and venous blood was assessed for markers of muscle damage and oxidative stress 1-h before, 24-h and 48-h after exercise. 

- In DRIB, muscle soreness after 24-h and 48-h in the second exercise session were significantly lower (p

- Meanwhile, the expression of phosphorylated-JAK and phosphorylated-STAT5 was also decreased in cervical cancer cells treated by GLP, suggesting the inhibitory effect on JAK/STAT5 pathways.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “All of these data illustrated that GLP could alleviate the activity and aggressiveness, block the cell cycle, and promote the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells, which were possible via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal and JAK/STAT5 pathways.”Low vitamin D and K levels associated with increased risk of mortality during 14.2-year medianAmsterdam University (Netherlands), August 24 2020.A study published on August 18, 2020 in the European Journal of Nutrition revealed a greater risk of premature mortality among men and women with decreased levels of vitamins D and K.“Nutritional deficiencies have been recognized as important contributors to disease and increased mortality,” wrote Adriana J. van Ballegooijen of Amsterdam University and her colleagues. 

- “Previous analyses of our cohort indicated that sufficient vitamin D or K alone are associated with survival benefits and reduced cardiovascular disease.”The study included 4,742 participants in the Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-Stage Disease (PREVEND) Study who provided plasma samples between 2001 and 2003 that were used to determine levels of vitamins D and K. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as levels lower than 20 nanograms per milliliter and low vitamin K was defined as having a dephosphorylated uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP) level of less than 361 picomoles per liter. 

- Mortality data was collected through the end of 2016.During a median follow-up period of 14.2 years, there were 620 deaths, among which 142 were caused by cardiovascular disease. 

- Among the 970 participants with low levels of vitamins D and K there was a 46% greater risk of dying during follow-up in comparison with participants who had higher levels of both vitamins. 

- Therapeutic alternatives suggest that phenolic compounds can be part of the treatment for neuropathies and metabolic diseases. 

- The results show that GA treatment improved zoometric and biochemical parameters, as well as the recognition memory, in animals with MS. Additionally, GA administration increased hippocampal dendritic spines and decreased oxidative stress and inflammation. 

- Our results show that GA treatment improves metabolism: reducing the oxidative and inflammatory environment that facilitates the recovery of the neuronal morphology in the hippocampus of rats with MS.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Consequently, the recognition of objects by these animals, suggesting that GA could be used therapeutically in metabolic disorders that cause dementia.”Melatonin linked to improved brain function in child concussionUniversity of Queensland (Australia), August 19, 2020Melatonin could improve brain functions related to sleep quality in children recovering from concussion, according to a University of Queensland study.Using the latest brain mapping techniques, researchers examined Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans from 62 children before and after taking melatonin or a placebo in a randomized clinical trial.Child Health Research Center's Dr. Kartik Iyer said the study revealed that concussed children who received 3mg or 10mg of melatonin over a four-week period experienced significant improvement in whole-brain function and gray matter—brain regions which are essential for sleep control and cognition.Dr. 

- Iyer said the MRI scans enabled the team to rapidly assess millions of neural connections to help guide treatment response. 

- "We identified a specific 'network' of brain connections that positively responded to melatonin treatment, compared with placebo," Dr. Iyer said. 

- "Parents are advised to consult their doctor or neurologist if their child is having sustained sleeping problems following a concussion to assess their suitability for short-term use of melatonin.This paper was published in the Journal of Neurotrauma.Yoga, Tai Chi, and meditation bring specific benefits for veteransMedical Care supplement presents progress report on efforts to implement complementary and integrative health therapies at the VAEdith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital and Brown University, August 24, 2020Three popular complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies - yoga, tai chi, and meditation - lead to significant improvements in key outcomes perceived by Veterans receiving care in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) system, suggests a study in a special September supplement to Medical Care. 

- "[O]ur study showed that meditation, tai chi, and yoga appear to improve overall physical and mental health and reduced perceived stress," according to the new research, led by Dr. A. Rani Elwy of the VA Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research at the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Mass, and an Associate Professor in the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.Published today, the special issue of Medical Care documents progress toward implementing CIH therapies throughout the VA system - part of efforts to promote a "Whole Health" approach in VA care. 

- As required by the 2016 Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), the VA has expanded research and education on CIH programs, focusing on the impact on pain, mental health, and chronic illness.Improvements in Patient-Reported Outcomes with CIH Therapies Dr. Elwy and colleagues performed a 12-month survey study to examine the impact on CIH therapies on 119 veteran's self-reported health and well-being. 

- Three CIH therapies were associated with significant improvements in PROs:Yoga was related to decreases in perceived stress.Tai chi was linked to improvements in overall physical and mental health functioning, anxiety levels, and ability to participate in social role activities.Meditation was also associated with improvements in physical functioning.None of the CIH therapies resulted in improvement in Veterans' pain intensity or level of engagement in their health care. 

- They conclude: "It is time to focus on health and well-being, as defined by Veterans, and reaching these goals must include participation in CIH treatment approaches. 

- "More Progress in CIH Implementation and Research at the VA Titled The Implementation of Complementary and Integrative Health Therapies in the Veterans Health Administration, the new supplement presents 11 original research papers and commentaries on the VA's progress in implementing and evaluating the impact of CIH therapies on Veterans' health outcomes.

- "Excessive fructose consumption may cause a leaky gut, leading to fatty liver diseaseUniversity of California at San Diego, August 24, 2020Excessive consumption of fructose -- a sweetener ubiquitous in the American diet -- can result in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is comparably abundant in the United States. 

- "NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the world. 

- Multiple studies in animals and humans have linked increased HFCS consumption with the nation's obesity epidemic and numerous inflammatory conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer. 

- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, however, currently regulates it similar to other sweeteners, such as sucrose or honey, and advises only moderation of intake.The new study, however, defines a specific role and risk for HFCS in the development of fatty liver disease. 

- "The scientists noted that feeding mice with high amounts of fructose and fat results in particularly severe adverse health effects. 

- "That's a condition that mimics the 95th percentile of relative fructose intake by American adolescents, who get up to 21.5 percent of their daily calories from fructose, often in combination with calorie-dense foods like hamburgers and French fries," Karin said.Interestingly, the research team found that when fructose intake was reduced below a certain threshold, no adverse effects were observed in mice, suggesting only excessive and long-term fructose consumption represents a health risk. 

- "What are the health risks of low glutathione levelsNatural Health 365,  August 18, 2020ShareDespite advances in diagnosis and treatment, chronic disease continues to exert a lethal toll in the United States. 

- Close to 650,000 Americans die from heart disease every year, while the CDC reports that cancer is expected to claim over 600,000 lives in 2020 alone. 

- In addition, 5.7 million people are currently living with Alzheimer’s disease, the number one form of dementia among older adults (and the sixth leading cause of death). 

- Now, peer-reviewed research reveals a common thread connecting these illnesses – virtually all people suffering from these health issues exhibit low levels of glutathione.Clearly, glutathione – famously referred to as, the “master antioxidant” – plays an important role in health and longevity. 

- Today, we’ll focus on how to renew and replenish stores of this wonderful substance.Warning: Glutathione shortfalls linked with virtually all chronic health issuesScientists credit glutathione with the ability to attack viruses and bacteria, neutralize harmful free radicals, boost the immune system, fight inflammation, arrest the growth of cancer cells and combat heart disease.Unsurprisingly, having low glutathione can have serious health consequences.In fact, there are many integrative healthcare providers that warn the public about the health dangers associated with low glutathione levels. 

- Simply put, if you’re dealing with blood sugar imbalances, autoimmune disorders or poor brain function, being low in glutathione could be the reason for your health challenges.In a study published in The Lancet, researchers reported that elderly people demonstrated lower glutathione levels than younger individuals. 

- And, levels declined with age and state of health.In people who were both ill and elderly, levels were even lower – and were at the lowest in the hospitalized elderly.Warning: Glutathione deficiency is a massive threat to cellular healthIn a 2013 review published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, scientists concluded that Alzheimer’s disease may be triggered by oxidative stress in the brain resulting from decreased levels of glutathione.Research has also shown that low levels of glutathione can set the stage for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.A review published in PLOS One reported that diabetic patients had lower levels of glutathione when compared to a control group. 

- And, abnormal glutathione metabolism was more pronounced in patients with microvascular complications from diabetes.As with the Alzheimer’s disease study, the scientists concluded that glutathione plays a key role in preventing health issues and reducing oxidative stress.Significantly, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology found that elderly subjects with diagnoses of arthritis, diabetes or heart disease had significantly lower glutathione levels than subjects who were healthy.Natural ways to build up your glutathione levelsObviously, deficiencies should be avoided at all costs. 

- But, a wide variety of factors can drain stores of precious glutathione, leaving us at risk for health problems.Glutathione-robbing culprits include poor nutrition, exposure to environmental toxins, alcohol use, smoking, infections, sedentary lifestyle and chronic stress.In addition, common pharmaceutical and over-the-counter drugs – including acetaminophen and antibiotics – can contribute to low glutathione.What can we do to restore levels?The subject of oral glutathione supplementation is somewhat controversial, as some scientists maintain that the compound is broken down too quickly in the digestive tract to be of real benefit. 

- If you do choose to supplement with glutathione, a liposomal formulation is probably your best bet.Natural health experts typically recommend glutathione dosages of 500 to 1,000 mg a day. 

- Pregnancy symptoms such as nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy are predictive of a healthy pregnancy and women who experience them are likely to reduce their caffeine intake.But he adds that the dose-responsive nature of the associations between caffeine and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and the fact some studies found no threshold below which negative outcomes were absent, supports likely causation rather than mere association.Professor James concludes that there is "substantial cumulative evidence" of an association between maternal caffeine consumption and diverse negative pregnancy outcomes, specifically miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight and/or small for gestational age, childhood acute leukaemia and childhood overweight and obesity, but not preterm birth.As a result, he adds, current health recommendations concerning caffeine consumption during pregnancy are in need of "radical revision. 

- The Gary Null Show is here to inform you on the best news in health, healing, the environment.Pea protein-derived tripeptide shows bone-building potentialUniversity of Alberta, August 21, 2020According to news originating from Edmonton, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, “Osteoporosis is a bone disease affecting more than 2 million people comprising 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men in Canada. 

- One possible approach to prevent this disease is to stimulate the activity of osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) using food protein-derived bioactive peptides.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Alberta, “In our previous study, an ACE inhibitory tripeptide LRW (Leu-Arg-Trp) was identified from pea protein. 

- The tripeptide LRW treatment (50 mM) in MC3T3-E1 cells increased cell proliferation (4-fold increase) as indicated by BrdU incorporation assay. 

- Sen said: "Our study suggests that yoga has wide-ranging physical and mental health benefits for patients with atrial fibrillation and could be added on top of usual therapies. 

- But when coupled with fish oil supplementation, blood pressure also dropped, boosting the benefits of the exercise.These findings could help medical professionals develop intervention programs for adults with sarcopenia, as well as those with hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions.“Overall, our findings would provide meaningful implications for future clinical research to develop effective intervention programs for enhancing functional independence as well as cardiovascular health in older populations,” the researchers wrote.Fish oil supplements lower blood pressure levelsMuscle loss leads to reduced strength. 

- Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 2011–2012 estimated that about five percent of adults aged 60 and over had weak muscle strength. 

- Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention links muscle weakness to impaired mobility and mortality in older adults. 

- Meanwhile, only the group that had both resistance training and fish oil supplementation lowered their blood pressure levels, suggesting that the fish oil capsules have positive effects on blood pressure.Given these findings, the researchers concluded that resistance training and fish oil could be used as a therapeutic intervention for boosting muscular and vascular health, respectively.Harry Rice, vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs for the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s, said that the benefits of exercise on health have been known for years.But he added, “What’s really exciting about the results from the current research is that they suggest the addition of fish oil can boost those benefits.” Rice was not part of the study.A healthy lifestyle for cardiovascular health also promotes good eye healthTexas Tech University Health Sciences, August 20, 2020In a new study, investigators found that ideal cardiovascular health, which is indicative of a healthy lifestyle, was associated with lower odds for ocular diseases especially diabetic retinopathy. 

- "Earlier studies have observed associations between eye diseases and individual lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, or hypertension," explained lead investigator Duke Appiah, PhD, MPH, Department of Public Health, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX, USA. 

- "It is known that these metrics of ideal cardiovascular health do not work alone and may interact additively to result in diseases. 

- However, prior to our research, no other studies have comprehensively evaluated the association of all of the metrics of ideal cardiovascular health with ocular diseases. 

- "Most ocular diseases show few symptoms at early stages and many people may not seek medical care despite readily available treatments. 

- A recent online nationwide survey consisting of all racial and ethnic groups in the United States conducted by the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine showed that 88 percent of the 2,044 respondents considered good vision to be vital to overall health with 47 percent of them rating losing their vision as the worst disease that could ever happen to them. 

- Alarmingly, 25 percent did not have any knowledge about ocular diseases and their risk factors.This research shows that following healthy lifestyle and behavior habits can all contribute to good cardiovascular health as assessed by adherence to the American Heart Association's prescription for health metric known as Life's Simple Seven (LS7). 

- LS7 is based on the status of seven cardiovascular disease risk factors: not smoking, regular physical activity, healthy diet, maintaining normal weight, and controlling cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels.Practicing these healthy lifestyles together was found to be associated with lower odds for age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, cataract, and glaucoma. 

- Individuals with optimal cardiovascular health had 97 percent lower odds for diabetic retinopathy compared to individuals with inadequate cardiovascular health.Investigators evaluated data from 6,118 adults aged 40 or more years old who took part in the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. 

- "Overall, we believe that primary prevention and early detection approaches of ocular diseases are important, considering that over half of all deaths from ocular diseases and cardiovascular diseases are known to be preventable," commented co-investigators Noah De La Cruz, MPH, and Obadeh Shabaneh, MPH, both from the Department of Public Health, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX, USA.Since there is a significant overlap of the risk factors for ocular diseases and cardiovascular disease, the investigators recommended that screening for ocular diseases be incorporated into existing clinical and population-based screenings for cardiovascular diseases. 

- "While little is known about Megamonas in infancy, our previous research suggests there may be a link between this bacterium and asthma or respiratory viral infections, so vitamin D may offer additional benefits for childhood health that should be studied further," added Kozyrskyj, also a member of the Women and Children's Health Research Institute.The researchers also assessed the association between infant and maternal vitamin D supplementation and the presence of Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) in a baby's gut. 

- However, when the levels of gut bacteria become imbalanced, this particular bacterium can multiply, causing illness and increasing the susceptibility to chronic disease later in childhood," commented first author Kelsea Drall, an MSc graduate from the U of A and an AllerGen trainee.The study found that nearly 30 per cent of the infants carried C. difficile, but there was a lower incidence of the bacterium among exclusively breastfed infants. 

- "Low vitamin D levels have been associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)--a common lung infection among infants--and more recently, susceptibility to COVID-19 disease," she pointed out. 

- "In the CHILD Cohort Study, we have a unique opportunity to follow our study children as they get older to understand how microbial changes observed as a result of dietary interventions may be associated with later health outcomes such as asthma and viral infections. 

- "Ashwagandha linked to better quality sleep and less anxietyPrakruti Hospital (India), August 19, 2020Ashwagandha, a prominent herb in traditional Indian medicine Ayurveda, continues to gain support from the medical community as studies find how beneficial the herb is for overall wellbeing and health. 

- For centuries, the herb has been used to promote longevity, health, and rejuvenation, and this new research backs up its traditional use.Older adults enjoyed improved sleep, mental alertness, and overall quality of lifeThe trial involved aging adults between age 65 and 80, and half were give ashwagandha root extract twice a day and the rest were given a placebo.

The Gary Null Show is here to inform you on the best news in health, healing, the environment.Intense light may boost heart healthA novel use of intense light therapy may help decrease the tissue damage experienced during heart attacks, reveals new research in mice.University of Colorado, August 19, 2020The study, out of the University of Colorado and appearing in the journal Cell Reports, shows that exposing lab mice to intense light for a week improved their outcomes after heart attacks.The research also suggests that this procedure could benefit humans, and the researchers outline the reason why.“We already knew that intense light can protect against heart attacks, but now we have found the mechanism behind it,” says the study’s senior author Dr. Tobias Eckle, professor of anesthesiology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora.Boosting specific gene protects heartIn the study, the researchers discovered that intense light influences the functions of the PER2gene, which is expressed by a part of the brain that controls circadian rhythms.By boosting this gene through intense light therapy, the researchers discovered that the mice’s heart tissue received extra protection when it experienced issues with oxygen, such as during a heart attack.Additionally, this intense light also heightened cardiac adenosine, which is a specialized chemical that helps with blood flow regulation. 

- In concert, both benefits helped protect heart health.Also, when they studied the mice, the researchers found that being able to physically perceive light was vital, as blind mice experienced no benefits from the intense light.Humans had similar benefitsThe next step was to see if humans could benefit from light therapy. 

- Eckle explained that light plays an essential part in human health, not only in regulating the circadian rhythm but in cardiovascular health as well.He adds that according to prior studies, more people throughout the U.S. experience heart attacks during the darker months of winter, even in states that traditionally get more sunshine, such as Hawaii and Arizona.Study: Supplementation with curcumin offers benefits for patients with metabolic syndromeCoventry University (UK) and Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Iran), August 19, 2020A study published in the journal Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Review found that curcumin supplementation can help increase adiponectin levels. 

- Adiponectin is said to help reduce the risk of cardiometabolic disease.According to researchers from the United Kingdom and Iran, people with metabolic syndrome and metabolic disorders can benefit from taking curcumin supplements regularly. 

- Curcumin is the main active component of turmeric, an herb that offers plenty of health benefits.Increased levels of adiponectin through curcumin supplementationAdiponectin is a hormone produced exclusively by adipocytes, or fat cells. 

- Metabolic syndrome refers to a cluster of diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity.Study finds physical activity is beneficial for health, and more intense activity is betterCambridge University, August 18, 2020Physical activity of any intensity is beneficial for health, but more intense activity has greater benefits, according to a new study published today in Nature Medicine. 

- In the largest study to date of accelerometer-measured physical activity, a team led by researchers at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge analyzed data from more than 96,000 UK Biobank participants.Current physical activity guidelines from the UK Chief Medical Officers recommend that adults should aim to be active every day, and also that adults should undertake 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity (equivalent to a brisk walk) or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity (such as running) every week. 

- Previous research has shown that moderate and vigorous intensity activity confers greater health benefits than light intensity activity, but it has not been clear if this is because it makes a greater contribution to the total amount of physical activity, or if it has additional health benefits beyond this.A challenge facing researchers has been that the low intensity, incidental movement that accumulates in the course of everyday activities is very hard to recall accurately, and consequently difficult to measure using questionnaires. 

- Wearable devices have enabled better detection of this type of movement that makes up the majority of our daily physical activity, but until now have not been used on a large enough scale to determine if more intense activity makes a contribution to health, distinct from increasing total volume.The researchers used data from 96,476 middle-aged adults in Great Britain to investigate whether activity of moderate intensity or above contributed to a lower risk of death over and above its contribution to total volume of activity. 

- During this time 732 of the 96, 476 participants died, though the researchers excluded those who died within the first year from their analysis, and took existing conditions such diabetes, heart disease, and cancer into account as these might reduce physical activity.Expending more energy of any intensity was strongly associated with a lower risk of death over the following three years. 

- By gradually building up the intensity of physical activity we do each day we can improve our future health."Dr. 

- Søren Brage, also at the MRC Epidemiology Unit and senior author on the paper, added:"Our research shows how the use of wearable devices capable of measuring physical activity in large cohorts can help disentangle the roles of volume and intensity of activity in influencing future health. 

- The availability of data from nearly 100,000 participants in UK Biobank, backed up by a series of validation studies, allowed us to compare the impact of activity intensity in groups with similar overall volumes of physical activity, and demonstrate that more intense physical activity has health benefits beyond just contributing to total activity volume. 

- Taken together, this means that there are several different pathways to maintain good health and people can choose the path that works best for them. 

- "We already know that women with high blood pressure during pregnancy or those who experience menopause symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats have a higher risk of developing heart disease. 

- Dr. Faubion is the Penny and Bill George Director for Mayo Clinic's Center for Women's Health.Researchers analyzed the medical records of 2,684 women ages 40 to 65 who were seen for specialty menopause or sexual health consultations at women's health clinics at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, between May 2015 and September 2019. 

- "We know medical providers have historically done a lousy job identifying and following women with histories of high blood pressure disorders during pregnancy, despite knowing that they have a higher heart disease risk," says Dr. Faubion. 

- It is important that they not only receive education with regard to what they may experience during menopause, but also that they undergo routine screenings and counseling on how they can reduce their risk for heart disease. 

- cellular senescence), as a ‘first hit’ that challenges the adaptive stress-response pathways of the cell, increases the level of oxidative stress and renders the lung susceptible to subsequent injury and disease. 

- In both COPD and IPF, additional environmental insults such as smoking, air pollution and/or infections then serve as ‘second hits’ which contribute to persistently elevated oxidative stress that overwhelms the already weakened adaptive defence and repair pathways in the elderly towards non-adaptive, irremediable stress thereby promoting development and progression of respiratory diseases.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “COPD and IPF are thus distinct horns of the same devil, ‘lung ageing.”Citrus fruits could help prevent obesity-related heart disease, liver disease, diabetesUniversidade Estadual Paulista  (Brazil), August 11, 2020Oranges and other citrus fruits are good for you—they contain plenty of vitamins and substances, such as antioxidants, that can help keep you healthy. 

- "Our results indicate that in the future we can use citrus flavanones, a class of antioxidants, to prevent or delay chronic diseases caused by obesity in humans," says Paula S. Ferreira, a graduate student with the research team.More than one-third of all adults in the U.S. are obese, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

- Being obese increases the risk of developing heart disease, liver disease and diabetes, most likely because of oxidative stress and inflammation, Ferreira says. 

- "Ferreira adds, "This study also suggests that consuming citrus fruits probably could have beneficial effects for people who are not obese, but have diets rich in fats, putting them at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and abdominal obesity. 

- In addition, the team plans to conduct studies involving humans, Cesar says.Researchers find link between gut microbiome and cancer treatment outcomesStudy highlights positive impact of microbial diversity on immunotherapy response and suggests that cancer patients should eat a high-fiber diet with fruits, vegetables and grains with resistant starches.City of Hope Hospital, August 19, 2020Physicians at City of Hope, working in collaboration with scientists at Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), have found that greater gut microbial diversity in patients with metastatic kidney cancer is associated with better treatment outcomes on Food and Drug Administration-approved immunotherapy regimens. 

- "We also reported the changes over time in the gut microbiome that occur during the course of therapy -- the cumulative findings from our report open the door to therapies directed at the microbiome," said Sumanta Pal, M.D., one of the study's senior authors and co-director of the Kidney Cancer Program at City of Hope, a world-renowned independent research and treatment center for cancer, diabetes and other life-threatening diseases.The gut microbiome is composed of microbes like bacteria and viruses that reside in the gastrointestinal tract. 

- In recent years, an increase in knowledge about the microbiome in relation to general health has led to deeper explorations of its role in disease states, as well as how the organisms may interact with treatments. 

- The findings found that a greater variety of organisms was associated with a benefit to the patients, and also suggested that modulating the gut microbiome during the course of treatment may impact responses to therapy. 

- "The patients with the highest benefit from cancer treatment were those with more microbial diversity, but also those with a higher abundance of a specific bacterium known as Akkermansia muciniphila," said Sarah Highlander, Ph.D., a research professor in TGen's Pathogen and Microbiome Division and one of the study's senior authors. 

- "Our strong relationship with the microbiome team at TGen has fruitfully produced novel insights into the clinical implications of the microbiome in kidney cancer, among other cancer types," said Pal, who is an internationally recognized leader in the area of genitourinary cancers.Just last month, City of Hope and TGen launched a project to use one of the world's most comprehensive genomic analysis tools to map out personalized treatment plans for metastatic kidney cancer patients. 

- "Antiapoptotic effects of carotenoids in neurodegenerationUniversity of Alabama, August 17, 2020According to news reporting out of the University of Alabama research stated, “Apoptosis, programmed cell death type I, is a critical part of neurodegeneration in cerebral ischemia, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease.”Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Alabama: “Apoptosis begins with activation of pro-death proteins Bax and Bak, release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases, loss of membrane integrity of intracellular organelles, and ultimately cell death. 

- Over the last several decades, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated a protective role of carotenoids in neurodegenerative disease. 

- In this review, we describe functions of commonly consumed carotenoids including lycopene, b-carotene, lutein, astaxanthin, and fucoxanthin and their roles in neurodegenerative disease models.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “We also discuss the underlying cellular mechanisms of carotenoid-mediated neuroprotection, including their antioxidant properties, role as signaling molecules, and as gene regulators that alleviate apoptosis-associated brain cell death.”

- It also looked at bloodstream levels of zinc and vitamins C and D while taking the supplement, as these micronutrients are important for proper immune function.The immune indicators, including white blood cells' ability to kill incoming pathogens, were unaltered in the group receiving the supplement.The multivitamin group showedimproved vitamin C and zinc status in the blood. 

- "The multivitamin supplement used in the study focused on vitamins and minerals typically thought to help immunity. 

- "Honey found to be a better treatment for upper respiratory tract infections than traditional remediesOxford University, August 19, 2020A trio of researchers at Oxford University has found that honey is a better treatment for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) than traditional remedies. 

- In their paper published in BMJ Evidence-based Medicine, Hibatullah Abuelgasim, Charlotte Albury, and Joseph Lee describe their study of the results of multiple clinical trials that involved testing of treatments for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and what they learned from the data.Over the past several years, the medical community has grown alarmed as bacteria have developed resistance to antibacterial agents. 

- In addition to proving more effective in treating coughing (36 percent better at reducing the amount of coughing and 44 percent better at reducing coughing severity), it also led to a reduction in average duration of infection by two days.The researchers note that the reason honey works as a treatment for URTIs is because it contains hydrogen peroxide—a known bacteria killer—which also makes it useful as a topical treatment for cuts and scrapes. 

- Honey is also of the right consistency—its thickness works to coat the mouth and throat, soothing irritation.High intensity physical activity in early life could lead to stronger bones in adulthoodUniversity of Bristol (UK), August 17 2020The research, which analysed data from 2,569 participants of the Children of the 90s health study, found that more time spent doing moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) from age 12 years was associated with stronger hips at age 25 years, whereas time spent in light intensity activity was less clearly associated with adult hip strength.Peak bone mass occurs in young adulthood and is considered to be a marker of the risk of fracture and osteoporosis in later life. 

- Hip fractures make up a large proportion of the osteoporosis disease burden.Researchers looked at data from healthy individuals who had physical activity measured up to 4 times using accelerometers worn as part of clinical assessments at age 12, 14, 16 and 25 years. 

- The results highlight adolescence as a potentially important period for bone development through high intensity exercise, which could benefit future bone health and prevent osteoporosis in later life. 

- Our findings show it is really important to support young people to remain active at this age"Francesca Thompson, Clinical and Operations Director at the Royal Osteoporosis Society (ROS), said: "The ROS is working closely at the moment with Public Health England to review the importance of exercise for bone health in children. 

- Supporting and encouraging young people to be more physically active needs to be a priority for bone as well as general health. 

- Magnesium supplementation improved vitamin D status in the studied postmenopausal women.”High fructose diet in pregnancy impacts metabolism of offspring, study findsUniversity of Otago (New Zealand), August 18, 2020An increased level of fructose intake during pregnancy can cause significant changes in maternal metabolic function and milk composition and alter the metabolism of their offspring, researchers from the University of Otago, Wellington, have found.The research, which was led by Dr Clint Gray, a Research Fellow in the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, found increasing the fructose in the diets of female guinea pigs led to highly significant and consistent changes in the free fatty acids circulating in the blood of their offspring. 

- This was despite the offspring consuming no fructose themselves.The research is published in the international journal Frontiers in Endocrinology.First author, PhD student Erin Smith, says "previous research has shown poor quality nutrition during pregnancy can predispose offspring to long-term consequences, including the development of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life". 

- "Ms Smith says it is well known that increased levels of circulating free fatty acids increases the risk of obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease - with increased fatty acid synthesis shown to occur following fructose consumption.She says the evidence suggests suboptimal maternal diets, such as diets high in fructose and refined sugars, may be contributing to the rise in metabolic diseases in humans observed during the past 40 to 50 years. 

- This benefit was still noticeable 6 months later.The benefits of sleep could not be ascribed to participants' sleep quality or sleepiness, or to their short-term or long-term memory capacity, as the two groups showed no differences on these measures.The results suggest that alternating study sessions with sleep might be an easy and effective way to remember information over longer periods of time with less study, Mazza and colleagues conclude.Meta-analysis adds evidence to chromium supplementation’s glucose control benefits in diabeticsLorestan University of Medical Sciences (Iran), August 15, 2020A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 27, 2020 in Pharmacological Research found reductions in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, a marker of long term glucose control) and insulin resistance in men and women with type 2 diabetes who supplemented with the mineral chromium.For their analysis, Omid Asbaghi of Lorestan University of Medical Sciences and colleagues selected 23 randomized, controlled trials that evaluated the effects of supplementing with chromium on various glycemic control indexes. 

- Other nutrients that have been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes include vitamins A, C, D and E, beta-carotene, calcium, magnesium, potassium and zinc.“Present systematic review and meta-analysis of all available published randomized trials up to 2020 found a significant reduction in all glycemic control indices such as fasting plasma glucose, insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR levels after chromium supplementation,” they wrote. 

- “Furthermore, long term intervention contributed to greater reduction of all mentioned indices.”“The results of the current meta‐analysis study might support the use of chromium supplementation for the improvement of glycemic control indices in T2DM patients,” they concluded.Mangiferin: The Health-Boosting Antioxidant in MangosGreenMedInfo, August 12th 2020Mangiferin, a polyphenol found in mango fruit and plant extracts, possesses potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 

- Mangiferin has been shown to have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal health, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular health, and may have anticancer propertiesMango, a type of juicy stone fruit native to eastern Asia and India, is rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, fiber, antioxidants, micronutrients and minerals, and a unique polyphenol called mangiferin. 

- [i] While mango itself has long been touted for its health benefits, researchers are becoming increasingly interested in mangiferin, which can be found in the leaves, fruit, stone, kernel and stems of the mango plant. 

- [x] This decrease in glucose metabolism and increased insulin increases the risk for disorders like cardiovascular disease, fatty liver and renal diseases. 

- [xiii]Mangiferin Boosts Gastrointestinal HealthMangiferin has gastroprotective effects, leading researchers to believe it could be a useful therapeutic measure against gastric complications including diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss and anemia associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 

- [xxiv]Mangiferin treatment is also shown to increase enzymatic activity and reduce the formation of lipid peroxides, which researchers use as a marker for cardiovascular disease risk and vascular cognitive impairment disorders.

We are launching a campaign to reach out to the Foundation’s major benefactors and donors and to gratefully request that they discontinue their donations, grants and support to the WikiMedia Foundation. 

- The Foundation has refused to assume responsibility and to be held accountable for the abuse being perpetrated by individuals and groups promoting antagonistic ideologies against complementary and alternative medical therapies and its leading proponents. 

- While countless people around the world have benefitted from the breadth and scope of knowledge the encyclopedia provides, over the years it has come under growing criticism for its bias and lack of objectivity on many subjects that have a direct impact on people's health and well-being. 

- Distinct Skeptic groups, such as Guerilla Skepticism on Wikipedia and Quackwatch, now dominate and control a large swathe of Wikipedia entries that deal directly with CAM and the biographies of respectable, qualified practitioners and advocates of these natural medical disciplines. 

- Despite the volumes of peer-reviewed studies and articles cataloged in the National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine confirming the efficacy of these non-conventional therapies, Skeptic editors rely solely upon those studies that may be used for censure and defamation. 

- In 2019, the World Health Organization reported that “traditional and complementary medicine is an important and often underestimated health resource with many applications, especially for the prevention and management of lifestyle-related chronic diseases and in meeting the health needs of ageing populations.” Most prestigious American medical schools have a department for complementary and alternative medicine or include these subjects in their curriculum. 

- In the majority of the cases for alternative medicine's entries, senior and administrative editors have no medical-related background whatsoever. 

- There is some evidence that the Foundation, and/or some of its Board members, endorse Skeptics’ tenets and activities, including providing protection and privileges for them to carry out their agenda.SIGN THE PETITION
Avoiding Risky Health Behaviors Can Increase Lifespan by 7 YearsMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research and University of Michigan, August 12, 2020Study shows that those who do not smoke, are not obese, and consume alcohol moderately can live 7 years longer than the general population - spending most of these extra years in good health.A new study shows those who avoid risky health behaviors tend to live a long life. 

- Perhaps more importantly, those extra years are characterized by good health. 

- Examples of such “risky health behaviors” include smoking, consuming an excess of alcohol and eating to the point of reaching obesity. 

- The study's details were recently published in Health Affairs. 

- In fact, these individuals enjoyed a life expectancy beyond that of those living in Japan, a nation that is commonly considered to be the best example of how healthy living leads to an extended life.Most people think advancements in medical technology are a primary determinant of lifespan and health. 

- However, this study shows a healthy lifestyle can extend lifespan and improve health. 

- The bottom line is those who avoid smoking and obesity while limiting alcohol consumption will enjoy considerable health and lifespan benefits.This study is a trailblazer of sorts as it is the first to study the aggregate impact of numerous health behaviors on total life expectancy as well as one's odds for being afflicted by disabilities. 

- Prior studies examined single health behaviors. 

- Myrskyla and Mehta studied an array of behaviors to determine lifespan and level of health for those who avoided the most common behavioral risk factors.The pair of researchers found smoking, obesity and consuming an excess of alcohol were tied to reduced life expectancy as well as an earlier occurrence of numerous disabilities. 

- Excessive consumption of alcohol is tied to a reduced lifespan and a reduction in the number of years spent in good health.The most surprising finding was the massive difference in the average lifespan between the groups that were most at risk and least at risk. 

- This means the years one gains through a healthy lifestyle are years characterized by good health.This study's results show just how important it is for people to key in on prevention. 

- Avoid the risky health behaviors noted above and the odds of a long and healthy life dramatically increase. 

- Furthermore, policy interventions to target health behaviors might help significant portions of the population to enjoy the health benefits noted in the study.UCalgary researchers discover the microbiome's role in attacking cancerous tumoursFindings show how our gut bacteria can enhance immunotherapy to battle different forms of cancerUNIVERSITY OF CALGARYResearchers with the Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases at the Cumming School of Medicine (CSM) have discovered which gut bacteria help our immune system battle cancerous tumours and how they do it. 

- The discovery may provide a new understanding of why immunotherapy, a treatment for cancer that helps amplify the body's immune response, works in some cases, but not others. 

- She and her team are focused on harnessing the power of the microbiome to improve health and treat diseases. 

- "Inosine interacts directly with T-cells and together with immunotherapy, it improves the effectiveness of that treatment, in some cases destroying all the colorectal cancer cells. 

- "Generalized anxiety disorder is a very common condition, yet many are not willing or able to access evidence-based treatments," says lead study author Naomi M. Simon, MD, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU Langone Health. 

- "Our findings demonstrate that yoga, which is safe and widely available, can improve symptoms for some people with this disorder and could be a valuable tool in an overall treatment plan. 

- Of those treated with CBT, 71 percent met these symptom improvement criteria.However, after six months of follow-up, the CBT response remained significantly better than stress education (the control therapy), while yoga was no longer significantly better, suggesting CBT may have more robust, longer-lasting anxiety-reducing effects.Study DetailsThe study involved an evidence-based protocol for CBT treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, including psychoeducation, cognitive interventions (focused on identifying and adapting maladaptive thoughts and worrying), and muscle relaxation techniques.Kundalini yoga included physical postures, breathing techniques, relaxation exercises, yoga theory, and meditation/mindfulness practice.The stress-management education control group received lectures about the physiological, psychological and medical effects of stress, as well as the antianxiety effects of lifestyle behaviors, such as reducing alcohol and smoking, and the importance of exercise and a healthy diet. 

- Homework consisted of listening to educational material about stress, nutrition, and lifestyle.Each treatment was administered in groups of three to six participants, over weekly two-hour sessions for 12 weeks with 20 minutes of daily homework assigned.Can Yoga Help Treat Anxiety?According to researchers, generalized anxiety disorder is a common, impairing, and undertreated condition, currently affecting an estimated 6.8 million Americans. 

- CBT is considered the gold standard first-line treatment. 

- Yoga is well-tolerated, easily accessible, and has a number of health benefits. 

- "According to Dr. Simon, future research should aim to understand who is most likely to benefit from yoga for generalized anxiety disorder to help providers better personalize treatment recommendations. 

- Functional connectivity of the right middle frontal cortex (default mode network) and the right middle temporal pole (frontoparietal network) was positively associated with depressive symptom scores and negatively associated with n-3 FA intakes.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “In conclusion, high Omega-3 n-3 FA intake decreases the risk of depressive symptoms and modifies the brain functional connectivity in middle-aged women.”Study: Medical marijuana associated with fewer hospitalizations for individuals with SCDObtaining medical marijuana also associated with an increase in use of edible cannabis productsYale School of Medicine, August 13, 2020Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) who receive medical marijuana to treat pain may require fewer visits to the hospital, according to a new study in Blood Advances. 

- Adults with SCD who requested and obtained medical marijuana were admitted to the hospital less frequently than those who did not obtain it.SCD is the most common inherited red blood cell disorder in the United States, affecting an estimated 100,000 people. 

- According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, SCD affects one out of every 365 Black or African American births and one out of every 16,300 Hispanic American births. 

- More controlled studies of marijuana for the treatment of pain in SCD are still needed. 

- "When we offered medical marijuana as an option to our patients with sickle cell disease, we found the majority of people who were interested were already using illicit marijuana to treat pain," said the study's lead author Susanna Curtis, MD, of the Yale School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center. 

- And particularly for people with sickle cell disease, many of whom identify as Black, we know that while Black and white people use marijuana at similar rates, Black people are four times more likely to be arrested for possession. 

- Curtis and her team examined data from 50 individuals with SCD at the Adult Sickle Cell Program at Yale New Haven Hospital who were certified for medical marijuana use. 

- Of those certified, 29 obtained medical marijuana and 21 did not. 

- Those who obtained medical marijuana visited the hospital less frequently on average over the following six months. 

- Receiving medical marijuana was not associated with a change in emergency room or infusion center visits, total health care utilization, or opioid use. 

- Researchers did not observe any change to hospitalization rates in individuals who did not obtain medical marijuana.Dr. 

- Curtis suggested a possible reason for the reduced hospitalization rates could be that medical marijuana helps individuals better tolerate their pain at home.The researchers also sought to understand why many patients were unable to access medical marijuana, and why some continued to occasionally use illicit cannabis despite obtaining medical marijuana. 

- In a survey, individuals who obtained medical marijuana reported that they felt it was safer than illicit marijuana and they felt it was effective at controlling their pain; however, they did also report barriers such as greater expense and difficulty of access.Race and socioeconomic status may also be barriers for patients with SCD. 

- Medical marijuana is associated with significant stigma, and stigma is already a big part of the life of a person with sickle cell," said Dr. Curtis.Cannabis and cannabinoid products also present legal and medical challenges. 

- While 33 states have medical marijuana laws, only five of those states list SCD as a qualifying condition. 

- Medical marijuana products vary greatly in their chemical content and forms of administration. 

- In the study, patients who obtained medical marijuana were more likely to use edible products as opposed to inhaled products. 

- Curtis highlighted the need for further research to understand the efficacy, side effects, and drug interactions of various cannabis products on SCD treatment. 

- "My patients are living with a very difficult disease that causes them a lot of pain. 

- We need controlled trials to look at each product, and the effects of how it is taken, so that we can offer regulated, pharmaceutical-grade treatment options. 

- "This work builds on St Jacques' previous research on visual perspective in memory, which found that the perspective from which we recall a memory can influence how we remember them over time.Calcium-rich fermented foods preferred in improving bone and heart health, study saysNattopharma (Norway), August 9, 2020Calcium should come from healthy sources like fermented dairy products and leafy greens as a review outlines an approach to receiving an adequate intake while supporting bone and heart health.The review paper, published in the latest edition of the Open Heart journal, stated that the majority of the US population did not consume the current recommended dietary allowance for calcium. 

- The review also found milk and dairy products the most readily available dietary sources of calcium that were preferred by the general population.However, concerns as to these food’s long-term health effects were mentioned as milk, in particular was singled out as a promoter of inflammation and oxidation in adult humans. 

- Other measures included maintaining vitamin D levels in the normal range, and increasing intake of fruits and vegetables to alkalinise the system and promote bone health.Other research has shown that calcium supplementation can play an important role in boosting levels, especially in areas where healthy diets are less common.The average calcium requirement for young adults (18–24 years) is 860 mg/day as defined by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).EFSA also define the safe upper limit for calcium intake in adults, including pregnant and lactating women, at 2,500 mg/day.The findings that suggest milk as a less-than-ideal source of calcium will come as a surprise to many.Indeed, the review acknowledged that "cow's milk, though rich in many nutrients, including calcium, has issues that render it less than ideal as a dietary staple for many adults."

- The findings from the present meta-analysis provide sufficient evidence that dietary intakes of anthocyanins and berries are associated with a lower risk of T2DM, respectively,” wrote the researchers in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition .Booming berriesConsumer interest and demand for berries has grown rapidly in the US, driven by several factors, including the potential health benefits, improved quality and year-round availability,according to a 2012 article by Roberta Cook from UC Davis .“The berry category recently became the number-one dollar category in fresh produce departments, with national supermarket sales (excluding club stores, supercenters, and some other formats) projected to surpass $5.3 billion annually by June 2011,” wrote Cook.Many companies are also offering concentrated extracts from the products as dietary supplements, with brands such as Life Extension, Puritan’s Pride, and Swanson offering products.Study detailsAn example of one of the many berry extract dietary supplement products commercially available to US consumersThe new study, said to be the first to “evaluate the association of dietary consumption of anthocyanins and berries with T2DM risk”, assessed data from three cohort studies looking at dietary anthocyanin intakes and diabetes risk (200,894 participants and 12,611 cases of diabetes documented) and five cohort studies looking at berry intake and diabetes risk (194,019 participants and 13,013 cases of diabetes).Crunching the numbers indicated that dietary anthocyanin consumption was associated with a 15% reduction in the risk of T2DM, while berry intake was associated with an 18% reduction in risk.For every 7.5 mg/day increment of dietary anthocyanin or 17 g/day increment in berry intake the risk of T2DM decreased by 5%, added the researchers.Interestingly, there were some gender differences observed with the benefits from berry consumption observed for women and not men.“More prospective studies in other regions and ethnic groups are warranted to further explore the associations of dietary anthocyanins and berries with T2DM risk,” wrote the researchers.Scientists sound the alarm: Lockdowns may escalate the obesity epidemicUniversity of Copenhagen Health and Medical Sciences, August 13, 2020Scientists sound the alarm: Lockdowns may escalate the obesity epidemic Emotional stress, economic anxiety, physical inactivity and social distance - locking down society to combat COVID-19 creates psychosocial insecurity that leads to obesity, warn three Danish researchers. 

- "We are concerned that policy makers do not fully understand how strategies such as lockdowns and business closures could fuel the rise of obesity - a chronic disease with severe health implications, but with few reliable treatment options," says Associate Professor Christoffer Clemmensen, from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR), at the University of Copenhagen.Alone, inactive and hungryIn a letter published in the scientific journal Nature Reviews Endocrinology, Clemmensen and two co-authors outlined how COVID-19 containment strategies could increase rates of obesity.Firstly, it is well documented that people with limited economic resources are more likely eat highly-processed and energy-rich food. 

- Sørensen from CBMR at the University of Copenhagen, stresses that we still do not exactly understand how a person's mental health and economic status end up increasing a person's risk of developing obesity. 

- "We know that there are links between obesity and a person's class and mental health, but we don't exactly understand how they make an impact," says Sørensen.More research is needed to uncover the cause and effect, but the three co-authors say the scientific expectations are clear: physical distancing and rising rates of unemployment should lead us to expect increased rates of obesity.Together they urge governments and decision makers to consider what impact COVID-19 containment strategies, such as lockdowns, will have on the public's metabolic health. 

- Lipoic acid supplements help some obese but otherwise healthy people lose weightOregon State University, August 12, 2020A compound given as a dietary supplement to overweight but otherwise healthy people in a clinical trial caused many of the patients to slim down, research by Oregon State University and Oregon Health & Science University showed.The research, published in the Journal of Nutrition, analyzed the effects of 24 weeks of daily, 600-milligram doses of lipoic acid supplements on 31 people, with a similarly sized control group receiving a placebo. 

- They include the stimulation of glucose metabolism, antioxidant defenses and anti-inflammatory responses - making it a possible complementary treatment for people with diabetes, heart disease and age-related cognitive decline. 

- "Scientists have been researching the potential health benefits of lipoic acid supplements for decades, including how it might enhance healthy aging and mitigate cardiovascular disease," said Alexander Michels, another Linus Pauling Institute scientist involved with the study. 

- "Many existing clinical studies using lipoic acid have focused on volunteers with pre-existing conditions like diabetes, making it difficult to determine if lipoic acid supplements simply act as a disease treatment or have other beneficial health effects," said Hagen, principal investigator and Helen P. Rumbel Professor for Healthy Aging Research at the institute. 

- The treatment lasted eight weeks.In the first four weeks of the study, participants in the meditation-relaxation group experienced sleep paralysis on average 14 times over 11 days. 

- "If the researchers are able to replicate their findings in a larger number of people - including those from the general population, not affected by narcolepsy - then this could offer a relatively simple treatment that could be delivered online or via a smartphone to help patients cope with the condition. 

- "Why walking to work may be better for you than a casual strollStudy finds people walk faster, report being healthier, when they walk with a purposeOhio State University, August 12, 2020Walking with a purpose - especially walking to get to work - makes people walk faster and consider themselves to be healthier, a new study has found.The study, published online earlier this month in the Journal of Transport and Health, found that walking for different reasons yielded different levels of self-rated health. 

- People who walked primarily to places like work and the grocery store from their homes, for example, reported better health than people who walked mostly for leisure. 

- "We found that walking for utilitarian purposes significantly improves your health, and that those types of walking trips are easier to bring into your daily routine," said Gulsah Akar, an associate professor of city and regional planning in The Ohio State University Knowlton School of Architecture. 

- "The study used data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, a U.S. dataset collected from April 2016 to May 2017.The researchers analyzed self-reported health assessments from 125,885 adults between the ages of 18 and 64. 

- The dataset the researchers analyzed included more than 500,000 trips.The researchers - Akar and Ohio State doctoral student Gilsu Pae - found that walking for any duration, for any purpose, increased how healthy a person felt.But they also found that an additional 10 minutes of walking per trip from home for work-based trips - say, from a person's house to the bus stop 10 minutes away - increased that person's odds of having a higher health score by 6 percent compared with people who walk for other reasons. 

- People who walked from home for reasons not connected to work, shopping or recreation were 3 percent more likely to have a higher health score.And, the researchers found, people who walked for work walked faster - on average, about 2.7 miles per hour - than people who walked for other reasons. 

- "And that is true, but walking for some purposes has significantly greater effect on our health than others. 

- "That means going to a gym or a recreation center aren't the only ways to exercise," Akar said. 

- She explained that the microbial pool that organic apple trees are exposed to tends to be more diverse and more balanced, and this helps promote their health by bolstering their resistance to pathogens.

- These guidelines include factors like soil additives, pesticide use and how animals are raised.On the other hand, conventional refers to modern, industrial agriculture that uses chemical fertilizers, pesticides and genetically modified organisms (GMOs).Research suggests that organic produce has a similar nutritional profile to conventional produce, but the former helps reduce your exposure to pesticides and harmful bacteria.When buying produce, consider other health factors like chronic conditions or pregnancy. 

- In both scenarios, a smile was induced by participants holding a pen between their teeth, forcing their facial muscles to replicate the movement of a smile.The research found that facial muscular activity not only alters the recognition of facial expressions but also body expressions, with both generating more positive emotions.Lead researcher and human and artificial cognition expert, UniSA's Dr. Fernando Marmolejo-Ramos says the finding has important insights for mental health. 

- For mental health, this has interesting implications. 

- If we can trick the brain into perceiving stimuli as 'happy', then we can potentially use this mechanism to help boost mental health. 

- "Coriander is a potent weapon against antibiotic resistant bacteriaUniversity of Beira Interior (Portugal) August 10, 2020The problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria has been deemed a public health crisis, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting that invasive MRSA – or methicillin-resistant S. aureus – infections affect 80,000 people globally a year, and claim over 11,000 lives. 

- But, what the CDC will never tell you is how coriander can potentially save lives.Researchers in Portugal now say that that the oil from coriander – a common kitchen spice – is quite toxic to a wide range of harmful bacteria, leading to hopes that it may be enlisted in the fight against MRSA and other pathogens.Researchers at University of Beira Interior used flow cytometry to study the effects of coriander oil on 12 different disease-causing types of bacteria, including E. coli, Salmonella, B. cereus and MRSA. 

- In the study, published in Journal of Medical Microbiology, the oil significantly inhibited bacterial growth – especially that of MRSA and E. coli.Researchers found that the coriander oil worked by damaging the membrane around the bacterial cell, interfering with vital functions such as respiration and eventually causing cell death.Linalool, a terpenoid responsible for coriander’s pleasant scent, is the main constituent, but the coriander oil outperformed linalool alone – showing that interactions between the components in coriander oil made it even more bactericidal.Finally, the team found that coriander tended to perform better on Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella – as it could more easily disrupt their cell membranes.Lead researcher Dr. Fernanda Domingues noted that using coriander in foods could help prevent bacterial spoilage and food-borne illnesses, and possibly function as a natural alternative to pharmaceutical antibiotics. 

- Coriander essential oil is one of the most widely-used in the world, and is already in use as a food additive.The need to develop safe, non-chemical preservatives – and the need to find natural solutions for antibiotic resistant bacteria – mean that studies on natural, herbal substances such as coriander are a “research hotspot.”Coriander has impressed researchers with its antimicrobial properties, and additional studies attest to that fact.In a study published in International Journal of Food Nutrition and Safety, researchers found that a water extract of coriander had a very strong inhibitory effect on E. coli and B.subtilis. 

- Many serotypes of E.coli can cause illness, and B. subtilis, while not a disease-causing pathogen, can contaminate food, and cause potatoes to rot.Researchers found that the coriander extract worked best to inhibit bacteria when it was prepared in a concentration of 10 percent, with a pH of 6 and a salt concentration of 2 percent.And, a 2015 study published in Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition showed that coriander seed oil exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria – along with some yeasts and fungi. 

- The CDC reports that a type of infection called STEC – Shiga toxin-producing E. coli – strikes a whopping 265,000 people every year in the United States alone, causing symptoms of severe stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhea.And, finally, coriander seed oil – non-toxic, non-chemical, and packed with beneficial flavonoids – may very well be the food preservative and antibacterial agent of the future.Exercise can improve mental healthMcGill University (Quebec), August 10, ,2020One in four men in the world suffer from mental health issues. 

- More men than women die from mental health issues. 

- Dr. Farhan Khawajawho holds a Ph.D in Neuroscience from Mcgill University has said that regular fitness routines can help reduce the number of people whosuffer from long term mental health issues and can save lives.Dr. 

- Farhan Khawaja has launched a campaign to make men aware of how important regular fitness is to their mental health and well-being. 

- The fitness experts have said regular exercise can help deal with stress and reduce mental health problems.According to a recent report, more than 450 million people in the world suffer from mental health issues. 

- In the UK more than 16 million people suffer from stress and mental health problems, in the USA that figure stands at 46.6 million. 

- The World Health Organization has said that one in four men suffer from mental health problems and men are more likely than women to lose their life to this rising killer disease. 

- Dr. Farah Khawaja who has called for more to be done to help men who suffer from stress and depression, and mental health problems want more men to turn to exercise to beat this rising problem. 

- "Exercise and going to the gym and running in the park is not just about losing weight, it can also help with people's well-being. 

- It is the perfect way to help a person to fight the negative feelings they have," explained Dr. Farhan Khawaja.In 2019, 6507 deaths were recorded due to suicide, in the USA 129 people take their own life due to mental health problems. 

- Those figures show the importance of why more needs to be done according to Dr. Farhan Khawaja.It is not just Dr. Farhan Khawaja who has said that regular exercise can help fight depression, stress, and anxiety, scientists have also written many reports on the subject. 

- They have said they have found through studies that exercise can reduce the levels of tension a person may feel and can help elevate and stabilize mood, improve sleep patterns, and improve a person's self-esteem. 

- According to one scientist report, even five minutes of aerobic exercise can have a positive impact on someone suffering from anxiety and stress. 

- "We want to see more people exercise. 

- They don't have to join an expensive gym; they can do exercise in the home or at the park. 

- Through regular exercise it can help boost a person's overall mood and well-being," explained Dr. Farhan Khawaja.Dr. 

- More than one-third of U.S. adults are considered to be obese, according to federal statistics.The new testing system developed for the study has the potential to provide a much-needed, safe and cost-effective method that can be used to evaluate the health effects of thousands of existing and new chemicals in the environment, the investigators say.For their experiments, Sareen and his team first obtained blood samples from adults, and then, by introducing reprogramming genes, converted the cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. 

- While other scientists have found, in animal studies, that effects of endocrine disruptors can be passed down to future generations, this process has not been proved to occur in humans, he explained.More than 80,000 chemicals are registered for use in the U.S. in everyday items such as foods, personal care products, household cleaners and lawn-care products, according to the National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 

- While the program states on its website that relatively few chemicals are thought to pose a significant risk to human health, it also states: "We do not know the effects of many of these chemicals on our health. 

- "Cost and ethical issues, including the health risk of exposing human subjects to possibly harmful substances, are among the barriers to testing the safety of many chemicals. 

- As a result, numerous widely used compounds remain unevaluated in humans for their health effects, especially to the hormone system.

- Among other risk factors, more and more studies point to diet as a major factor in the development of prostate cancer, as it is for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. 

- The study did not show any clear link between a Western diet with salt and alcohol and the risk of developing the disease.Moving away from the typical approach used in epidemiological studies, which involves looking at one nutrient or food group at a time, the researchers collected data from a broader dietary profile.

- They also identified trigonelline, a plant hormone, as the active component in Sakurajima Daikon that appears to promote a cascade of changes in coronary blood vessels resulting improved nitric oxide production.Placebos prove powerful even when people know they're taking oneMichigan State University, August 7, 2020How much of a treatment is mind over matter? 

- It is well documented that people often feel better after taking a treatment without active ingredients simply because they believe it's real -- known as the placebo effect.A team of researchers from Michigan State University, University of Michigan and Dartmouth College is the first to demonstrate that placebos reduce brain markers of emotional distress even when people know they are taking one.Now, evidence shows that even if people are aware that their treatment is not "real" -- known as nondeceptive placebos -- believing that it can heal can lead to changes in how the brain reacts to emotional information. 

- The result suggests that the inverse association of coffee intake with depressive symptoms might be associated with not only caffeine intake but also some other substances in coffee or factors related to coffee intake.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Because of the cross-sectional design of the present study, longitudinal studies are required to confirm the present finding.”Sugary drinks and disease: Chugging 2 sodas per day increases your risk of premature deathUniversity College Dublin (Ireland), August 8, 2020On top of raising blood sugar and contributing to abdominal fat, European researchers found that soda can also lead to an earlier death.Published in JAMA Internal Medicine, the study demonstrates that daily consumption of two or more sodas – diet or not – and other sweetened drinks corresponds to a 17 percent increase in the risk of premature death from all causes.The “bitter truth” of soda consumption: premature deathTo examine the relationship between soda consumption and the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality, the researchers studied 451,743 individuals living in 10 European countries, including Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.The participants were from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EIPC) study, one of the largest ongoing cohort studies on diet and its relation to cancer and other chronic diseases. 

- The team reported that those who drank diet sodas also had a greater risk of earlier death from cardiovascular disease(CVD).Taken together, these findings indicate that the consumption of soda, diet soda and other sweetened beverages is linked to premature death from all causes, including CVD and digestive diseases.The researchers noted that their study supports public health campaigns aimed at limiting the consumption of sodas and other sugar-laden drinks.Fisetin derivative shows promise against Alzheimer disease in miceSalk Institute, August 5 2020.he September 2020 issue of Redox Biology published the finding of Salk Institute researchers of an ability for a compound derived from fisetin, a flavonoid occurring in many plants, to reverse memory loss in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease.

- "Further studies will be required, to evaluate the inhibitory effect in vivo and explore the potential mechanisms of curcumin against TGEV, which will lay a foundation for the comprehensive understanding of the antiviral mechanisms and application of curcumin" said Dr Xie.A quarter of arthritis cases linked to excess weightWeight loss from young adulthood to midlife was associated with substantially reduced risk of developing arthritisBoston University, August 4, 2020A new Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) study shows that weight loss between early adulthood and midlife lowers arthritis risk, and found no evidence of any persistent risk of arthritis for people who were heavier earlier in life and then lost weight.The study, published in the journal Arthritis Care & Research, also estimates that nearly a quarter of arthritis cases in the U.S., corresponding to 2.7 million people, are attributable to excess weight. 

- Our findings suggest that such measures could have a significant impact on reducing the incidence of arthritis, a leading cause of disability and chronic pain in the US," says study corresponding author Dr. Andrew Stokes, assistant professor of global health at BUSPH. 

- "Although weight loss could represent a viable way to reduce arthritis risk at the individual level, we found that the best solution at the population level would be to prevent weight gain," says study lead author and BUSPH alumna Kaitlyn Berry, who was a research fellow at BUSPH while working on the study and is now at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health.The researchers used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on adults 40-69 years old, to categorize individuals based on the changes in their body mass indices (BMI) from early adulthood to mid-life, and analyzed the association between these BMI trajectories and the risk of developing an arthritis condition within 10 years.Of the 13,669 people in the study, 3,603 developed an arthritis condition. 

- "These findings highlight the need for lifelong public health measures to prevent obesity at younger ages as an important step to curb later life musculoskeletal and joint health problems such as osteoarthritis. 

- This is particularly important as musculoskeletal pain is a leading cause of disability globally," says study co-author Dr. Tuhina Neogi, professor of epidemiology at BUSPH, professor of medicine at the Boston University School of Medicine, and chief of rheumatology at Boston Medical Center.Consumption of a blueberry enriched diet by women for six weeks alters determinants of human muscle progenitor cell functionCornell University, August 5, 2020A new research study, published in the Journal of Nutrition, investigated how serum from subjects consuming a diet enriched with blueberries would affect the cells responsible for muscle growth and repair. 

- "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), muscles lose strength, flexibility, and endurance over time. 

- Therefore, strategies to improve muscle progenitor cell proliferation and lower oxidative stress may also benefit muscle regeneration during the aging process.Research on the role that blueberries may play in promoting good health is ongoing across multiple areas, including cardiovascular health, diabetes management, brain health, exercise and the gut microbiome.From mitochondria to healthy aging: role of branched-chain amino acid treatmentUniversity of Turin (Italy), August 3, 2020According to news originating from Turin, Italy, research stated, “Malnutrition often affects elderly patients and significantly contributes to the reduction in healthy life expectancy, causing high morbidity and mortality. 

- Both groups improved in nutritional status, general health and muscle mass, strength and performance; treatment with BCAAem supplementation was more effective than simple diet advice in increasing MMSE (1.2 increase versus 0.2, p = 0.0171), ATP production (0.43 increase versus -0.1, p = 0.0001), electron flux (0.50 increase versus 0.01, p< 0.0001) and in maintaining low oxidative stress. 

- The amelioration of clinical parameters as MMSE, balance, four meter walking test were associated to increased mitochondrial function.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Overall, our findings show that sustaining nutritional support might be clinically relevant in increasing physical performance in elderly malnourished patients and that the use of specific BCAAem might ameliorate also cognitive performance thanks to an amelioration of mitochondria bioenergetics.”20-year sedentary lifestyle linked to twice the risk of premature death: Being physically active is key to a longer lifeNorweign University of Science and Technology, August 4, 202It’s easy to fall into the habit of skipping exercise because you’re busy with work or chores. 

- Yet according to a study, having a sedentary lifestyle for at least 20 years is linked to twice the risk of premature death, especially compared to those who exercise regularly.Results from the Trøndelag Health Study (the HUNT study) was presented at ESC Congress 2019 and the World Congress of Cardiology.The HUNT study was conducted to determine how changes in physical activity within two decades were linked to “subsequent death from all causes and from cardiovascular disease.”Other studies on the association between physical activity and longevity only ask volunteers about their level of physical activity once and followed them for several years. 

- The physical activity data were linked to information on deaths until the end of 2013 via the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry.The risk of death in the two physical activity groups was compared to the reference group, which included participants who reported a high level of exercise during both surveys.Analyses were also adjusted for factors that influence prognosis:AgeBlood pressureBody mass index (BMI)Education levelSexSmokingUnlike volunteers in the reference group, participants who were inactive in both 1984-1986 and 2006-2008 had twice the risk of premature death and a 2.7-fold greater risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.Compared to the reference group, participants with moderate activity at both time points had a 60 percent and 90 percent greater risk of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths, respectively.Exercising consistently is keyDr. 

- Trine Moholdt, a study author from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology at Trondheim, Norway, explained that to reap the maximum health benefits of physical activity and prevent premature all-cause and cardiovascular death, people must be physically active consistently.Moholdt noted that even if you had a sedentary lifestyle, you can still reduce your risk by exercising later in life. 

- Adults should have at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity a week to effectively boost their overall well-being.But these numbers aren’t set in stone, said Moholdt. 

- She added that even exercise below the recommended levels will offer some benefits.Instead of focusing on how much you’re exercising, Moholdt suggests setting goals to be more physically fit. 

- Consult a trusted physician for activities that suit your health condition.Even smaller amounts of activity can help you be more physically fit, as long as your workout “makes you breathe heavily.” (Related: If you have an 8-hour desk job, exercise for 30 minutes daily to significantly improve your health. 

- Moholdt recommends any exercise that you might enjoy, such as:Using the stairs at work instead of the elevator.Walking instead of driving to your destination.Getting off the bus one stop early and walking the rest of the way.Exercise during work breaks. 

- Starting exercise sooner ensures that you also see positive results sooner.Moholdt concluded that you should start and maintain good exercise habits as early as you can. 

- Being physically active doesn’t just help prevent premature death, it also helps improve your mental and physical health. 

- "Improving U.S. health and longevity requires changing many of those policies," said Montez. 

- "On the contrary: policymakers in many states have put the interests of corporations and their lobbyists--particularly the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)--and wealthy donors over the interests and health of their constituents. 

- These antibodies, or immunoglobulins, can bind to harmful foreign particles (such as viruses or disease-causing bacteria) to stop them invading and infecting the body's cells. 

- "Meta-analysis finds higher circulating vitamin D levels associated with lower risk of gestational diabetesAhvaz Jundishapur University (Iran), August 5, 2020According to news reporting out of Ahvaz, Iran, by NewsRx editors, research stated, “Several meta-analyses of observational studies revealed a modest increase in the risk of gestational diabetes (GDM) among pregnant women with low levels of serum vitamin D. However, no study examined a dose-response meta-analysis as well as a high versus low analysis in this regard.”Financial support for this research came from Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences.Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, “We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus up to August 2019 to find prospective observational studies investigating the association of serum 25(OH)D with the risk of developing GDM. 

- Considering linear analysis, each 10 nmol/L increase in circulating 25(OH)D was associated with a 2% lower risk of GDM (effect size (ES): 0.98; 95% CI: 0.98, 0.99; I=85.0%, p

- In Japan, in particular, it is used to help people relax, prevent obesity and treat certain skin conditions.In a recent study published in the Journal of Functional Foods, Japanese researchers find evidence of the mental health benefits offered by matcha.“The results of our study show that matcha, which has been used as a medicinal agent for many years, may be quite beneficial to the human body,” said Yuki Kurauchi, one of the study authors.For their study, the researchers looked at the effects of matcha tea powder on mice using an anxiety test for rodents called the elevated plus maze test. 

- According to studies, these receptors play a significant role in mediating anxiety.The team concluded that while more study is needed, their findings emphasize matcha’s beneficial effects on mental health.The effect of reiki and guided imagery intervention on pain and fatigue in oncology patientsSiirt University (Turkey),  31 July 2020.AbsractThis study was conducted to investigate the effects of Reiki and guided imagery on pain and fatigue in oncology patients. 

- It has anticonvulsant, anti-depressant and anti-inflammatory properties that make it suitable for treating a host of medical conditions, including epileptic seizures.But while its health benefits have been extensively studied, the precise mechanism behind cilantro’s powerful effects on the body remains obscure. 

- The present study provides a molecular basis for the therapeutic actions of cilantro.Cilantro activates neuronal potassium channels to alleviate seizuresThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 3.4 million Americans are living with epilepsy. 

- According to previous studies, KCNQ dysfunction can lead to severe, treatment-resistant epileptic seizures.The researchers also found that (E)-2-dodecenal could delay chemically-induced seizures, suggesting its involvement in cilantro’s anti-convulsant activity. 

- Geoffrey Abbott, one of the study authors, explained that by binding to a specific part of the potassium channels to open them, (E)-2-dodecenal was able to reduce cellular excitability.Given these findings, the researchers are optimistic that more effective strategies involving cilantro can be developed for the treatment of epilepsy.Cannabinoids may affect activity of other pharmaceuticalsPenn State University, August 3, 2020Cannabinoid-containing products may alter the effects of some prescription drugs, according to Penn State College of Medicine researchers. 

- They published information that could help medical professionals make safe prescribing choices for their patients who use prescription, over-the-counter or illicit cannabinoid products.Kent Vrana, professor and chair of pharmacology at the College of Medicine, and Paul Kocis, a pharmacist at Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, compiled a list of 57 medications that may not function as intended when used with medical cannabinoids, CBD oil (hemp oil) and medical or recreational marijuana. 

- The list was published in the journal Medical Cannabis and Cannabinoids.The medications on the list have a narrow therapeutic index, meaning they are prescribed at specific doses - enough to be effective, but not enough to cause harm. 

- Vrana says it's important for medical professionals to consider the list when prescribing medical cannabinoids and how it may affect other medications a patient is taking.To develop the list, the researchers looked at the prescribing information for four prescription cannabinoid medications. 

- Often prescribed for patients with atrial fibrillation or following cardiac valve replacement, the drug has a narrow therapeutic index, and Vrana cautions that medical professionals consider this potential drug-drug interaction both when prescribing warfarin to patients on prescription cannabinoids or prescribing cannabinoids to a patient taking warfarin.The researchers say that medical professionals should also consider patient use of CBD oil products and medical and recreational marijuana when using or prescribing drugs on the identified list. 

- "Unregulated products often contain the same active ingredients as medical cannabinoids, though they may be present in different concentrations," Vrana said. 

- "The drug-drug interaction information from medical cannabinoids may be useful as medical professionals consider the potential impact of over-the-counter or illicit cannabinoid products. 

- "Vrana advises that patients be honest with their health care providers about their use of cannabinoid products - from over-the-counter products to recreational marijuana. 

- Vrana and Kocis plan to routinely update this drug-drug interaction list as newer medications are approved and real-world evidence accumulates.Kent Vrana received a sponsored research agreement from PA Options for Wellness, a medical cannabis provider and clinical registrant in Pennsylvania, and this research was supported in part by the agreement. 

- The College of Medicine and PA Options for Wellness have a 10-year research agreement designed to help physicians and patients make better informed clinical decisions related to cannabinoids.Perinatal DHA supplementation improves cognition and alters brain functional organization in experimental researchUniversity of Georgia, July 31, 2020According to news reporting out of the University of Georgia, research stated, “Epidemiologic studies associate maternal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/DHA-containing seafood intake with enhanced cognitive development; although, it should be noted that interventional trials show inconsistent findings.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of Georgia: “We examined perinatal DHA supplementation on cognitive performance, brain anatomical and functional organization, and the brain monoamine neurotransmitter status of offspring using a piglet model. 

- "Results showed lower cognitive functioning in baby boomers was linked to less wealth, along with higher levels of loneliness, depression, inactivity and obesity, and less likelihood of being married.The study was published online recently in the Journals of Gerontology: Social Sciences.Zheng analyzed data on 30,191 Americans who participated in the 1996 to 2014 Health and Retirement Survey, conducted by the University of Michigan. 

- Zheng looked for clues across the lifetimes of those in the study.Increasing cognition scores in previous generations could be tied to beneficial childhood conditions - conditions that were similar for baby boomers, Zheng said.Baby boomers' childhood health was as good as or better than previous generations and they came from families that had higher socioeconomic status. 

- "The decline in cognitive functioning that we're seeing does not come from poorer childhood conditions," Zheng said.The biggest factors linked to lower cognition scores among baby boomers in the study were lower wealth, higher levels of self-reported loneliness and depression, lack of physical activity and obesity.Living without a spouse, being married more than once in their lives, having psychiatric problems and cardiovascular risk factors including strokes, hypertension, heart disease and diabetes were also associated with lower cognitive functioning among people in this generation. 

- "If it weren't for their better childhood health, move favorable family background, more years of education and higher likelihood of having a white-collar occupation, baby boomers would have even worse cognitive functioning," Zheng said.There were not enough late baby boomers (born in 1960 or later) to include in this study, but Zheng said he believes they will fare no better. 

- One example would be the lack of universal access and high cost of health care. 

- "Study: Experiencing childhood trauma makes body and brain age fasterFindings could help explain why children who suffer trauma often face poor health later in lifeHarvard University, August 2, 2020Children who suffer trauma from abuse or violence early in life show biological signs of aging faster than children who have never experienced adversity, according to research published by the American Psychological Association. 

- "Exposure to adversity in childhood is a powerful predictor of health outcomes later in life--not only mental health outcomes like depression and anxiety, but also physical health outcomes like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer," said Katie McLaughlin, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Harvard University and senior author of the study published in the journal Psychological Bulletin. 

- But these once-useful adaptations may have grave health and mental health consequences in adulthood.The new research underscores the need for early interventions to help avoid those consequences. 

- "The fact that we see such consistent evidence for faster aging at such a young age suggests that the biological mechanisms that contribute to health disparities are set in motion very early in life. 

- This means that efforts to prevent these health disparities must also begin during childhood," McLaughlin said.There are numerous evidence-based treatments that can improve mental health in children who have experienced trauma, McLaughlin said. 

- If this is possible, we may be able to prevent many of the long-term health consequences of early-life adversity," she says.

- The most effective program led to improvements in six areas, including depression and social connectedness.The researchers, who reported findings in the July 15 edition of Frontiers in Psychiatry, said such resiliency training programs could be a valuable tool for addressing the mental health crisis on university campuses. 

- "Student mental health has been on the decline over the last 10 years, and with the pandemic and racial tensions, things have only gotten worse. 

- Following the SKY sessions, students reported improvements in six areas of well-being: depression, stress, mental health, mindfulness, positive affect, and social connectedness.A second program called Foundations of Emotional Intelligence, developed by the YCEI, resulted in one improvement: greater mindfulness—the ability for students to be present and enjoy the moment.A third program called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, which relies heavily on mindfulness techniques, resulted in no reported improvements.In all, 135 Yale undergraduate students participated in the study.Across college campuses, there has been a significant rise in student depression, anxiety, and demand for mental health services. 

- From 2009 to 2014, students seeking treatment from campus counseling centers rose by 30%, though enrollment increased by just 6% on average. 

- "Students learn tools they can use for the rest of their lives to continue to improve and maintain their mental health," said co-first author Christina Bradley '16 B.S., currently a Ph.D. student at University of Michigan.Researchers administered the training sessions in person, but the courses can also be taken remotely.

- "Many reports, anecdotal and to some extent research-based, are now greatly strengthened by this more penetrating study," said Thoru Pederson, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal.Medieval medicine remedy could provide new treatment for modern day infectionsUniversity of Warwick UK, July 28, 2020Antibiotic resistance is an increasing battle for scientists to overcome, as more antimicrobials are urgently needed to treat biofilm-associated infections. 

- Biofilm helps protect bacteria from antibiotics, making them much harder to treat, one such biofilm that is particularly hard to treat is those that infect diabetic foot ulcers.Researchers at the University of Warwick, Dr Freya Harrison, Jessica Furner-Pardoe, and Dr Blessing Anonye, have looked at natural remedies for the gap in the antibiotic market, and in the paper, 'Anti-biofilm efficacy of a medieval treatment for bacterial infection requires the combination of multiple ingredients' published in the journal Scientific Reports today the 28 July, researchers say medieval methods using natural antimicrobials from every day ingredients could help find new answers.The Ancientbiotics research team was established in 2015 and is an interdisciplinary group of researchers including microbiologists, chemists, pharmacists, data analysts and medievalists at Warwick, Nottingham and in the United States.Building on previous research done by the University of Nottingham on using medieval remedies to treat MRSA, the researchers from the School of Life Sciences at University of Warwick reconstructed a 1,000-year-old medieval remedy containing onion, garlic, wine, and bile salts, which is known as 'Bald's eyesalve', and showed it to have promising antibacterial activity. 

- Streptococcus pyogenes - causes numerous infections in humans including pharyngitis, tonsillitis, scarlet fever, cellulitis, rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.All of these bacteria can be found in the biofilms that infect diabetic foot ulcers and which can be resistant to antibiotic treatment. 

- Because the mixture did not cause much damage to human cells in the lab, or to mice, we could potentially develop a safe and effective antibacterial treatment from the remedy. 

- "Jessica Furner-Pardoe, from the Medical School at the University of Warwick comments:"Our work demonstrates just how important it is to use realistic models in the lab when looking for new antibiotics from plants. 

- The Leechbook is widely thought of as one of the earliest known medical textbooks and contains Anglo-Saxon medical advice and recipes for medicines, salves and treatments. 

- Christina adds: "Bald's eyesalve underlines the significance of medical treatment throughout the ages. 

- "First clinical trial of its kind studies whether cannabidiol could help treat cannabis use disorder, compared to placeboUniversity of Bath (UK), July 28, 2020Prescription medication of cannabis extract cannabidiol, or CBD, is safe for daily use in treating cannabis use disorder, and could help people to cut down on cannabis use, according to an initial randomised controlled trial published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal.The study is the first to report that daily prescribed medical-use CBD use can cause reduction in cannabis use among people with cannabis use disorder, but the four-week study was not designed to provide robust estimates of the magnitude or duration of efficacy and further studies are needed.Researchers found an optimal daily dose of between 400mg and 800mg of CBD, which is considerably higher than concentrations found in CBD products that are available without prescription (which typically contain around 25mg CBD). 

- They warn that such products should not be used for medicinal purposes.The authors say that these findings are important in light of major policy changes surrounding the production and sale of cannabis products, increases in the number of people entering treatment for cannabis use disorders worldwide, and the current absence of recommended treatments for cannabis use disorder.Dr Tom Freeman, the study's lead author and Director of the Addiction and Mental Health Group at the University of Bath, UK, said: "Our study provides the first causal evidence to support cannabidiol, or CBD, as a treatment for cannabis use disorders. 

- However, there are currently no medications recommended for the treatment of cannabis use disorders.Cannabidiol, also known as CBD, is one of more than 80 chemicals present in cannabis. 

- However, it hasn't been possible to determine whether these effects were due to CBD, because the studies either used an open-label design (where the participants knew what medications they were taking and so the results could have been biased), or CBD was given together with THC so it wasn't possible to say to which chemical the effects were attributable.In this latest study, researchers carried out the first randomised clinical trial of cannabidiol for the treatment of cannabis addiction. 

- They had all expressed a desire to quit within the next month, and had tried to quit on at least one occasion before.Participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups and asked to take two capsules of CBD twice daily for four weeks. 

- 77 of 82 participants completed the treatment and those who dropped out did so because of missing study visits, being lost to follow up, not taking the study medication, or taking additional medications, and not because of the CBD treatment. 

- [1]The study was carried out over a four week treatment period with follow up extending to six months. 

- The researchers say additional research is needed to investigate the extent to which their findings translate to different durations of treatment. 

- Studies are also needed to investigate whether CBD directly reduces cannabis use or if it reduces other mental health symptoms which might indirectly affect cannabis use, such as anxiety.Pessimistic outlook on life linked to life expectancyQIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute (Australia). 

- July 28, 2020A new QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute study has found people who are strongly pessimistic about the future are at greater risk of dying earlier than those who are not pessimists.The researchers also found, however, that being an optimist did not extend life expectancy.The lead researcher, Dr. John Whitfield from QIMR Berghofer's Genetic Epidemiology group, said study participants who scored higher on pessimism in a questionnaire were likely to die on average two years earlier than those with low scores. 

- "The researchers used data collected from almost 3,000 participants who completed the Life Orientation Test as part of a broader questionnaire that looked at the health of Australians aged over 50 between 1993 and 1995.The participants were invited to agree or disagree with a number of statements including positive statements such as, 'I'm always optimistic about my future' or negative statements such as, 'If something can go wrong for me, it will'.The participants' details were then cross checked with the Australian National Death Index in October 2017 to find out how many people had died and their cause of death. 

- )Previous studies have shown a correlation between optimism and pessimism and specific diseases such as cardiovascular disease or stroke, but most previous studies also put optimism and pessimism on one scale.This resulted in people who received low scores on the pessimism questions being classed as optimists, but Dr. Whitfield said that was not always an accurate reflection of people's outlooks. 

- "We think it's unlikely that the disease caused the pessimism because we did not find that people who died from cancer had registered a strong pessimism score in their tests. 

- If illness was leading to higher pessimism scores, it should have applied to cancers as well as to cardiovascular disease."Dr. 

- Whitfield said the research findings raised questions about the practical health benefits of training people out of pessimism. 

- "Understanding that our long term health can be influenced by whether we're a cup-half-full or cup-half-empty kind of person might be the prompt we need to try to change the way we face the world, and try to reduce negativity, even in really difficult circumstances. 

- Of those, 4.9 million were due to ischaemic heart disease and 3.5 million were due to stroke.Japan alone has more than 10 million people with high blood pressure, and the number continues to rise. 

- Dr. Yanagiya said: "High blood pressure is a lifestyle-related disease. 

- This applies to men of all ages, who can greatly decrease their chance of a heart attack or stroke by improving their health behaviours."Dr. 

- Yusuke Yoshikawa, public relations coordinator for JCS 2020, said: "Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors of cardiovascular disease in Japan, because the average daily salt intake in Japan (approx. 

- As the current guidelines2 strongly recommend healthy lifestyle to control high blood pressure, this study suggests a potential key to successful intervention for those who are at risk of heart disease and stroke. 

- "Acute exercise has beneficial effects on the immune system during prostate cancerVictoria University (Australia), July 28, 2020New research published this week in Experimental Physiology found that in prostate cancer survivors, a moderate bout of exercise kept the cell count of certain type of immune cells at a normal level, suggesting the exercise is safe for prostate cancer survivors. 

- Exercise is recommended for cancer survivors to reduce the side effects of treatment and has shown to have many benefits.However, the effects of prostate cancer treatment and acute exercise on the immune system have only been briefly examined. 

- Exercise oncology guidelines were initially based on the responses seen in healthy, older adults. 

- But individuals with cancer have different physiological responses to exercise, many of which we are only just beginning to understand.Exercise helps the immune system mobilise by causing NK cells to move into the blood and be transported them to areas of need, such as sites of infection or tumours. 

- This has been shown very elegantly in animal models but the exercise and immune response in cancer survivors is limited, with only a few studies in prostate cancer.The researchers, based at Victoria University in Australia, had volunteers (11 cancer survivors currently receiving ADT treatment, and 14 men with prostate cancer not on ADT, and 8 healthy controls) completed a cycling task to determine their maximal aerobic fitness.The researchers chose to use a moderate intensity exercise session that was consistent with current exercise oncology guidelines but was also a bout that would be practical for prostate cancer survivors to perform on their own.To ensure that the exercise bout used to stimulate the immune system was the same degree of difficulty for everyone, they standardised based on their maximal effort.To determine immune function, they obtained blood samples before exercise, immediately after and 2h after they finished cycling. 

- The participants then came back the next day (24h) after exercise, and immune function was assessed again after one night of recovery. 

- They also measured several key hormone levels, including adrenaline and noradrenaline, as they play a role in activating and mobilising the NK immune cells.The researchers found that 24 hours after a moderate bout of cycling, the immune cell count of natural killer (NK) cells, part of the body's first line of defence, had returned to resting levels.They also showed that the immune cell mobilisation with exercise does not appear to be significantly altered during prostate cancer treatment, which provides direct evidence that acute exercise that falls within current oncology guidelines also appears to be beneficial for the immune system.A limitation of the study is the modest sample size, and also that they examined cytokines and proteins that are related to NK cell function but did not directly assess the killing capacity of the NK cells.Erik D Hanson, first author on the study said,"One of the most enjoyable aspects of working with these men is how willing these men are to help their fellow prostate cancer survivors. 

- "Study shows mango consumption has positive impact on inflammatory bowel diseaseTexas A&M University, July 29, 2020Initial results of a study by researchers in the department of nutrition and food science at Texas A&M University in College Station show mango consumption has a positive impact on people with inflammatory bowel disease.Dr. 

- Susanne Talcott, Texas A&M AgriLife Research scientist, and others recently investigated the use of fresh mangoes as an adjuvant to conventional therapy in mild to moderate inflammatory bowel disease. 

- "Inflammatory bowel disease presents a major risk factor for colon cancer with the most common forms of this disorder being Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis," Talcott said. 

- ""Colorectal cancer can develop from precursor lesions that can be caused by inflammatory bowel disease over periods of 10 to 15 years, which provides an extended time for preventive measures," she said.Talcott said multiple studies have demonstrated the health benefits of secondary plant compounds in fruits and vegetables including pomegranate, citrus and curcuminoids, and polyphenolics have been found to reduce inflammatory processes in chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases. 

- "However, few human clinical studies using polyphenolics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease have been conducted," she said.Mangos are rich in gallotannins, a group of large molecular polyphenols that can be broken down to small, absorbable, bioactive molecules by certain intestinal bacteria.To investigate the impact of mango polyphenolics on humans, Talcott's team, which included husband Dr. Stephen Alcott, also an AgriLife Research scientist, designed a clinical trial conducted at Texas A&M. 

- Trial subjects were recruited in the College Station area and at the Ertan Digestive Disease Center at the Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston under the direction of Dr. Andrew Dupont, MD.The study was designed as a controlled clinical pilot trial in subjects with mild-to-moderate active Crohn's disease or mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. 

- Subjects ate mango as an adjunct to their common drug treatment for mild-to-moderate IBD.Male and female individuals from 18 to 79 years old with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were enrolled in the study. 

- Those included were individuals undergoing current or previous IBD drug treatment within the past six months and those on a stable drug regimen for at least three weeks before the start of the treatment phase of the study.Excluded from the study were those with chronic health conditions or recurrent hospitalizations, as well as those who smoked more than one pack of cigarettes per week, had a current liver or renal dysfunction, were pregnant or lactating or had a known lactose intolerance, gluten sensitivity or celiac disease. 

- Also excluded were those with planned or scheduled IBD-related surgery, current IBD-related intestinal stricture, current infection with C. difficile or a previous bowel resection.Medical personnel evaluated more than 300 subjects for the study based on medical records or surveys. 

- Subjects who underwent an endoscopy before the beginning of this study were asked to wait at least one week before the study treatment could be started. 

- The treatment phase of the study was eight weeks. 

- "All subjects who completed the study stated they would continue to consume mangoes regularly and will recommend this to others who suffer from IBD and also tell their physicians," Talcott said.She said if mango or any other polyphenolic-rich food can be identified as helpful in shortening or reducing severity of episodes of inflammatory bowel disease, the addition of mango polyphenolics to conventional IBD drug treatment could have a significant positive impact on public health.Meta-analysis supports potential of omega-3s for ADHDKings College London, July 28, 2020Omega-3s fatty acid supplements may improve symptoms and cognitive performance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), according to a meta-analysis of gold standard clinical trials.Data from seven clinical trials involving over 500 children and adolescents indicated that omega-3s were associated with improvements in clinical symptoms of ADHD, while data from three clinical trials involving over 200 children and adolescents indicated a positive impact on cognitive measures associated with attention.“[W]e provide strong evidence supporting a role for n3-PUFAs deficiency in ADHD, and for advocating n-3 PUFAs supplementation as a clinically relevant intervention in this group, especially if guided by a biomarker-based personalization approach,” wrote the authors, led by Jane Pei-Chen Chang from King’s College London, in Neuropsychopharmacology .Boosting EPA/DHA intakesCommenting independently on the meta-analysis, Harry Rice, PhD, VP of regulatory & scientific affairs for the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s (GOED): “In the past, I've been lukewarm on whether or not increasing EPA/DHA intake benefits children with ADHD. 

- “However, we have [previously] shown that individuals at genetic risk of developing depression in the context of the immune challenge, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), have lower levels of RBCs n3-PUFAs, and that n-3 PUFAs supplementation prevents the onset of IFN-alpha-induced depression, arguably by replenishing the endogenously low anti-inflammatory PUFAs in the ‘at risk’ individuals.”
Consuming alliums like onions and garlic found to lower colorectal cancer risk by 79 percentChina Medical University, July 24, 2020In a recent study published in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology, Chinese researchers found that eating high amounts of allium vegetables corresponded to a 79 percent reduction in colorectal cancer risk.According to senior author Zhi Li from The First Hospital of China Medical University, their findings highlight a trend: The greater the amount of alliums consumed, the better the protection against colorectal cancer.Higher allium consumption linked to a reduced risk of colorectal cancerFor their research, the team compared the food intake of 833 colorectal cancer patients to that of 833 healthy participants (controls) who matched them in terms of age, sex and area of residence. 

- Li said that their findings shed light on the role of lifestyle intervention in the prevention of colorectal cancer.However, Mary Flynn, an associate professor of medicine at Brown University in Rhode Island, noted that although these findings are interesting, it bears stressing that the colorectal cancer patients had a greater family history of the disease than the controls.The colorectal cancer patients also smoked more and reported consuming less fruits, more alcohol and almost double the amount of red meat than the controls. 

- Among other risk factors, more and more studies point to diet as a major factor in the development of prostate cancer, as it is for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. 

- The study did not show any clear link between a Western diet with salt and alcohol and the risk of developing the disease.Moving away from the typical approach used in epidemiological studies, which involves looking at one nutrient or food group at a time, the researchers collected data from a broader dietary profile. 

- Calcium is often found in dairy products, which also contain vitamin D. Our more targeted approach takes this synergy into account to produce more meaningful results that public health authorities can use to formulate recommendations. 

- In particular, the pronounced impact of vitamin D metabolites on the immune system response, and on the development of COVID-19 infection by the novel SARS CoV-2 virus, has been previously described in a few studies worldwide.The collaborative group of scientists from the Leumit Health Services (LHS) and the Azrieli Faculty of Medicine of Bar-Ilan University aimed to determine associations of low plasma 25(OH)D with the risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. 

- "Surprisingly, chronic medical conditions, like dementia, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease that were considered to be very risky in previous studies, were not found as increasing the rate of infection in our study," noted Prof. Shlomo Vinker, LHS Chief Medical Officer. 

- Therefore, we assume that following the Israeli Ministry of Health instructions, patients with chronic medical conditions significantly reduced their social contacts. 

- Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the rates of changes during the treatment period. 

- During the 24-week treatment period, mean BCVA significantly improved at 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2-0.6, P< 0.001), 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3-0.7, P< 0.001), and 0.2 (95% CI: 0.02-0.4, P = 0.03) letters/month in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 

- Their findings lead them to recommend parents follow World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which advise limiting a child’s screen time to one hour per day. 

- This can lead to a variety of health problems, including high risk of obesity and lower mental development.Until this report, researchers say most studies focus on school-aged children and adolescents, producing mixed results.“We sought to determine whether screen viewing habits at age two to three affected how children spent their time at age five. 

- Those youths are getting about 30 minutes less light activity each day and 10 minutes less vigorous exercise as well.“Our findings support public health efforts to reduce screen viewing time in young children,” Bozhi Chen from the National University of Singapore says.Sleep habits do not seem to be heavily affected by too much screen usage.Room for improvementResearchers note the results also need to take into account biases by the parents. 

- Dorothea Dumuid of the University of South Australia, who is not a part of the study, argues the findings aren’t enough to definitively link screen time with reduced physical activity.“In this rapidly evolving digital age, children’s screen use is a key concern for parents and medical bodies. 

- “Future research is needed to assess the influence of media content, to determine optimum durations of screen time.”Chen and the team from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health say more studies are necessary to determine the long-term health effects of the growing digital influence on kids.Research shows Mexican walnut can protect the kidneys from ischemic injuryUniversidad Autónoma de Nuevo León School of Medicine (Mexico), July 24, 2020Some species from the genus Juglans – the largest and most widely distributed of the eight genera in the walnut family – have diverse biological activities, such as anti-hypertensive, antioxidant, lipolytic (fat-metabolizing), anti-hyperglycemic, anti-lipidemic and anti-proliferative properties. 

- Studies suggest that these activities may be useful in the treatment of a wide variety of ailments, ranging from minor complaints like diarrhea and stomach pain to more serious conditions like arthritis, diabetes and cancer.Juglans mollis, commonly known as Mexican walnut, is traditionally used to make medicine in northeastern Mexico. 

- This activity may be attributed to the plant’s ability to decrease inflammation and modulate oxidative stress markers (SOD and MDA).Magnesium-Rich Foods and Why You Need ThemGreenMedInfo, July 23, 2020You may have a low level of magnesium in your diet that is preventing you from reaping important health benefitsMagnesium (Mg) is considered a healthy mineral essential to your body, but it is estimated that 75% of Americans and people around the world are well below the recommended daily intake of Mg.[i] Luckily, there is an easy fix, since magnesium is bountiful in many foods.Bright leafy greens/veggies (magnesium gives them that rich green color) top the magnesium-dense list including spinach, chard, broccoli and kale, followed closely by legumes such as lima beans, black beans, peas and edamame (soybean). 

- Magnesium has neuroprotective, cardio-protective, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity and hypoglycemic properties.A magnesium deficiency or low level of magnesium in your food creates an out of balance condition in your body linked to many diseases from diabetes, heart disease and metabolic syndrome to depression and neurological disorders.DiabetesMagnesium has many protective properties, such as glucose or blood sugar moderating and insulin regulating, lowering risk for Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and improving outcomes for Type 1 diabetes (T1D).Magnesium intake significantly improved glucose parameters in people with diabetes and also improved insulin-sensitivity parameters in those at high risk of diabetes in a review of 18 randomized clinical trials, including a total of 670 diabetic and 453 at risk for diabetes patients. 

- [xiii]In a meta-analysis of 532,979 participants from 19 studies, the greatest risk reduction for cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurred when magnesium intake increased from 150 to 400 milligrams (mg) per day. 

- [xiv] In a meta-analysis of 48 genetic studies with a total of 60,801 coronary artery disease (CAD) cases and 123,504 non-cases, researchers found that serum magnesium levels are inversely associated with risk of heart disease. 

- [xv]Magnesium supplementation is also seen as a successful preventative mechanism (by improving lipid profiles, fasting glucose and blood pressure)[xvi] to heart disease complications (a leading cause of death from T2 diabetes).

- These findings indicate that persimmon and blueberry waste powders could be included in food formulations to boost the content of carotenoids and anthocyanins, which could have a positive impact on human health, the researchers say.Plant-based diets shown to lower blood pressure even with limited meat and dairyConsuming a plant-based diet can lower blood pressure even if small amounts of meat and dairy are consumed too, according to new researchUniversity of Warwick (UK), July 27, 2020Consuming a plant-based diet can lower blood pressure even if small amounts of meat and dairy are consumed too, according to new research from the University of Warwick.Published online by a team from Warwick Medical School in the Journal of Hypertension today (25 July), they argue that any effort to increase plant-based foods in your diet and limit animal products is likely to benefit your blood pressure and reduce your risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular disease. 

- A reduction in blood pressure has important health benefits both for individuals and for populations. 

- "Senior author Professor Francesco Cappuccio of Warwick Medical School said: "The adoption of plant-based dietary patterns would also play a role in global food sustainability and security. 

- For example, for an individual, the ability to adopt a plant-based diet would be influenced by socio-economic factors (costs, availability, access), perceived benefits and difficulties, resistance to change, age, health status, low adherence due to palatability and acceptance. 

- "To overcome these barriers, we ought to formulate strategies to influence beliefs about plant-based diets, plant food availability and costs, multisectoral actions to foster policy changes focusing on environmental sustainability of food production, science gathering and health consequences. 

- "Health and happiness depend on each otherGeorgetown University, July 22, 2020Good health and a happy outlook on life may seem like equally worthy yet independent goals. 

- A growing body of research, however, bolsters the case that a happy outlook can have a very real impact on your physical well-being.New research published in the journal Psychological Science shows that both online and in-person psychological interventions -- tactics specifically designed to boost subjective well-being -- have positive effects on self-reported physical health. 

- "Though prior studies have shown that happier people tend to have better cardiovascular health and immune-system responses than their less happy counterparts," said Kostadin Kushlev, a professor in Georgetown University's Department of Psychology and one of the authors of the paper, "our research is one of the first randomized controlled trials to suggest that increasing the psychological well-being even of generally healthy adults can have benefits to their physical health. 

- "Intervention for Healthy OutcomesOver the course of six months, Kushlev and his colleagues at the University of Virginia and the University of British Columbia examined how improving the subjective well-being of people who were not hospitalized or otherwise undergoing medical treatment affected their physical health.A group of 155 adults between the ages of 25 and 75 were randomly assigned either to a wait-list control condition or a 12-week positive psychological intervention that addressed three different sources of happiness: the "Core Self," the "Experiential Self," and the "Social Self. 

- None of the modules focused on promoting physical health or health behaviors, such as sleep, exercise, or diet.Each module featured an hour-long lesson with information and exercises; a weekly writing assignment, such as journaling; and an active behavioral component, such as guided meditation. 

- Three months after the conclusion of the trial, researchers followed up with the participants to evaluate their well-being and health.A Happy FutureParticipants who received the intervention reported increasing levels of subjective well-being over the course of the 12-week program. 

- "These results speak to the potential of such interventions to be scaled in ways that reach more people in environments such as college campuses to help increase happiness and promote better mental health among students," Kushlev said.Rely on gut feeling? 

- "There is significant interest in how the gut communicates with the brain as a major unresolved issue because of growing evidence that many diseases may first start in the gut and then travel to the brain, an example of which is Parkinson's Disease," says Professor Spencer. 

- "The results reveal why the ENS might play an increasingly important part on human health, and could shed light on potential new treatments for conditions like Parkinson's disease.This study represents a big step towards understanding ENS functions and the complexity of the gut and brain connection through the neurons that allow communication in the body.Professor Spencer says there is increasing interest in understanding how the nervous system in the gut (ENS) communicates with the brain, to give us all those sensations we know of. 

- Understanding how the gut communicates and controls other organs in the body can lead to important breakthroughs for disease treatment and this is an important step in the right direction. 

- Their review was published in the journal Food Science and Human Wellness.Functional foods, which could be either natural or processed foods that contain bioactive compounds, can provide health-promoting effects beyond basic nutrition.These foods also offer the benefit of preventing or treating chronic diseases.The bioactive components in functional foods often have pleiotropic effects, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic (cholesterol-lowering), blood sugar-regulating, cytoprotective and neuroprotective functions.Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process used by the body to eliminate aberrant components in eukaryotic cells.It also plays an essential role in promoting health and preventing or treating several chronic diseases.When cells are in a stressful condition, autophagy accelerates the clearance of damaged or toxic cellular protein aggregates or dysfunctional cell organelles to maintain homeostasis.In this review, the researchers focused on several bioactive components of functional foods, such as resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin and trehalose, and their regulatory functions in autophagy. 

- They believe this review could serve as a reference or provide novel ideas for the development of functional foods capable of modulating autophagy for the treatment of chronic diseases.Combination of vitamin E and Lactobacillius plantarum reverses mercuric chloride-induced neurotoxicityKing Saud University, July 23, 2020According to news originating from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, “Mercury is the third most hazardous heavy metal and its toxicity causes a severe health risk through unfavorable detrimental pathological and biochemical effects.

- The patients' health care teams tracked their blood sugar control, heart disease risk factors, and other health measurements before and after the diet change.One case study followed a female patient who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2018. 

- "The patient in this case study experienced the opposite: Adding more healthful carbohydrates to her diet stabilized her glycemic control, reduced her insulin needs, and boosted her overall health. 

- Now, these groundbreaking case studies are offering hope that the same may be true for those with type 1 diabetes," adds Dr. Kahleova.Raised iron levels linked to reduced life expectancyImperial College London, July 24, 2020Having too much iron in the body puts your long term health at risk but it could also take years off your life.These are the findings of a study using large scale genetic data to assess the impacts across a population of having naturally raised levels of iron, in terms of years of life expectancy.According to the researchers, the findings—which help to cut through the noise caused by confounding factors such as age, sex or diet—add to the increasingly complex picture of iron's role in our health and highlight the risks of having raised levels of iron.Dr. 

- Dipender Gill, from Imperial's School of Public Health and who supervised the study, said: "We have known for a long time that having too much or too little iron in your system can have serious impacts on your health, and that effectively modifying iron levels can help many people with underlying conditions. 

- While we did not look directly at the impact of taking supplements, our results suggest that there is a need to better understand the health implications of people boosting their iron levels with supplements when they don't need to. 

- Most people without underlying health conditions should be able to get enough iron from their diet. 

- But disrupting the balance can lead to a host of health implications: too little iron is associated with fatigue and impaired immune system, while too much can cause liver failure, and in high enough doses can even be fatal.A number of studies suggest small changes in iron levels can have protective and detrimental effects for different diseases, such as heart disease, stroke and infections. 

- But the net effect of varying iron levels on life expectancy remains unclear.In the latest study, published this month in the journal Clinical Nutrition, Dr. Gill and Mr. Iyas Daghlas from Harvard Medical School used a statistical technique called Mendelian randomization to try to explore the effect of increasing levels of iron on health—using people's genetic variation as an indicator of their iron levels.The researchers trawled genetic data from almost 49,000 people to find genetic variants linked to iron levels. 

- They focused on three points in the genome where a single "letter" difference in the DNA—called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)—can slightly increase or reduce a person's iron level.When these same SNPs were then screened in a larger dataset combing lifespan data for more than one million people, they found that the genetic markers for higher iron levels on average associated with reduced life expectancy.The analysis revealed that for every one point of standard deviation increase in genetically predicted serum iron above baseline, people had an estimated 0.7 fewer years of lifespan.Furthermore, the findings were unlikely to be biased by lifestyle factors.A body of workThe work builds on a number of previous studies by Dr. Gill, which have used genetic data to investigate the role of iron in hundreds of diseases.A 2017 study revealed the link between high iron levels and lower risk of heart disease. 

- Taken together, the studies build a complex picture of iron status in health.The authors stress that the genetic markers themselves do not indicate reduced life expectancy or risk in the wider context, but are a tool to study how iron levels relate to health without the influence of a number of complex confounding factors such as diet, economic background, or smoking status. 

- But the clinical implications warrant further investigation and could be important for long-term health at the population level. 

- "Mr Iyas Daghlas, from Harvard Medical School, said: "These findings should not yet be extrapolated to clinical practice, but they further support the idea that people without an iron deficiency are unlikely to benefit from supplementation, and that it may actually do them harm.

- "However, because it has public health concerns and has been implicated in a number of foodborne outbreaks, we wanted to look at the effects of green tea extract on norovirus. 

- Published in the journal Food & Nutrition, it demonstrated that drinking Montmorency tart cherry juice every day for 12 weeks improved cognitive function in adults aged 65 to 80.Tart cherry juice supplementation can improve cognitive performance in older adultsLead author Chai Sheau Ching and colleagues had previously observed the beneficial effects of tart cherry antioxidants, such as melanin, melatonin and anthocyanin, on high blood pressure and cholesterol.In particular, the team found that drinking juice made from Montmorency tart cherries, the most common cherries in the U.S., helped reduce systolic blood pressure, fight inflammation and neutralize the harmful effects of oxidative stress.Based on these earlier findings, the team speculated that the antioxidants in tart cherries could also exert neuroprotective effects on the brain and improve cognitive abilities in older adults.To test their hypothesis, the team asked 37 adults, aged between 65 and 80, to drink either 16 ounces of Montmorency tart cherry juice or a placebo drink of the same amount every day – one in the morning and one in the evening – for 12 weeks. 

- The team also asked the participants to maintain their diet and record their food consumption for the duration of the trial.None of the participants had prior diagnoses of medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer and neurological disorders at the time of the trial. 

- Chai hopes that future studies can shed more light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the cognitive-enhancing effects of Montmorency tart cherries.Cognitive health and agingCommenting on their findings, Chai noted that cognitive health plays a key role in determining the quality of life of older adults.According to recent reports by the World Health Organization, about 50 million people around the globe suffer from some form of dementia. 

- Despite the fact that dementia is not a natural part of aging, its symptoms, including forgetfulness and difficulty communicating, are usually felt later in life.Fortunately, an emerging body of evidence suggests that proper diet and nutrition can reduce the risk of dementia and neurodegenerative diseases in old age. 

- For instance, people can incorporate Montmorency tart cherry juice into a well-balanced diet to enhance their brain performance.Study suggests benefit for vitamin C in endometriosisZhejiang University (China), July 20, 2020According to news reporting originating in Hangzhou, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Endometriosis is a common disease in females that seriously affects quality of life. 

- The principal pathological process of endometriosis is pelvic inflammation, and local and peripheral fibrosis.”The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Zhejiang University, “Treatment of endometriosis requires both pharmacological and surgical approaches. 

- Vitamin C can reduce the volume of endometriotic lesions and inhibit fibrosis of lesions in rats.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “This study supports the use of vitamin C in the treatment of endometriosis.”Cannabis Appears Safe And Effective At Treating Chronic Pain, New Clinical Trial ShowsUniversity of California Irvine, July 21, 2020Cannabis appears to be a safe and potentially effective treatment for the chronic pain that afflicts people with sickle cell disease, according to a new clinical trial co-led by University of California, Irvine researcher Kalpna Gupta and Dr. Donald Abrams of UC San Francisco. 

- “They also suggest that sickle cell patients may be able to mitigate their pain with cannabis – and that cannabis might help society address the public health crisis related to opioids. 

- Of course, we still need larger studies with more participants to give us a better picture of how cannabis could benefit people with chronic pain.”Opioids are currently the primary treatment for the chronic and acute pain caused by sickle cell disease. 

- But the rise in opioid-associated deaths has prompted physicians to prescribe them less frequently, leaving sickle cell patients with fewer options.The double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was the first to employ such gold-standard methods to assess cannabis’s potential for pain alleviation in people with sickle cell disease. 

- The cannabis used in the trial was obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse – part of the National Institutes of Health – and contained equal parts of THC and CBD.“Pain causes many people to turn to cannabis and is, in fact, the top reason that people cite for seeking cannabis from dispensaries,” Gupta said. 

- This trial opens the door for testing different forms of medical cannabis to treat chronic pain.”Twenty-three patients with sickle cell disease-related pain completed the trial, inhaling vaporized cannabis or a vaporized placebo during two five-day inpatient sessions that were separated by at least 30 days. 

- This allowed them to act as their own control group.Researchers assessed participants’ pain levels throughout the treatment period and found that the effectiveness of cannabis appeared to increase over time. 

- Although pain levels were generally lower in patients given cannabis than in those given the placebo, the difference was not statistically significant.Bad eating habits may cause blindness, warn researchersUniversity of Bristol (UK), July 20, 2020There’s no denying that eating junk food is bad for your health, as it’s linked to obesity and an increased risk of various health problems. 

- It can cause obesity and increase your risk of developing heart disease and cancer. 

- Denize Atan, a senior lecturer in ophthalmology at Bristol Medical School and a co-author of the study, explained that eyeglasses wouldn’t help the patient’s vision since any damage to the optic nerve can’t be addressed with lenses. 

- To prevent his vision loss from worsening, physicians prescribed the teenager nutritional supplements.Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder and mental healthThe doctors involved in the patient’s case also referred him to mental health services for an eating disorder because there seemed to be more to his unusual diet. 

- This relatively new diagnosis, previously called “selective eating disorder,” may cause a lack of interest in food or avoidance of foods with certain colors, textures or other factors without links to the patient’s body weight or shape.Other symptoms of ARFID include:Abdominal pain, cold intolerance, constipation, lethargy or excess energyDramatic restriction in amount or types of food eatenDramatic weight lossEating only certain textures of foodEating a limited range of preferred foods that becomes narrower over time or picky eating that worsens with timeFears of choking or vomitingInconsistent and vague gastrointestinal issues, like an upset stomach, around mealtimes with no known causeNo body image disturbance or fear of weight gainARFID often manifests in childhood, and patients tend to have a normal body mass index (BMI) like the teenaged boy, concluded the study authors.Chronic inflammation alters the evolution of cells in the colon, study findsResearchers have compared diseased colon with healthy tissue to better understand how inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancersCambridge University and Wellcome Sanger Institute, July 21, 2020In a new study, researchers have compared diseased colon with healthy tissue to better understand how inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancers, at a molecular level. 

- The results provide valuable insights into evolution within the body, and the development of IBD and colorectal cancers.IBD primarily refers to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, chronic illnesses characterised by inflammation of the digestive system that can be highly disruptive to a patient's quality of life. 

- The causes of the disease remain unknown, though it is thought that inflammation occurs as a result of an inappropriate immune response to gut microbes.People suffering from IBD are at an increased risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers compared to the general population. 

- Patients will undergo regular surveillance for this and may, in some cases, opt to undergo surgery to remove their entire colon in order to mitigate this risk.In this new study, clinicians at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge provided colon tissue samples donated by 46 IBD patients, along with anonymised information about their medical history and treatment. 

- They were then compared to sequences from 412 crypts from 41 individuals without IBD, so that the effects of chronic inflammation on the DNA sequence could be observed.The team found that there were more than twice as many DNA changes in the diseased tissue than in normal, and the longer the duration of the disease, the greater this excess.The study also uncovered evidence of an evolutionary process whereby mutations in particular genes are under positive selection. 

- It has been fascinating to study the effect of a chronic disease on this process and uncover evidence that changes in the genetic sequence of gut cells could have a direct role in the onset of inflammatory bowel disease. 

- "Dr Tim Raine, clinical lead for the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) service at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge and Honorary Faculty member at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: "Colorectal cancer is one of the main clinical concerns when treating patients with IBD. 

- These approaches have given us unique insights into the effects of inflammatory bowel disease on the DNA sequence of the inflamed tissue. 

- These findings highlight genetic mutations as a possible explanation, with some positively-selected mutations in immune regulation genes occurring in the same regions of the bowel affected by chronic inflammation.Dr Carl Anderson, lead author of the study from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: "We know that DNA changes contribute to the development of cancer, but their role in common non-cancerous diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been extensively studied. 

- I strongly believe that studying somatic mutations in all common diseases, not just IBD and cancers, has the potential to provide novel insights into disease biology and highlight potential drug targets. 

- Endocrine therapy is frequently effective in these hormone-receptor-positive tumors, but the long-term benefits are often hindered by treatment resistance.Several clinical trials, including one at USC on breast cancer and prostate patients, are now investigating the effects of the fasting-mimicking diets in combination with different cancer-fighting drugs. 

- "I like to call it the nontoxic wildcard for cancer treatment," Longo said. 

- "Scientists identify 10 risk factors for Alzheimer diseaseFudan University (China), July 17, 2020Alzheimer’s disease may be preventable by keeping an eye on key factors including weight gain, blood pressure and avoiding stress, experts say.Researchers said many risk factors are modifiable in the fight to prevent dementia, which affects around 850,000 people in the UK, two-thirds of whom have Alzheimer’s.Their review of existing studies found 10 risk factors had strong evidence of a link with Alzheimer’s, and people could take action to avoid them.These included ensuring good education in early life, keeping the brain active through activities such as reading, and not being overweight or obese in later life.People should also avoid depression, stress, high blood pressure, head trauma and diabetes to reduce their risk, they said.Other factors had weaker links that could be adjusted, including not being obese in midlife, taking exercise, getting enough sleep, including vitamin C in the diet and not smoking.The study, published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry, was led by Professor Jin-Tai Yu at Fudan University in China.The researchers gathered 395 studies and came up with a list of factors that could be used by doctors to try to prevent Alzheimer’s disease.They said research into preventing dementia should continue but their report offered “clinicians and stakeholders an evidence-based guideline for Alzheimer’s disease prevention”.Fiona Carragher, director of research and influencing at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “In recent years, research has suggested that nearly a third of dementia cases may be preventable and this review builds on this idea, specifically in relation to Alzheimer’s disease and how certain risk factors, many of which are associated with cardiovascular health, may be within our control.“We need a deeper dive into each of these risk factors to understand how they work together on an individual level and how best to support people to manage them.“This review demonstrates that, while observational studies are useful to help identify potential risk factors, we need to see many more interventional trials to understand what the best approaches are to preventing Alzheimer’s disease developing in the first place.“We don’t have all the answers yet, but we do know that small steps to improving your physical and mental health can make a big difference, like walking to your local shop for milk instead of jumping in the car.”

- 2020Regular mushroom consumption can lead to a 17 lower risk of prostate cancer, according to a team of researchers from Tohoku University’s School of Public Health in Japan.Lead author and doctoral student Shu Zhang noted that the cancer-fighting effects of mushrooms appeared to be more significant in men aged 50 and older.That said, Zhang clarified that her team did not collect information on specific mushroom species and, as such, did not elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind the fungi’s cancer-fighting effects.Their findings have been published in the International Journal of Cancer.Habitual mushroom consumption linked to a reduced risk of prostate cancerTo see if mushrooms are potent against prostate cancer – the second most common cancer among older men – Zhang and her team looked at the data of 36,000 men between the ages of 40 and 79 for a median period of 13.2 years. 

- Each participant had been part of either the Miyagi Cohort Study in 1990 or the Ohsaki Cohort Study in 1994.Upon analysis of the pooled data from both cohorts, Zhang and her team found that 3.3 percent of the participants had incidents of prostate cancer based on responses from questionnaires regarding their medical histories and their eating, smoking and drinking habits.It also appeared that mushroom consumption is inversely related to incident prostate cancer. 

- At higher doses, the compound was also found to kill virus particles.Infection with TGEV causes a disease called transmissible gastroenteritis in piglets, which is characterised by diarrhoea, severe dehydration and death. 

- Traditional Chinese medicine and its active ingredients, are ideal screening libraries for antiviral drugs because of their advantages, such as convenient acquisition and low side effects.”The researchers now hope to continue their research in vivo, using an animal model to assess whether the inhibiting properties of curcumin would be seen in a more complex system.“Further studies will be required, to evaluate the inhibitory effect in vivo and explore the potential mechanisms of curcumin against TGEV, which will lay a foundation for the comprehensive understanding of the antiviral mechanisms and application of curcumin” said Dr Xie.Nitric oxide may slow progression of COVID-19A recent review published by GW researchers suggests that nitric oxide has promise as a therapeutic to control the replication and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2George Washington University, July 21, 2020Nitric oxide treatment can be pivotal in the world's fight against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, according to a review from the George Washington University (GW). 

- "Nitric oxide plays key roles in maintaining normal vascular function and regulating inflammatory cascades that contribute to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)," said Adam Friedman, MD, interim chair and professor in the Department of Dermatology at the GW School of Medicine and Health Sciences and co-senior author of the review. 

- "Interventions that are protective against ALI and ARDS can play a critical role for patients and health systems during the pandemic. 

- There is currently no registered treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. 

- The absence of a specific treatment and the high mortality rate of the virus dictate an urgent need for therapeutics that may control the replication and rapid spread of the virus.The team, led by first author Nagasai Adusumilli, MBA, a fourth-year medical student at the GW School of Medicine and Health Sciences, reviewed data from between 1993 and 2020 on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses and the use of nitric oxide as a treatment for respiratory illness. 

- The authors highlight the potential for inhaled nitric oxide contributing to better clinical outcomes and alleviating the rapidly rising strain on health care capacity due to COVID-19.As groups continue to publish more results with their respective nitric oxide platforms, the team recommends that dosing and protocol variations should be examined in evaluating the studies. 

- "With the emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic with the ability to overwhelm the body and our health care infrastructure, patients have a pressing need for effective agents that can slow the disease in their bodies and in their communities," Friedman said.The authors suggest that if nitric oxide's efficacy is illustrated for COVID-19, its use as a treatment can be pivotal in the fight against the pandemic.Friedman has been collaborating with co-senior author Joel Friedman, MD, PhD, professor of physiology and biophysics and of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, on research related to the use of nitric oxide in a broad range of medical indications for close to two decades, and together are developing nitric oxide-based therapeutics for COVID-19.Cinnamon may improve blood sugar control in people with prediabetesJoslin Diabetes Center (Boston), July 21, 2020Cinnamon improves blood sugar control in people with prediabetes and could slow the progression to type 2 diabetes, according to a new study published in the Journal of the Endocrine Society.It is estimated that nearly 90 million people in the United States have prediabetes, which occurs when blood sugar levels are higher than normal and often leads to type 2 diabetes. 

- Cinnamon was well tolerated and was not associated with specific side effects or adverse events.Supplements with potential to prevent Alzheimer's affect blood, but less so the brainOmega-3 fatty acids might require larger doses to be effective -- especially for people with high-risk geneUniversity of Southern California, July 21, 2020For years, a scientific puzzle has bedeviled researchers aiming to fight Alzheimer's disease, a common and incurable form of dementia.The results of numerous lab investigations and population studies support the preventive potential of omega-3 fatty acids, "good fats" found abundantly in fish. 

- All participants had a family history of the disease, a sedentary lifestyle and a diet low in fatty fish. 

- Fifteen carried a gene variant called APOE4, which is linked to inflammation in the brain and increases Alzheimer's risk by a factor of four or more; the other 18 were noncarriers.At random, participants were assigned to a treatment group or control group. 

- Members of the treatment group were asked to take supplements containing more than 2 grams of an omega-3 called docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) daily for six months. 

- Participants in both groups also were asked to take daily B-complex vitamins, which help the body process omega-3s.Dr. 

- In contrast, the DHA found in cerebrospinal fluid was only 28 percent higher in the treatment group than the control group. 

- Yassine and his co-authors also report that, within the treatment group, those without the risk-inflating APOE4 mutation showed an increase of EPA (anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acid) in their cerebrospinal fluid three times greater than what was seen in carriers of the gene. 

- "The bottom line is, before you embark upon very expensive clinical trials, you need to show proof of concept, that your drug is getting into the brain and changing biomarkers of disease in the right direction. 

- Their findings were published in The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine.Acupuncture is widely used in Asia as an alternative therapy for insomnia.In Western countries, the use of acupuncture is increasing.To determine the suitability of acupuncture as insomnia treatment, the researchers searched 11 databases from January 2008 to October 2017 for relevant RCTs.Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias.The researchers performed statistical analysis using RevMan 5.3 software then combined data in a meta-analysis according to a predefined protocol.They also performed trial sequential analysis when appropriate and assessed the quality of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).The researchers analyzed 73 RCTs that involved 5,533 participants. 

- Their results showed that real acupuncture treatment yielded better results than no treatment by reducing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores.Acupuncture, combined with medication, also showed better results than medication alone by decreasing PSQI total scores.Compared with estazolam, acupuncture exerted better effects on PSQI scores.It also caused fewer adverse events than western medications.Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that acupuncture benefits people with insomnia by improving their sleep quality. 

- The researchers recommend a larger sample size and more rigorously designed RCTs to explore this benefit further.Dietary guidelines advisory committee reinforces need for increased choline intakeVulnerable populations, including infants, toddlers, pregnant and lactating women, are at greatest risk for choline deficiencyHHS and Cornell University, July 20, 2020The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC or Committee) - a group comprised of 20 nationally recognized health and nutrition experts - published the Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 

- "The Committee's scientific report shines a light on the growing body of evidence that shows choline plays a critical role in health during specific life stages," says Marie Caudill, PhD, RD, Professor, Cornell University and an internationally recognized choline researcher. 

- "Choline is an essential nutrient that supports a variety of processes at all stages of life and throughout the body, including fetal and infant development; cognition and memory; energy and fitness; metabolism; and liver health. 

- While more research is needed for choline to reach the level of a 'nutrient of public health concern,' the Committee recognized choline as a 'nutrient that poses public health challenges' for all infants and toddlers between ages 12 and 24 months; and special attention around choline inadequacies was specifically noted for girls and boys ages 9 to 14; and the vulnerable pregnant population and women who are lactating. 

- "Americans need guidance on how to choose supplements to help fill nutrient gaps, particularly for pregnant women as most recognized prenatal vitamins don't contain enough--if any--choline. 

- ""Choline's increased recognition in the DGAC report is an important scientific milestone for the public health community," says Jonathan Bortz, MD, Senior Director, Nutrition Science, Balchem. 

- "Choline can be purchased online or in specialty stores as a stand-alone, over-the-counter supplement; incorporated into some prenatal vitamins or packaged along with prenatal vitamins; and fortified in branded milk products, specifically:- Bayer recently launched a "One A Day Women's Prenatal Advanced Complete Multivitamin with Brain Support," that includes a side-by-side prenatal multivitamin plus a supplement that provides 110mg of choline, helping to substantially close the gap in pregnant women's daily needs.- Danone's Horizon Organic brand developed milk for young children--Growing Years--that is fortified to contain 55mg of choline per serving, providing between 10 percent to 27 percent of children's daily needs, depending on age and gender. 

- "Sensory impairments could be due to underlying neurodegeneration or the same disease processes as those affecting cognition, such as stroke," said first author Willa Brenowitz, PhD, of the UCSF Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and the Weill Institute for Neurosciences. 

- "Alternatively, sensory impairments, particularly hearing and vision, may accelerate cognitive decline, either directly impacting cognition or indirectly by increasing social isolation, poor mobility and adverse mental health. 

- "The olfactory bulb, which is critical for smell, is affected fairly early on in the course of the disease," said Brenowitz. 

- "The 1,794 participants were recruited from a random sample of Medicare-eligible adults in the Health, Aging and Body Composition study. 

- "We found that with deteriorating multisensory functioning, the risk of cognitive decline increased in a dose-response manner," said senior author Kristine Yaffe, MD, of the UCSF departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Neurology, as well as the San Francisco VA Health Care System. 

- The former group was more likely to have completed high school (85 percent versus 72.1 percent), had less diabetes (16.9 percent versus 27.9 percent) and were marginally less likely to have cardiovascular disease, high-blood pressure and stroke.

A Revolution in American Medicine is Long OverdueRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDJuly 6, 2020The sweeping occurrence of CoV19 infections has contributed to a loss of jobs, careers, regular education for our children and has adversely impacted the health of otherwise healthy people. 

- But for tens of millions of Americans who have lost their health insurance or have not been covered, the situation is more dire. 

- One illness, one infectious disease, could push them over the edge into insolvency and bankruptcy. 

- The medical lobbies, insurance and hospital industries and Big Pharma assure that if you are hospitalized with CoV19 and don't have insurance, you will receive a bill for tens of thousands of dollars. 

- This confusion leaves citizens bewildered about how they will pay their bills unless a fundamental overhaul of medical insurance is undertaken. 

- What are your chances of joining the ranks of the 530,000 families that file bankruptcy annually for medical reasons? 

- According to a study published last year by the American Journal of Public Health, 66.5% of bankruptcies are medically-related. 

- In the past, it was rare for people to go bankrupt because they did not have accessible medical care. 

- The Hippocratic Oath was respected and no one was denied medical care because they could not afford it. 

- And the pharmaceutical and insurance industries are already capitalizing on this disaster.The Democrat Party's full throttle assault to undermine the legitimacy of Bernie Sanders' campaign was orchestrated by the insurance and medical industrial complex, which has influenced unbridled bias across the media waves. 

- After listening to dozens of commentators on CNN, MSNBC, Fox, and the pseudo-health journalists at the New York Times, and Washington Post, the false impression was created to perceive Bernie as only offering free stuff to everyone and at enormous cost to taxpayers.No one truly knows how much a national universal program would cost. 

- In effect, the entirety of corporate America and the deep state, its lobbyists and oligarchic billionaires, and their sounding board in the mainstream media, are on one side of the scale while the urgent humanitarian medical needs of average citizens are on the other. 

- There is no reason for having so many levels of bureaucracy between direct medical care and the patient. 

- Every industry directly involved in providing treatment and care would continue to profit. 

- Instead we have a medical lobby that is excessively greedy and eager to take advantage of loopholes in order to milk the system for whatever it is worth.But we can only have a viable Medicare for All after we seriously look at what it costs to treat a patient and make efforts to reduce the exorbitant waste that has been programmed into our current system. 

- Cases of uninsured people being treated for Cov19 have received medical bills upwards to $35,000 and conservatively there are 28 million uninsured citizens in the US at this moment and rising as unemployment increases. 

- Consequently only 1 in 7 Americans polled would not seek CoV treatment because of the cost.Based upon earlier figures between 2012-2015, about $2.6 trillion can be saved by removing bureaucratic waste and profiteering. 

- This includes $275 billion on private insurance paperwork, $55.6 billion on liability insurance, $471 billion for insurance billing, $140 billion for medical fraud (2016), $210 billion for unnecessary medical testing, and $190 billion for wasteful administrative services. 

- Back in 2016, the British Medical Journal reported that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US. 

- As a result over $1 trillion is spent on avoidable medical errors.Universal healthcare will not break the economy. 

- What is breaking the economy is our current broken medical system. 

- Universal, quality care is easily within reach but only after the health of the population is given preference over the healthcare system's vulture capitalists. 

- Then Americans will no longer have to worry about bankruptcy, which further contributes to the stresses associated with ill health, because they cannot afford the treatments or medications without putting themselves and their family into perpetual debt.Second, providing universal healthcare does not guarantee that patients will receive quality care. 

- If we are truly honest with ourselves and ask whether the US has the best medical care available, the answer should be a resounding no. 

- However, chronic care for treating heart disease, cancer, diabetes, pain management and neurological and mental health conditions has been a dismal failure. 

- We would be wise to make medical education free in return for young doctors committing themselves to charging reasonable fees if they wish to remain within the system. 

- A viable prevention program would begin by supporting and mandating holistic health programs in our schools beginning with grade school. 

- Why does offering school courses in "How to be Healthy" seem absurd when it has been shown repeatedly in the scientific peer-review literature and efforts in other advanced nations to avoid preventable illnesses and further reduce medical costs? 

- But in order to launch a comprehensive preventative  program at a national scale, only respected educated health consumers should be in charge. 

- Entities representing private corporate interests should be prohibited since they are responsible for the medical disasters that now demand for universal healthcare. 

- If Obamacare and the current corporate medical establishment were truly effective, there would be no discussion about Medicare for All.Hence this program would save nearly $2 trillion a year and help prevent tens of millions of diseases. 

- The nation would be much healthier if comprehensive measures were taken to prevent disease in the first place.

- Iatraogenic medicine, or medical error, is now the third leading cause of death in the US after cardiovascular disease and cancer. 

- Consequently our health agencies' oversight and monitoring of drugs on the market is dismal.One of the worst corporate deals the US government may have ever made in modern history was to acquire the American subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical firm Merck and Company during the first world war. 

- The scam was orchestrated through personal bank accounts with the sole purpose of advancing drug approvals through foreign nations' regulatory medical agencies.One of the largest frauds in recent medical history was the company's anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx that resulted in fines above $4.8 billion for causing over a minimum 60,000 deaths from sudden heart attacks and over 120,000 serious medical injuries. 

- The Australian government launched a class action suit against the drug maker on charges that employees schemed a fake scientific paper that was ghostwritten for a medical journal in order to put Vioxx into a positive light. 

- Some, including Dr. James Fries at Sanford University's medical school, were clinical investigators who happened to speak out about the drug's shortcomings. 

- Merck's revolving door is not limited to our federal health agencies, but also fully infiltrates some of the world's most shadowy international PR firms that specialize in whitewashing the public images of executive elites, corporations and in the case of the PR firm Burson-Marsteller even dictators. 

- "But Merck's efforts to conceal the dangers of its products, falsify data about drugs' efficacy and safety and exaggeration of medical claims go back sixty years. 

- In 2007, its cholesterol drug Zetia was shown to increase liver disease. 

- Known as a "carrier solution," the standard scientific protocol does not designate it as a proper placebo for measuring the efficacy and disease risks of a drug. 

- None of Merck's vaccines have ever undergone a "rigorous review" prior to regulatory approval.Although not completely innocent from internal unfairness and conflicts of interest, the Cochrane Database Collaboration arguably remains the most reliable resource for analysis of drugs, vaccines and medical devices in the evidence-based medical establishment. 

- In its 2016 analysis of Merck's human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil, the investigators were so alarmed they filed a complaint against the European Medical Agency for failing to adequately assess the vaccine's neurological harms.As we have recently witnessed with Monsanto's Roundup and Bayer's settlement of $10 billion to cover 80,000 lawsuits, Gardasil may very well become the company's Achilles heel. 

- The development, scientific rationale, fraudulent clinical trials and data reporting, and inside negotiations with federal health officials to market the vaccine to pre-teen and teen girls and boys, is a story riddled with misconduct. 

- Gardasil's success has nothing to do with the prevention of an urgent national health need. 

- In his letter to the French government in defiance of Merck's lobbying efforts, Delephine stated:"A compulsory health measure should not be based on faith in vaccination or hidden conflicts of interest, but on proven facts, verifiable by every citizen. 

- "An article published in the French journal Agoravox noted that other national health ministries are coming around to acknowledge that Gardasil is an extremely unsafe vaccine. 

- Medical researchers at the University of South Alabama presented their paper at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology's annual conference. 

- Kennedy's in-depth investigations through his Children's Health Defense organization has uncovered evidence that the vaccine increases birth defects in children conceived of HPV-vaccinated moms; miscarriages have increased 2000 percent above normal, and girls are experiencing serious reproductive complications, including infertility, at approximately ten-fold above the normal rate. 

- There is a 10-fold increase for ovarian failure, and 1 in 37 girls who receive the vaccine will experience an autoimmune disease after 6 months of receiving the series of injections. 

- Sadly, across the nation, politicians from both sides of the aisle in state legislatures, notably Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York, are doing Merck's bidding to mandate Gardasil for all girls and boys upon entering school.Based upon Kennedy's research and documents received from Freedom of Information Act filings, during Merck's own Gardasil clinical trials, 2.3 percent of girls and women between the ages of 9 through 26 developed a serious autoimmune disease and crippling neurological disorders within seven months of vaccination. 

- The most frequent adverse effects were arthritis and anthropathy, autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, Raynaud's Phenomenon, rheumatoid arthritis and uveitis. 

- He stated during the Progressive Radio Network broadcast that according to Merck's own statistics, girls are one hundred times more likely to experience a serious adverse effect from the vaccine than to be protected from cervical cancer.In a 2012 article published in the Journal of Law and Medical Ethics, researchers at the University of British Columbia wrote that ever since Gardasil was approved in 2006, Merck has engaged in an "overly aggressive marketing strategies and lobbying campaigns aimed at promoting Gardasil as a mandatory vaccine." 

- In the case of its expanded Gardasil-9 for adults between the ages of 27 to 45, the company applied for fast tracking two days after the Journal of Toxicological and Environmental Health published a study that the HPV vaccine was lowering the probability of pregnancy for women in their 20s.Unfortunately, the media has indiscriminately colluded with Merck's scam. 

- Its prime directive is selling drugs; its history of misdemeanors and criminal activities should indicate the company holds little integrity in its commitment to prevent and treat disease. 

- Therefore we recommend people to support the efforts of Bobby Kennedy and the Children's Health Defense in its lawsuit against Merck's Gardasil. 

- I am a nationally respected expert in the fields of health, nutrition and alternative medicine. 

- I hold a doctorate in human nutrition and public health science and have authored over 40 books, including several New York Times best sellers.I wish to extend my gratitude for you addressing the flaws in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and introducing Senate bill S.1914 that would remove immunity from large tech companies and pressure them with an external audit. 

- Past court cases by individuals against online providers, including AOL, eBay, Google, Craigslist, etc, have overwhelming ruled in favor of the defendants and granted immunity under Section 230.Although most attention has been given to the large internet providers and social media firms such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc, the internet's most visited website worldwide, other entities have not been properly scrutinized in an equal manner.Although the S.1914 bill is an important step to correct the unanticipated flaws in Section 230, it unfortunately does not reach far enough and therefore it will fail to correct other forms of bias that are detrimental to public discourse and social health. 

- This would include the Wikimedia Foundation, albeit a 501(c) organization, that collaborates closely with large Silicon Valley social media firms.We would also recommend the criteria for the types of bias be expanded to include prejudices that endanger public health. 

- Google's parent company, Alphabet, is also a pharmaceutical company with a vested interest in shaping public opinion on matters of medicine and health. 

- Already, Google's YouTube relies on Wikipedia pages as a resource for political correctness and, in our estimation, biased opinions.A recent study published in the Medical Journal of Australia identified serious errors in Dr. Google, Google's online health advice site. 

- This is a serious threat to both national and global health at time when people and patients increasingly rely on the internet for information about existing conditions and undiagnosed symptoms.This risk is equally true for Wikipedia, which now ranks number one on the internet for health information. 

- The Wikimedia Foundation has no vetting process by medical and health experts to validate the information millions of people access daily. 

- A review analysis published by the American Osteopathic Association found that "Most Wikipedia articles representing the 10 most costly medical conditions in the United States contain many errors when checked against standard peer-reviewed sources. 

- Other studies in the medical literature have drawn similar conclusions; nevertheless, despite Wikipedia being ranked at the top most used site for the public's searches for medical information, it does not rank on any recommended online medical resource list within the profession. 

- And yet, Google will be relying upon Wikipedia as a reliable resource for health topics.Although the Foundation does not qualify under the bill's revenue requirements, it does so for the site's monthly usage. 

- There should be no exclusion that allows for obvious malicious libel.After many hundreds of hours of research during the past two years,  we have documented evidence of the WikiMedia Foundation's efforts to act with extreme bias against notable national and international figures and entire industries that curtail freedom of speech, public discourse and debate and pose serious dangers to public health.For your review I am enclosing my person biography, a summary of our investigations and one of our more informative investigative articles about Wikipedia's violations of the Communications Decency Act, failure to adhere to its own rules for neutrality, and evidence of libelous actions.Sincerely,Gary Null, PhD

- Control not just of the global health bodies that can coordinate a worldwide vaccination program, or the governments that will mandate such an unprecedented campaign, but control over the global population itself

Robert Kennedy Jr is an ardent defender of the environment and the health of children. 

- Last year he founded Childrens Health Defense -- a children's advocacy organization dedicating to enlightening the public about toxic risks to children, including vaccines and aluminum, fluoride, pesticides, food additives, EMF technology among others. 

- One of Trump's leading attorneys is Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz who recently went on record saying,"Let me put it very clearly, you have no constitutional right to endanger the public and spread disease.... You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business.... if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor's office and plunge a needle into your arm. 

- The prevailing medical establishment has become dominated by a rapidly expanding private industry obsessed with viruses and the invention of pandemics for enormous profit. 

- This obsession has hijacked not only medical practice and legislators who are determined to mandate vaccination, but has also infiltrated the entire mainstream media. 

- At this moment, Kohnlein's 2007 book Virus Mania: Avian Flu, Cervical Cancer, SARS, BSE, Hepatitis C, AIDS, Polio is essential reading to expose the life-threatening failures in modern medical science's efforts to tackle viral threats. 

- And this atmosphere could potentially end in a serious medical disaster on the not-too-distant horizon. 

- The bad news is that the government and federal health agencies will very likely ram the first promising vaccine through the regulatory channels without having been properly evaluated for its efficacy and safety.Without serious critical thought, the demand for a vaccine now outweighs the risks. 

- Evans also worries about "the shredding of regulations and regulatory norms as part of their [the federal health agencies] response to this outbreak and this is a very dangerous proposition. 

- But now this is all being ignored within the Trump White House, the CDC, and across most of the medical establishment, particularly the private vaccine makers. 

- In addition, the media continues to fuel our vaccine mania, priming the public to willingly surrender their bodies to the syringe under a pretext of being protected from future CoV outbreaks.Perhaps the most disturbing problem our national public health faces is the failure of our leading health agencies -- the CDC, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, and the World Health Organization -- to acknowledge the overwhelming evidence that no vaccine developed during the past half century is truly safe and effective for all. 

- Have meticulous independent studies been performed to compare the quality of health between vaccinated and non-vaccinated participants? 

- Several years ago the World Health Organization listed vaccine opponents among the 10 leading threats to global health.But no one considers that the many millions of people who either themselves or their children received a vaccine and experienced serious adverse effects were at one time pro-vaccination. 

- In other words, every vaccine may or not be effective and there is no proof they protect everyone.There is also the utterly absurd notion that whenever someone receives a vaccine and does not come down with the disease, 100 percent of the credit is given to the vaccine's efficacy.And where are the real advocates who are speaking on behalf of the victims from vaccine injuries? 

- Nor are advocates to be found in federal and state health agencies, in most of the medical community nor across the spectrum of the media. 

- Rather, those who refuse to take unsafe vaccines are blamed for spreading fear, uncertainty, conspiracies and even infectious disease.But now those who have been injured or their loved ones are speaking out in greater unison. 

- His guest grossly mischaracterized 5G technology without once mentioning its documented dangers to human health, the environment and all life on the planet.We hope that Carlson will review the following summarized information and invite a knowledgeable and qualified scientist, such as Dr. Devra Davis, Prof. Martin Pall or another among the many experts in electromagnetic frequency radiation risks and present the medical and scientific sides of 5G that Tucker's guest ignored. 

- This outline was presented by Dr. Martin Pall, a Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Medical Sciences at Washington State University to the National Institutes of Health. 

- These can cause cancer and mutations in the sexual germ lines.Apoptosis:  EMFs contribute to programmed cell death that in turn leads to reproductive and neurodegenerative disorders.Oxidative Stress:  Free radical damage that has been associated with numerous health conditions including cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic inflammation, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, cellular death and agingEndocrine Effects: According Dr. Pall, every hormonal system in the body is adversely affected by EMF exposure.Excessive Intracellular Calcium:  Ca2+ is critical for cellular activityCancer:  There are 35 separate scientific reviews of the body of peer-reviewed literature providing evidence that EMFs increase carcinogenesis, promote and progress tumor development and contribute to metastasis.Each of the above medical conditions have been thoroughly-studied. 

- There are also other medical conditions that are less researched but are likely associated with EMF exposure:Cardiac Effects. 

- The same is true for his treatment of GMOs and vaccines. 

- Now he needs to apply the same investigative acumen into 5G and other health risks created by private industries.

- Wikipedia: The Flawed Non-EncyclopediaRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, May 13, 2020At this very moment, there are highly respected physicians, epidemiologists, medical biostaticians, forensic experts and other scientists coming forth to voice concerns over the information being disseminated in the mainstream media about the COVID-19 pandemic. 

- In many cases their own professional assessments are at odds with what we hear from the World Health Organization, the CDC, and Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. 

- Seemingly, every day a new voice joins this choir, which compels us to critically reexamine the entrenched medical establishment's unequivocal statements.Never before have we been so inundated with fake news, conspiratorial musings, and ideological rants that frequently appear more hallucinatory than factual. 

- The early scandals in medical journals, which were publishing junk research to favor private pharmaceutical drugs and interests, resulted in rules for authors to list their conflicts of interests with drug companies and other profit-driven institutions. 

- Medical journals thereby became more transparent.Similarly, there are hundreds of thousands of voices, including leaders in a variety of medical and health professions, who are voicing warnings about the reliability of information found on the world's most referenced encyclopedia, Wikipedia. 

- Large segments of the Wikipedia's pages on medical modalities are grossly inaccurate. 

- Worse, much is mean spirited, laced with unbridled vindictive and this presents a very real danger to the public health worldwide. 

- A puzzle that may baffle the inquiring mind is how a college dropout, a computer nerd without any notable biological or medical background, and at one time the wealthiest person in the world before being unseated by the self-centered playboy Jeff Bezos, could rise to become one of humanity's leading spokespersons about vaccination. 

- Although there is nothing wrong with philanthropic enterprises for causes we believe in, what is disturbing is that a non-medical expert has assumed the role of being a national thought leader on vaccination safety and policy. 

- GAVI is a global collaboration that includes governments health ministries, the Rockefeller Foundation, the World Bank, WHO, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, UNICEF, corporate vaccine makers, and other influential entities. 

- But of course cleaning up the water and sewage systems of Africa would revolutionize the health conditions of the Continent.” Far more effective would be the Foundation donating its billions to improve sanitation and hygiene, and provide nutrition to the 2.6 billion people who have little to none, for increasing clean water sources so 900 million global residents can have access to drinkable water (now at 1 in 3 Africans). 

- Instead, the Foundation could be funding thousands of health clinics focusing on the chronic illnesses these populations suffer from most. 

- “Bad water,” says the Stockholm International Water Institute’s director, Anders Bentell, “kills more people than HIV, malaria and war together.”  And globally, contaminated water, which kills approximately 9 million people annually, is a far more serious crisis than the evidence now indicates for coronavirus.Over the past several years, the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet has printed a series of in-depth analyses of the Gates Foundation with disturbing revelations. 

- In a September 2008 article, “Misfinancing Global Health: A Case for Transparency in Disbursements and Decision Making,” the authors’ investigation came to the conclusion that aside from excessive funding of high profile Western institutions and organizations, there was “a heavy bias in funding towards malaria and HIV/AIDS, with relatively little investment into tuberculosis, maternal and child health, and nutrition–with chronic diseases being entirely absent from its spending portfolio.” And a later study by Dr. David McCoy from the Center for International Health found that “the grants made by the Foundation do not reflect the burden of disease endured by those in deepest poverty.” None of these findings have been covered to any extent by mainstream media nor any governing body. 

- Gates has gained free entrance into the offices and boardrooms of all the leading players savoring the opportunity to launch a fast-tracked coronavirus vaccine that may likely be made mandatory for Americans, including National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Disease director Anthony Fauci, the CDC's vaccine advisory committee and the WHO. 

- Bobby Kennedy Jr. at the Children's Health Defense organization has listed some of the vaccination debacles that are directly associated with his Foundation:In 2002, operatives in the Gates network enforced a meningitis campaign in Sub-Sahara Africa that paralyzed up to 500 children.In 2010, his foundations support for Glaxo's experimental malaria vaccine trials killed 151 African infants and seriously injured another 1,000.Gates collaboration with India's National Technical Advisory Group resulted in a catastrophe of unmonitored overlapping polio immunization programs triggering an epidemic of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis that affected 490,000 children. 

- Due to his stature among governmental and international health agencies, he has not been held accountable. 

- Equally worrisome, aside from his vaccine frenzy, Gates makes efforts to influence the nation's health policies. 

- There would be no need for citizen billionaires to be taking the helm to manipulate national policy responses to health crises, such as the COVC-19 pandemic, if there was in place a functioning healthcare system. 

- For too long, the US's federal health agencies have been thoroughly compromised and corrupted by private pharmaceutical interests. 

- The pandemic is revealing to Americans that we have the most dysfunctional medical system in the developed world.Unfortunately the wealthiest elite on the planet are rarely questioned about the correctness of their actions and schemes. 

- As long as a Bill Gates says he is giving huge sums of money to a cause to end disease and suffering, we are not suppose to probe further. 

- He said, “If we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that [projected to be 9 billion people by 2050] by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.“ Therefore it was shocking to learn that a tetanus vaccine administered to Kenyan women in child bearing years was purportedly laced with Human Chorionic Gondatropin (hCG) that causes miscarriage and renders a woman sterile. 

- Curiously, Brian Shilhavy at Health Impact News observed, "there was no outbreak of tetanus in Kenya, on the perceived threat of tetanus due to local flood conditions." 

- Therefore, why the campaign to vaccinate young women en masse?In conclusion, we have the world's second richest billionaire who deeply believes he has a personal authority to be a policy maker for America's public health.

- Why the World Health Organization Deserves Our DistrustRichard Gale & Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, May 8, 2020Many more questions are being raised than there are answers being discovered concerning the recent strains of coronavirus. 

- These are just several of the important questions that still require definitive answers.The ultimate international authority for infectious diseases is the World Health Organization (WHO). 

- For the majority of the medical community, the media and the average person, the WHO is the front line command post for medical prevention (i.e., vaccination) and treatment. 

- Consequently it's rulings are often regarded as the gold standard by which many nations design their health policies and intervening protocols to protect their citizens. 

- On matters of global health, the WHO holds dominance.We are currently being told by the Director General of the WHO that the solutions for curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic are self-isolation, distancing, masks, and, for those in acute stages of infection, ventilation. 

- And in this effort, the WHO is a close ally and advocate in the US's federal health system, notably the CDC and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci.Most people assume the WHO acts independently from private commercial and national government interests for the welfare of the world's population. 

- Moreover, the very legitimacy of the WHO as a gold standard of health is questionable. 

- We would also add that its level of incompetence has resulted in serious misinformation about the medical risks of vaccines and other health-threatening chemicals. 

- Now we know it is perhaps the most transmittable respiratory viral infection encountered in modern medical history.Given the halls of power within the WHO, we are outlining some of the more salient reasons why the organization's declarations about infectious diseases, pandemics and vaccination should not entirely be trusted.Vaccine Promotional MisconductVery few will know that for a long time, the WHO's recommendations for certain vaccines were kept secret. 

- Dr. Girard was called upon as a medical expert by the French courts in a criminal trial against the WHO after French health officials obliged the organization to launch its universal Hepatitis B vaccine campaign. 

- Moreover, the British Medical Journal reported that the WHO failed to report conflicts of interest in its H1N1 advisory group. 

- The popular German magazine Der Spiegel reported:“The WHO and those in charge of public health, the virologists and the pharmaceutical laboratories....  created a whole system around the imminence of a pandemic. 

- Barbara Loe Fisher at the National Vaccine Information Center estimates that "only about 10 percent of total funding provided by Gavi ($862M) was used to strengthen health systems in developing countries, such as improving sanitation and nutrition, while nearly 80 percent was used to purchase, deliver and promote vaccines. 

- In summary, there is a strong rationale to suggest that the WHO, aside from its global health programs in other countries, is largely doing the bidding of the US government to advance corporate interests and American neoliberal hegemony.Vaccine Adverse Effects Monitoring System Needs OverhaulThe WHO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is the group responsible for administering vaccine programs in poorer, developing countries. 

- In India, health officials recorded upwards to 8,190 additional infant deaths annually following pentavalent vaccination. 

- It is as if the deaths of children in low (and middle) income countries are of no consequence.”The WHO's Director General's Troubled PastGiven the enormous number of experts in infectious disease and control, it is astounding that the WHO's current Director General is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus. 

- Tedros served dual roles as the country's Health and Foreign Minister. 

- And in the mid-1990s, a tetanus vaccine being administered to Nicaraguan and Filipino girls and women in their child-bearing years was discovered to contain HCG, which accounted for a large number of spontaneous abortions that were reported by Catholic health workers.Illegal Vaccine ExperimentsIn 2014, The Economic Times of India published a report that provided details of a joint venture between the WHO and the Gates Foundation to test an experimental HPV vaccine on approximately 16,000 tribal girls between the ages of 9 and 15 unwittingly. 

- Investigations led by Indian health officials uncovered gross violations in India's laws regarding medical safety. 

- Days before the summit, one of the WHO's medical directors for vaccination, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, appeared in a public advertisement touting the unquestionable safety of vaccines and ridiculing parents who speak out against vaccination. 

- However, during the Summit, the same Dr. Swaminathan acknowledged vaccine health risks and stated, "We really don't have very good safety monitoring systems." 

- Another Summit participant, Dr. Heidi Larson stated,"We have a very wobbly ‘health professional frontline’ that is starting to question vaccines and the safety of vaccines. 

- I mean most medical school curriculums, even nursing curriculums, I mean in medical school you are lucky if you have half a day on vaccines.”And more noteworthy were the statements by Dr. Martin Howell Friede, Coordinator of the WHO's Initiative for Vaccine Research,"... 

- In both countries, the WHO has been very active in providing health needs to the populations affected. 

- According to an article published in the British Medical Journal in 2013, the WHO intentionally suppressed the scientific evidence . 

- Hans von Sponeck, a former Assistant Secretary General for the United Nations has suggested that "the US government sought to prevent WHO from surveying areas in southern Iraq where DU has been used and caused serious health and environmental dangers." 

- However, the above provide sufficient evidence to argue the case that, at least within the upper echelons of the WHO, global health does not stand in high priority. 

- On the other hand, the WHO's leaders are there largely because the powers of Washington, London and the pharmaceutical industry benefit by the organization advancing its agendas.Of course, the WHO is not the only health entity with a legacy of corruption. 

- Corruption appears to be systemic throughout global health and national health agencies. 

- This topic was featured last year in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet. 

- Author Dr. Patricia Garcia writes,"Corruption is embedded in health systems. 

- Throughout my life—as a researcher, public health worker, and a Minister of Health—I have been able to see entrenched dishonesty and fraud. 

- But despite being one of the most important barriers to implementing universal health coverage around the world, corruption is rarely openly discussed. 

- "Bear in mind, the WHO, along with Bill Gates and his Foundation, and Anthony Fauci at the National Institutes for Allergy and Infectious Disease, are leading the efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

A Challenge to Fox’s Medical Expert Dr. Marc SiegelGary Null PhD, May 4, 2020Last Friday evening, Fox’s Tucker Carlson Show invited his favorite physician, Dr. Marc Siegel from New York University’s medical school, on his program. 

- He made an emphatic statement that Vitamin C plays no role in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus despite evidence to the contrary. 

- CNBC News has already reported that White House advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci and other US health officials are collaborating with the drug company Moderna to fast track its COVID19 vaccine that is now in development. 

- In order to expedite medical interventions that are determined to be critical, the FDA permits fast tracking, which lightens the otherwise rigorous clinical trial process and lessens the requirement of long-term assessment to properly evaluate a drug’s or vaccine’s efficacy and safety. 

- Either they are both uninformed about the peer-review medical literature in the National Library of Medicine and the countless positive patient results from physicians using complementary medicine and Vitamin C therapy for over 5 decades to treat infectious illnesses, including HIV and respiratory infections or they are in denial.This may be intentional neglect – making a concerted choice to refuse to acknowledge something in order to avoid contradicting personally held beliefs.We hope that Tucker and Siegel will be open to interview doctors and patients who have defeated viral infections by non-drug regimens and without vaccination. 

- There are over 2,600 studies listed in the National Institutes of Health PubMed database specifically addressing Vitamin C therapy and supplementation to prevent and treat infectious diseases; most of these concern respiratory infections.Below are some of the more important studies, especially regarding the importance of Vitamin C for strengthening the innate and adaptive immune systems. 

- Both of these immune systems are essential for protecting ourselves from COVID19, whereas a vaccine will only act on a single immune system that triggers antibody production.Current Clinical Trial Underway and listed in the US National Library of Medicine’s database of Clinical Trials:  Vitamin C Infusion for the Treatment of Severe 2019-nCoV Infected PneumoniaA new clinical trial to test high-dose vitamin C in patients with COVID-19 (University of Otago, New Zealand)Critical Care, April 2020Efficacy of Mega dose Vitamin C against Covid19Vitamin C and SARS coronavirus (University of Helsinki)Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, December 2203The possibility that vitamin C affects severe viral respiratory tract infections would seem to warrant further study, especially in light of the recent SARS epidemic.Vitamin C and Infections (University of Helskinki)Nutrients, April 2017Reviewed 148 studies on vitamin C deficiency associated with diverse viral and bacteria infections and pneumonia.Found that in active people, shortened duration of colds effectivelyThe effectiveness of vitamin C in preventing and relieving the symptoms of virus-induced respiratory infectionsJournal of Manipulative Physiological Therapy, October 1999Megadose Vitamin C before and after flu infections and colds improved symptoms compared to placebo groupThe clinical effects of vitamin C supplementation in elderly hospitalised patients with acute respiratory infections (Huddersfield University)International Journal Vitamin Research, 1994A randomised double-blind trial showing the effectiveness of vitamin C/placebo supplementation conducted on 57 elderly patients admitted to hospital with acute respiratory infections (bronchitis and bronchopneumonia).Vitamin C Is an Essential Factor on the Anti-viral Immune Responses through the Production of Interferon-α/β at the Initial Stage of Influenza A Virus (H3N2) Infection (Seoul National University College of MedicineImmunology Network, April 2013Vitamin C is an essential factor for anti-viral immune responses at the early stage of Influenza A infection.Vitamin C Is an Essential Factor on the Anti-viral Immune Responses through the Production of Interferon-α/β at the Initial Stage of Influenza A Virus (H3N2) Infection (Seoul University College of Medicine)Immunology Network, April 2013the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lung and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-α/β, were increased in the lung.

- Not only has the American medical system and federal health agencies been shown to be naked, we are also discovering we cannot rely on epistemological statistics and computer modeling alone to account for our flawed health policies.Aside from the pandemic's toll on people's lives, there is also its impact upon the national economies and the global economy at large that is barely being discussed in any depth. 

- You have no income or savings and no health insurance. 

- The pandemic is not solely a health crisis; it is equally an existential crisis, an impasse in the global civilization that is forcing us to realize that our over dependence and perverse reliance upon natural resources, such as fuel, energy, food and corrupt banking and healthcare services, is fragile.

- Its negligence in fact supports the silencing and prosecution of whistleblowers in government who come forth publicly to warn about criminal activities and corruption in government agencies;As our civil court system is being transformed into a military court model, it erodes the legal rights of citizens against government tyranny upon which our legal system is based;Ignoring the corruption and funding behind the entire private prison system that relies upon an infinite growth model of inmates, and the criminalization of poverty;Consistently acts against the rights of workers and unions, favoring treaties such as NAFTA, GATT and the forthcoming Trans Pacific and Trans Atlantic partnerships that further sell out American workers in return to greater profits to be overseas for the 1 percent;Gives preferential treatment to the medical insurance industry, which contributes nothing to the prevention and treatment of disease, and is silent about the private medical establishment writing the healthcare laws for the country;Completely complicit in advancing the pharmaceutical agenda that vaccines are effective and safe and should be mandated nationally;Allowing the private agro-chemical industry headed by Monsanto and Dupont to write the agricultural laws in the country so that genetically modified crops and organisms are wrongfully considered safe for human and animal consumption and carry no risk to the environment;Denying the Federal Reserve’s role in demolishing America’s middle class and protecting the Wall Street oligarchy’s control over the Fed and US Treasury at the public’s expense;Judging Wall Street banks more worthy of forgiveness to receive debt relief and assistance from taxpayers than debt forgiveness to Americans who are underwater in their mortgages, credit, student loans and small business debts;Gross failure to independently analyze the adverse effects on the domestic economy and society from trillion dollar bailouts to Wall Street and mega-corporations;Increasing America’s military budget at home and abroad rather than feeding the nation’s starving children and dealing with the growing number of homeless who have suffered at the hands of the government’s compliance with Wall Street disaster capitalists;Ignoring the need for independent investigations and hearings into the current and past four administrations into the invasions of sovereign countries and covert efforts to fuel regime change;Ignoring the thousands of homicides and suicides committed by American soldiers and veterans who have been abused and forgotten by the US government since the launch of the war against terror and failing to make the association that the fundamental problem is war and the US's imperial ambitions;Failure to criticize despotic regimes that the US supports with dismal human rights records such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, Israel’s apartheid of Palestine, Brazil, Colombia, India;Launching sanctions against Iran that are responsible for untold suffering of Iranian citizens and children without any international proof that Iran poses either a regional or nuclear threat;From the perspective of universal values and higher spiritual ethics, these are among both Democrats' and Republicans' many faults.

- Perhaps we have all seen the images of medical personnel having to wear black garbage bags as protective gear in a New York hospital or nurses' reports about having to wash and share face masks due to shortages. 

- Funding that should go towards a resilient medical infrastructure and preventative health measures in times of emergency has been neglected for decades. 

- Perhaps we have all seen the images of medical personnel having to wear black garbage bags as protective gear in a New York hospital or nurses' reports about having to wash and share face masks due to shortages. 

- Funding that should go towards a resilient medical infrastructure and preventative health measures in times of emergency has been neglected for decades. 

- "In the US, which closely follows (or controls) the World Health Organization (WHO), it is a larger mess. 

- One does not require a medical degree to realize how this is resulting in faulty tabulation of infection and death rates.The US has also adopted the WHO guidelines according to the National Vital Statistics System. 

- A NVSS document explaining how deaths should be reported on death certificates states, "COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death." 

- We already know that the virus is most lethal to the elderly and persons with pre-existing medical conditions.Below is a chart produced by the NVSS showing weekly pneumonia deaths from 2013 to the present.Note the dramatic unprecedented decrease in deaths associated with pneumonia since the arrival of COVID-19 in the US. 

- It is an excellent propaganda tool for keeping people nervous when flu season arrives in order to get rid of and distribute the 160 million-plus vaccine doses our tax dollars purchase every year.As physician Dr. Ken Stoller wrote to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services,"US data on influenza deaths are false and misleading. 

- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledges a difference between flu death and flu associated death yet uses the terms interchangeably. 

- Compounding these problems is a marketing of fear—a CDC communications strategy in which medical experts "predict dire outcomes" during flu seasons. 

- The world's experts at the WHO, British Health Ministry, and the CDC could not have been more wrong in their predictions in their fear tactics.Curiously, the Johns Hopkins researchers estimated 61,000 deaths during the 2017-2018 flu season while the CDC reported it being over 80,000, a 25% difference. 

- This also completely ignores co-morbidity, deaths directly due to other medical complications, usually pre-existing, that are independent from the virus.Equally challenging is the lack of a universal and accurate test for proper viral identification. 

- This is not sound medical protocol.

- High-mobility group box I protein (HMGB1) and HMGB1-mediated inflammatory responses have been attributed with memory impairment in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD).”Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Wenzhou Medical University, “There is accumulating evidence to suggest curcumin is a potent anti-inflammatory polyphenol. 

- Curcumin 10 mu M was administrated 1 h before A beta(25-45) treatment. 

- According to David Llewellyn, one of the authors of the study, their research “delivers a really important message that undermines a fatalistic view of dementia.”Study finds that Pilates significantly improves blood pressure in young, obese womenMarymount University (US), April 1, 2020A new paper in The American Journal of Hypertension, published by Oxford University Press, finds that mat Pilates may be an effective strategy to improve cardiovascular health for young obese women, a population that is at risk for hypertension and early vascular complications.With an estimated 9 million participants in 2018 and a series of celebrity endorsements, including Beyoncé and Emma Stone, mat Pilates training has seen a recent resurgence in popularity. 

- It has become one of the most widely known wellness routines in the United States. 

- The program emphasizes core strength, flexibility, body posture, and controlled breathing.At the same time, the prevalence of obesity in young adults has become a major public health issue. 

- Though it is well-documented that exercise is a key factor in preventing and managing cardiovascular health problems, obese women tend not to maintain traditional workout routines. 

- The participants were free of chronic diseases, were non-smokers and performed less than 90 minutes of regular exercise per week. 

- The training increased over the 12 weeks, with the repetition of each exercise steadily increasing. 

- Our findings provide evidence that Mat Pilates benefit cardiovascular health by decreasing blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and body fatness in young obese women with elevated blood pressure. 

- Because adherence to traditional exercise (both aerobic and resistance) is low in obese individuals, Mat Pilates Training might prove an effective exercise alternative for the prevention of hypertension and cardiovascular events in young obese adults. 

- The researchers noted a correlation between increased activity in the nucleus accumbens when viewing sexually suggestive images and sexual activity (both alone and with a partner).Based on these results, scientists believe that further research into how the nucleus accumbens and the brain’s reward centers react to images could be useful for predicting health risks, such as obesity and sexually transmitted diseases (STD). 

- "There is evidence here that emotional health and regulation improve with age," said Daisy Burr, a Duke PhD student who led the study with Gregory Samanez-Larkin, an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience. 

- "If we are to change the weight trajectory of whole populations, we may learn more from understanding how commercial diet companies engage and retain their customers, and translate that knowledge into more effective health promotion campaigns," they conclude.Dietary niacin intake affects risk of hip fracture, hip bone mineral densityMedical College of Georgia and University of Washington, April 2, 2020Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is an essential micronutrient that helps the body break down carbohydrates, fats and proteins and convert them into energy. 

- To investigate this, researchers from different universities in the U.S. examined the association of dietary niacin intake with multiple skeletal health parameters, such as bone mineral density (BMD), hip fractures and body composition.In their paper, which appeared in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, they detailed how consuming too much or too little of this important vitamin can affect bone health, particularly in the elderly.Low or high intake of niacin can increase the risk of hip fractures in older adultsAccording to the researchers, interest in niacin has increased recently due to its potential involvement in diseases associated with aging. 

- However, to date, no study has investigated its influence on bone health, particularly in African American and white men and women.For their study, the researchers recruited 5,187 men and women from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a population-based study of coronary heart disease and stroke in adults aged 65 and above. 

- Each had completed surveys about their sleep habits, marijuana use and mental health.They found that about one-third of subjects who started using marijuana regularly before age 18 had insomnia in adulthood, compared to less than 20% among those who didn't use cannabis regularly as teens. 

- The serum levels of vitamins A, D, and E were measured and compared, and two-category logistic regression was used for correlation analysis of vitamins A, D, and E levels with nsMPP and sMPP. 

- Vitamins E and D in the sMPP samples were significantly lower (vitamin E 7.43 +/- 1.55 vs. 8.22 +/- 2.22, P=0.0104; vitamin D 23.08 +/- 11.0 vs. 32.07 +/- 19.2, P=0.0007) than that in the nsMPP group; both sMPP and nsMPP did not show a deficiency of vitamins E and D. Logistic regression analysis revealed that vitamin A deficiency was significantly (OR 0.001, 95% CI: 0.001-0.334, P=0.009) associated with sMPP, and vitamin A supplementation could reduce the incidence of sMPP. 

- Vitamin A deficiency is associated with sMPP and more likely present in the younger sMPP samples.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Therefore, it is important to watch and supplement vitamin A in M. pneumoniae infection patients.”Regular exercise benefits immunity -- even in isolationUniversity of Bath (UK), March 31, 2020Being in isolation without access to gyms and sports clubs should not mean people stop exercising, according to a new study from researchers at the University of Bath. 

- Keeping up regular, daily exercise at a time when much of the world is going into isolation will play an important role in helping to maintain a healthy immune system.The analysis, published in the international journal Exercise Immunology Review, involving leading physiologists Dr James Turner and Dr John Campbell from the University of Bath's Department for Health, considers the effect of exercise on our immune function.Over the last four decades, many studies have investigated how exercise affects the immune system. 

- It is widely agreed that regular moderate intensity exercise is beneficial for immunity, but a view held by some is that more arduous exercise can suppress immune function, leading to an 'open-window' of heightened infection risk in the hours and days following exercise.In a benchmark study in 2018, this 'open window' hypothesis was challenged by Dr Campbell and Dr Turner. 

- They reported in a review article that the theory was not well supported by scientific evidence, summarising that there is limited reliable evidence that exercise suppresses immunity, concluding instead that exercise is beneficial for immune function.They say that, in the short term, exercise can help the immune system find and deal with pathogens, and in the long term, regular exercise slows down changes that happen to the immune system with ageing, therefore reducing the risk of infections.In a new article, published this month, leading experts, including Dr Turner and Dr Campbell, debated whether the immune system can change in a negative or positive way after exercise, and whether or not athletes get more infections than the general population. 

- The article concludes that infections are more likely to be linked to inadequate diet, psychological stress, insufficient sleep, travel and importantly, pathogen exposure at social gathering events like marathons -- rather than the act of exercising itself.Author Dr James Turner from the Department for Health at the University of Bath explains: "Our work has concluded that there is very limited evidence for exercise directly increasing the risk of becoming infected with viruses. 

- Provided it is carried out in isolation -- away from others -- then regular, daily exercise will help better maintain the way the immune system works -- not suppress it. 

- "Co-author, Dr John Campbell added: "People should not fear that their immune system will be suppressed by exercise placing them at increased risk of Coronavirus. 

- Provided exercise is carried out according to latest government guidance on social distancing, regular exercise will have a tremendously positive effect on our health and wellbeing, both today and for the future. 

- "Regular moderate intensity aerobic exercise, such as walking, running or cycling is recommended, with the aim of achieving 150 minutes per week. 

- Longer, more vigorous exercise would not be harmful, but if capacity to exercise is restricted due to a health condition or disability, the message is to 'move more' and that 'something is better than nothing'. 

- Resistance exercise has clear benefits for maintaining muscles, which also helps movement.At this current time in particular, the researchers underline the importance of maintaining good personal hygiene when exercising, including thoroughly washing hands following exercise. 

- To give the body its best chance at fighting off infections, they suggest in addition to doing regular exercise, people need to pay attention to the amount of sleep they get and maintain a healthy diet, that is energy balanced to account for energy that is used during exercise. 

- They hope that this debate article will lead to a wave of new research exploring the beneficial effects of exercise on immune function.Exercise training better than weight loss for improving heart function in type 2 diabetesUniversity of Leicester (UK), March 31, 2020Researchers in Leicester have shown that the function of the heart can be significantly improved in patients with type 2 diabetes through exercise.The study, which was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and conducted at the NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) - a partnership between Leicester's Hospitals, the University of Leicester and Loughborough University - also showed that a low-energy diet did not alter heart function in the same patient group.Dr Gaurav Gulsin, a BHF Clinical Research Fellow at the University of Leicester, trainee heart doctor, and a lead author of the study, said: "Heart failure is one of the most common complications in people with type 2 diabetes, and younger adults with type 2 diabetes already have changes in their heart structure and function that pose a risk of developing heart failure. 

- We wanted to confirm the abnormalities in the structure and function of the heart in this patient population using the latest scanning techniques, and explore whether it is possible to reverse these through exercise and/or weight loss. 

- Participants underwent echocardiography and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to confirm early heart dysfunction, and exercise tests to measure cardiovascular fitness. 

- They were then randomised into one of three groups: routine care, supervised aerobic exercise training, or a low-energy meal replacement programme. 

- Thirty six healthy volunteers were enrolled as a control group.The study found that patients who followed the supervised exercise programme had significantly improved heart function compared with the control group, and had also increased their exercise capacity. 

- He said: "Through this research we have shown that lifestyle interventions in the form of regular exercise training may be important in limiting and even reversing the damage to heart structure and function seen in younger adults with type 2 diabetes. 

- "It may seem obvious, but if we can empower patients with type 2 diabetes to make changes to their daily routines through exercise and healthy eating, we may help them reduce the risk of heart failure and even early death. 

- In addition, nearly 1 in 5 patients in the exercise arm of the study did not complete all 36 sessions, which may limit its application in future clinical practice.Vitamin D proven to protect against respiratory infectionsQueen Mary University (UK), March 29, 2020Adequate vitamin D levels are critical to immune system health and a range of other health areas. 

- In fact, science clearly suggests that maintaining proper levels can help us to avoid dementias like, Alzheimer’s disease and cancer.This essential vitamin is best produced by exposing the body to the sun and can help to keep our muscles and bones healthy.A new meta-analysis has confirmed that proper supplementation has a protective effect against colds and flu. 

- Keep in mind, 25-hydroxyvitamin D supplementation is especially important in geographic regions that are prone to lots of rain and cloudy weather, as residents of these areas will likely not receive adequate sunlight for its production.In addition to a stronger immune system and support of numerous aspects of physical health, 25-hydroxyvitamin D also helps to regulate blood sugar and mood. 

- (especially if the dairy is highly-processed)When it comes to supplementation, amounts as high as 10,000 IU per day have been taken to raise blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D; however, the average ideal dose can range from 2,000 to 6,000 IU per day depending upon your current health status. 

- Your best bet is to get a blood test to determine your current status, then ask your doctor to help you determine the best course of action.Vitamin B12 measurements across neurodegenerative disordersUniversity of California, March 30, 2020According to news reporting out of the University of California by NewsRx editors, research stated, “Vitamin B12 deficiency causes a number of neurological features including cognitive and psychiatric disturbances, gait instability, neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of California: “Clinical recognition of B12 deficiency in neurodegenerative disorders is more challenging because it causes defects that overlap with expected disease progression. 

- We sought to determine whether B12 levels at the time of diagnosis in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) differed from those in patients with other neurodegenerative disorders. 

- We performed a cross-sectional analysis of B12 levels obtained around the time of diagnosis in patients with PD, Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). 

- "According to our research, postmenopausal women had more depressive symptoms than peri- or premenopausal women," says doctoral student Dmitriy Bondarev from the Gerontology Research Center and Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, University of Jyväskylä, Finland. 

- Mental well-being and physical activity were self-reported by the participants.Complementary and integrative medical treatment interventions for increased intestinal permeabilityAustralian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine, April 1, 2020Researchers from Australia explored the treatment interventions complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) practitioners use to manage an emerging health condition like increased intestinal permeability (IP), as well as the association these methods have on the observed time to resolve the condition. 

- Their findings were published in The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine.The researchers conducted a cross-sectional survey of Australian naturopaths, nutritionists, and Western herbal medicine practitioners through the Practitioner Research and Collaboration Initiative (PRACI) network.They considered the frequencies and percentages of the treatment methods, including chi-square analysis, to examine the associations between treatment methods and observed time to resolve IP.The researchers reported that 36 CIM practitioners responded to the survey. 

- These practitioners use a multi-modal approach for the management of IP.Almost 93 percent of the respondents use three or more categories of treatment interventions, namely, nutritional, herbal, dietary and lifestyle interventions.The researchers also found that the main treatments prescribed for IP include:Zinc (85.2 percent)Multi-strain probiotics (77.8 percent)Vitamin D (75 percent)Glutamine (73.1 percent)Turmeric (73.1 percent)Saccharomyces boulardii (70.4 percent)They also reported that CIM practitioners ask patients with IP to reduce their intake of alcohol (96.3 percent), gluten (85.2 percent) and dairy products (75 percent).In addition, CIM practitioners frequently advise evaluation of antibiotics (75 percent) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (73.1 percent) prescriptions.They observed that IP takes longer to resolve when patients do not reduce the intensity of their exercise.The researchers concluded that their findings align with pre-clinical research, suggesting that CIM practitioners prescribe in accordance with published literature. 

- They also recommend that CIM practitioners use numerous integrative treatment methods for the management of IP.Burgers, other foods consumed at restaurants, fast food outlets, cafeterias, associated with higher levels of phthalatesGeorge Washington University. 

- March 29, 2020Dining out more at restaurants, cafeterias and fast-food outlets may boost total levels of potentially health-harming chemicals called phthalates in the body, according to a study out today. 

- Phthalates, a group of chemicals used in food packaging and processing materials, are known to disrupt hormones in humans and are linked to a long list of health problems.The study is the first to compare phthalate exposures in people who reported dining out to those more likely to enjoy home-cooked meals. 

- "This study suggests food prepared at home is less likely to contain high levels of phthalates, chemicals linked to fertility problems, pregnancy complications and other health issues," says senior author Ami Zota, ScD, MS, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at Milken Institute School of Public Health (Milken Institute SPH) at the George Washington University. 

- "Lead author Julia Varshavsky, PhD, MPH, at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health, Zota, and their colleagues used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 

- The National Academies of Sciences has weighed in twice on phthalates—first in a 2008 report, they recommended using cumulative risk assessments in order to estimate the human health risk posed by this class of chemicals; and then in 2017 with a report finding that certain phthalates are presumed to be reproductive hazards to humans.Many products contain phthalates, including take-home boxes, gloves used in handling food, food processing equipment and other items used in the production of restaurant, cafeteria and fast food meals. 

- "At the same time, phthalate contamination of the food supply also represents a larger public health problem, one that must be addressed by policymakers. 

- "Possible adverse health outcomes associated with anti-androgen exposure are abnormal reproductive function, male infertility and disrupted testicular and prostate development," said lead researcher Phum Tachachartvanich, Ph.D., of the University of California, Davis in Davis, Calif.Hydraulic fracturing technology has significantly improved the yield of oil and natural gas extraction from unconventional sources. 

- "The widespread use of fracking has led to concerns of potential negative impacts on both the environment and human health," Tachachartvanich said. 

- Consequently, even if infected by COVID-19 or another respiratory virus, our immune system can be strengthened naturally to dramatically reduce the risks of serious complications.At the moment, the primary dispensers of information about the pandemic is the White House, the CDC, the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and the World Health Organization (WHO). 

- The mainstream media and state and local health officials have been completely relying upon comments and reports from these sources to inform or education the public. 

- In China, Europe, Japan, and the US there are tens of thousands or more physicians and medical professionals using alternative modalities such as nutritional therapy, naturopathy and Traditional Chinese Medicine to further protect patients from respiratory infections alongside or to complement conventional drug protocols.Unfortunately none of these non-conventional doctors and professionals are being asked for their consultation nor is the large body of scientific literature that supports their regimens being recommended. 

- We are referring to studies published in respected journals and research conducted by important centers of medical investigation. 

- The question, therefore, is why has a contingent of people on the frontlines of prevention and complementary approaches to health been completely marginalized from the community of so-called "experts" who dominate the voices in the media?Therefore we want to share simple natural ways to protect your respiratory system and lungs during this stressful period. 

- None of this information is folk tales but rather it is based on research found in the National Library of Medicine and other professional medical sources.Unfortunately, being cooped up indoors for long extended periods of time has its own health risks. 

- Other methods include steam therapy (inhaling water vapor) and exercise to clear airways and drain mucus from the bronchia.There are also plenty of foods, herbs and even supplements that can protect the lungs and keep the nasal and respiratory passages clear. 

- Water is absolutely essential for maintaining health lungs since dry lungs result in irritation that increases the risks for infection. 

- A study out of St. George's Hospital Medical School in London followed over 2,500 individuals between the ages of 45 and 59. 

- Among the various vitamins and foods consumed, Vitamin E and apples were the most effective for slowing the decline in lung function. 

- For people with a history of asthma, apples, which are rich in flavonoids, are inversely linked with asthma, decreased bronchial hypersensitivity, and positively improved general pulmonary health.Celery contains two important antioxidants -- apigenin and luteolin -- that have both been associated with reducing inflammation associated with our nasal passages and lungs. 

- Of course it is important to know whether or not you have a rare allergy to celery itself.In an earlier article, we reported on the health benefits of nitric oxide as a signaling molecule to strength our immune system's response to invasion. 

- Beets are one important food that protects these cells to maintain the health of our entire respiratory system. 

- A study of 1,000 adults conducted by the medical school at Kyung Hee University in South Korea found that participants who drank two cups of green tea per day had better respiratory function than those who didn't drink any. 

- It is our opinion that following this guideline along with getting sufficient outdoor exposure, exercise, reducing sources of toxicity in the home and proper ventilation, and drinking green tea and supplementing with quercetin, Vitamins C and D and other foods rich in antioxidants is a very simple and effective way of sustaining maximal lung health to get us through the pandemic.

- It is also forcing us to pay attention to the fundamental basics for becoming responsible for our own health. 

- These very basic principles are the same ones that may have saved countless lives in the past from avoidable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer and other infectious disease outbreaks. 

- Hopefully as a people and as a nation we will emerge wiser and act more proactively in the future from the lessons learned during this crisis.However, our ability to evolve beyond our limited perceptions of ourselves, our personal health and the successes and failures of America's health system are dependent upon the information we receive. 

- If what we are being told by those in authority is inaccurate or patently false, such as Donald Trump's chloroquine drug as "a gift from God" to treat coronavirus infections or prescribing HIV retroviral drugs without clearly stating these drugs' serious health warnings, then the citizenry remains in a daze of ignorance and uninformed. 

- Panic in turn brings forth its own set of economic, social and personal problems.As we follow the events unfolding both in the US and globally, it is understandable that the medical community continues to be very perplexed on many issues. 

- It is not a good sign when Oxford University made the decision to cease relying on the World Health Organization's coronavirus data because of the consistency in errors. 

- Throughout the world, nations' health ministries rely on WHO's reports to develop their own strategies. 

- In the wake of our habitual unpreparedness, numerous people suffer.So as the nation applauds Dr. Anthony Fauci at the CDC and continues to drink the kool aid served by the mainstream press to have us believe our federal health agencies are heroically on top of the situation, we must ask why the US was so far behind the eight ball in the first place. 

- And in the absence of a federal health system that should be worthy of a developed nation, how can people better protect their personal health from infection and potential inflammatory complications?Aside from all the uncertainty and confusion, even among our top health experts, one thing we can feel certain about: those at greatest risk have other pre-existing medical conditions. 

- Unfortunately, our health officials have not provided any clear demographic statistics of those who have died in the US so far. 

- What percent had pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular or autoimmune illnesses? 

- The condition of a person's immune system is critical for fighting any infectious disease, not just the coronavirus. 

- Over 99 percent (99.2%) of Italians who died from either the virus or a subsequent co-infection such pneumonia, had a pre-existing health condition. 

- Almost 50 percent had three or more conditions, the most common being high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease. 

- All those who had died under 40 years of age were "males with serious existing medical conditions. 

- Fauci recently stated during a White House meeting, "Now we have to look at the young people who are getting seriously ill from the European cohort and make sure that it isn't just driven by that they have underlying conditions because... all bets are off no matter how young you are if you have an underlying, serious medical condition." 

- And so far, our government and state health officials have been completely ignoring this critical factor as one solution to lessen the serious viral infections.So if the World Health Organization warns that the US "may become the next center for the coronavirus pandemic," should we be that surprised? 

- Since then we have learned about other natural approaches to further protect ourselves.Recently Zhejiang University School of Medicine, one China's oldest and most prestigious universities, publicly released its "Handbook of CoVid-19 Prevention and Treatment" worldwide. 

- The medical researchers identify many important clues that are barely found in English speaking literature. 

- For example the report notes the importance of nutrition and the use of probiotics to strengthen infected patients' microbiome. 

- Dr. Sara Akerstrom and colleagues at the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control and the Karolinska Institute discovered that nitric oxide "specifically inhibits the replication cycle of SARS CoV, most probably during the early stages of infection." 

- One large study by Japan's National Defense Medical College Research Institute, published in the Journal of Molecular Sciences, recommended that Japanese healthcare workers take nanosilver to protect them from viruses including coronavirus. 

- Then a joint study by Deakin University in Australia and Osaka University in Japan found that colloidal silver significantly protected cells from H3N2 flu infection and prevented viral growth in the lungsBOTANICALSAstragulusIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), coronaviral infections belong to a specific epidemic disease category. 

- The US Department of Agriculture's Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory found it inhibits avian flu viruses.Jinlin Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China conducted a study published in the journal Microbiological Pathology that concluded"Astragulus exhibits antiviral properties that can treat infectious bronchitis caused by [avian] coronavirus"A month ago, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine completed an analysis of previous research looking at the benefits of Chinese herbal formulas against the SARS coronavirus and H1N1 flu (swine flu). 

- Earlier in February, researchers at Beijing Children's Hospital at the Capital Medical University provided a thorough overview of recommended diagnostic procedures and treatments for specific symptoms witnessed in the current Covid19 infections that included both allopathic and traditional Chinese medicine. 

- Licorice's main antiviral compounds are known as glycyrrhizins (GL).Japan's National Institute of Infectious Disease reported GL's effectiveness against coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as Epstein Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus. 

- After the deadly SARS outbreak in 2012, virologists at Frankfurt University Medical School investigated several antiviral compounds to treat patients admitted with SARS coronavirus infections. 

- The scientists concluded that "Our findings suggest that glycyrrhizin should be assessed for treatment of SARS." 

- That study was published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry. 

- One of the better studies came out of National Sun Yat Sen University and the China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan in 2019. 

- One advantage of olive leaf is that it is highly bioavailable to the body's cells.There are almost 10,000 studies in the National Institutes of Health literature database referring to OLE, olive leaf, and olive oil, most with respect to its strong antioxidant and anticancer properties. 

- Therefore might olive leaf extract contribute to the treatment for this new coronavirus strain?Oregano OilOregano possesses a compound called carvacrol that has been shown to be antiviral. 

- Additionally, according to a study out of Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health, the incubation period is estimated at 5.1 days for being infected and capable of infecting others without displaying symptoms. 

- But there is no mention in the medical community nor the mainstream media about what we can do to strengthen our immune system.Yes, a high quality 99% barrier mask is important, especially if worn in a crowded environment. 

- Therefore these natural solutions too should be considered as a viable and effective recourse to lessen this pandemic's fatal effects.Additional TipsAlthough supplementing our diets and strengthening our immune systems at this time is especially important, we must not neglect our physical health and mind. 

- Beside having the opportunity to transition to a healthy plant based diet, increasing our exercise is crucial and taking time to meditate. 

- To return to maximal health, exercise for a minimum of 2 and half hours per week, and meditate 30 minutes daily to de-stress. 

- All of these suggestions are supported in the peer-reviewed medical literature. 

- This is not folk medicine or social gossip.Final ThoughtOne immediate hard lesson we are learning is that the US government has no noteworthy competence in dealing with national health crises.

Antioxidant treatment in acute ischemic stroke may delay the onset of Alzheimer's dementiaClinical Muncipal Hospital (Romania), March 17, 2020Currently we are facing a dementia epidemic, with estimations showing that by 2050 approximately 131 million people will be affected. 

- Because the common forms of dementia occur in the elderly, delaying the onset or worsening of the cognitive impairment could translate into a significant reduction of the incidence of the disease. 

- Estimations have shown that of the huge number of cases expected by 2050, roughly 23 million could be avoided if the onset of the disease could be delayed by 2 years. 

- Despite the ambition to identify a disease modifying therapy or a cure for dementia by 2025 set by the G8 dementia summit in 2013, the findings so far are not very encouraging.To date there is growing evidence of the association of vascular risk factors like hypertension, high cholesterol levels or diabetes mellitus with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. 

- From the study of Saver published in 2006 we know that "each hour in which treatment fails to occur the brain loses as many neurons as it does in 3.6 years of normal aging".These neuronal losses occur through ischemic necrosis in the core of the infarction, but may be prolonged up to 2 weeks after the ischemic insult in the penumbral area surrounding the ischemic core through another type of cell loss, namely apoptosis. 

- As the authors pointed out in a previous study, oxidative stress increases mainly after cardioembolic stroke, followed by lacunar stroke, with a less prolonged burst of generation of oxidative species following thrombotic stroke.There is a considerable overlap between the oxidative stress-induced pathogenesis in ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease including mitochondrial dysfunction (the mitochondria being the main generators of energy in the cells), calcium overload of the cells, activation of different destructive enzymes by the excess intracellular calcium, aberrant gene transcription and expression, induction of autophagy (a process by which cells degrade their own cytoplasmic proteins and organelles) and activation of inflammatory responses.Despite promising results of antioxidant molecules in animal models of ischemic stroke, human clinical trials were disappointing possibly due to late administration and incorrect selection of patients. 

- Unfortunately, NA1 interacted with alteplase, limiting its efficiency in patients who were also thrombolysed.Antioxidants have been evaluated also in patients suffering from degenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease included, with promising results in animal models but inconclusive results in clinical trials. 

- If this hypothesis would be proven the reason for reaching antioxidant treatment in acute ischemic stroke would be reinforced. 

- Nonetheless, in view of the high incidence and prevalence of the disease, the results could be rewarding.Spinach supplements can enhance athletic performanceFreie University (Germany), March 17, 2020Supplements that contain an anabolic compound from spinach should be in the list of prohibited substances in sports, according to a recent study. 

- They propose that ecdysterone be classified under “other anabolic agents,” the use of which is banned in any competition.Adding turmeric to green tea enhances its health benefits, study findsRajarshi Shahu College of Pharmacy (India), March 17, 2020Today, numerous studies on the beneficial properties of green tea credit it with possessing a variety of antioxidant compounds. 

- EGCG is said to reduce inflammation, aid in weight loss and even support heart health by lowering blood cholesterol levels. 

- However, its low bioavailability decreases its potential, especially in promoting heart health.To solve this problem, the researchers first extracted EGCG from green tea leaves and confirmed its presence using chromatography. 

- At the end of the treatment, the rats that received the mixture had lower cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, LDL and VLDL levels than the rats given GTE alone.Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that curcumin can enhance intestinal permeability and consequently the absorption of EGCG. 

- Hence, EGCG-curcumin formulations can be a promising nutraceutical for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.Vitamin D boosts chances of walking after hip fractureRutgers University, March 16, 2020Senior citizens who are not vitamin D deficient have a better chance of walking after hip fracture surgery, according to a Rutgers-led study.The findings in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggest that vitamin D deficiency could limit mobility in older adults, said senior author Sue Shapses, a professor in the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.Shapses suggests that older adults take 800 international units (IU), equivalent to 20 micrograms, of vitamin D daily to prevent deficiency. 

- Vitamin D is important for bone health, and people get it through some foods, exposure to the sun and vitamin pills. 

- "An important next step is learning how vitamin D affects mobility," said Shapses, who is also an adjunct professor in the Department of Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and director of the Center for Human Nutrition, Exercise and Metabolism at Rutgers' New Jersey Institute for Food, Nutrition, and Health. 

- Women fall more frequently than men, experiencing three-quarters of hip fractures, and the number of fractures is likely to rise as the population ages, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Regaining mobility after a hip fracture is important for full recovery and to reduce the risk of death. 

- But vitamin D deficiency is associated with reduced mobility after surgery to repair a hip fracture.The multi-site study of patients 65 or older in the United States and Canada examined the influence of vitamin D levels in blood serum and nutrition on mobility. 

- While poor nutrition is associated with reduced mobility 30 days after surgery, that factor was not statistically significant. 

- "This matters because vitamin D deficiency and malnutrition are common disorders in elderly patients with hip fractures and often occur together since both are complications of poor nutrition," Shapses said.Previous studies have shown that taking 800 IU of vitamin D a day can prevent falling and fractures. 

- It has also recently been linked to the risk of Alzheimer's disease.In a study published today in the journal Brain, a team of researchers at the University of Cambridge set out to examine whether neuroinflammation also occurs in other forms of dementia, which would imply that it is common to many neurodegenerative diseases.The team recruited 31 patients with three different types of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 

- "This, together with the fact that it is known to play a role in Alzheimer's, suggests that inflammation is part of many other neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. 

- "Intestinal flora dysbiosis aggravates cognitive dysfunction associated with neuroinflammation in heart failureHarbin Medical University (China), March 15, 2020According to news reporting from Harbin, People’s Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, “Cognitive dysfunction after heart failure (HF) is characterized by neuroinflammation, which plays an important role in the occurrence and development of cognitive dysfunction. 

- Recent studies have shown that an intestinal flora imbalance may also trigger neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease.”The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, “The present study was designed to reveal that intestinal flora dysbiosis caused by HF aggravates neuroinflammation-associated cognitive impairment. 

- In addition, probiotic administration considerably improved the impaired spatial memory in HF rats.”According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “We conclude that intestinal flora dysbiosis plays a potential role in aggravating the impaired cognition associated with neuroinflammation and that these effects may be attenuated by probiotics.”Cellular stress makes obese mothers have obese babiesFrench National Institute of Health and Medical Research, March 16, 2020Maternal obesity increases the risk for obesity and metabolic perturbations in their offspring, but what are the mechanisms? 

- In a new study published March 12 in the open-access journal PLOS Biology, Sebastien Bouret of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in Lille, France, and colleagues show that a key step in the process is the triggering of stress in a complex membrane system within all cells called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 

- "Interestingly, TUDCA has been approved in the United States and Europe to treat specific liver and neurodegenerative disorders, raising the possibility that the clinical use of this ER stress-relieving drug could be expanded to treatment of childhood obesity, which now affects more than 40 million children worldwide. 

- "Dietary anti-cancer compound may work by influence on cellular geneticsOregon State University, March 15, 2020Researchers have discovered one of the reasons why broccoli may be good for your health.They found that sulforaphane, a dietary compound from broccoli that's known to help prevent prostate cancer, may work through its influence on long, non-coding RNAs. 

- Scientists now believe that when these lncRNAs are dysregulated they can contribute to multiple disease processes, including cancer.Unlike many chemotherapeutic drugs that affect healthy cells as well as malignant ones and can cause undesired side effects, the control of lncRNAs may offer a new way to specifically prevent or slow the progression of malignant cells. 

- "This could be a turning point in our understanding of how cancer may be triggered and spreads," said Emily Ho, the endowed director of the Moore Family Center for Whole Grain Foods, Nutrition and Preventive Health at OSU, a professor in the College of Public Health and Human Sciences and principal investigator with the Linus Pauling Institute. 

- "In particular, this research showed that one lncRNA, called LINC01116, is upregulated in a human cell line of prostate cancer, but can be decreased by treatment with sulforaphane. 

- "We showed that treatment with sulforaphane could normalize the levels of this lncRNA," said Laura Beaver, a research associate in the Linus Pauling Institute and College of Public Health and Human Sciences, and lead author on the study. 

- "These discoveries illustrate that lncRNAs can play important roles in cancer development and may be useful targets for cancer prevention, detection and treatment. 

- One in 10 women will be affected by postnatal depression within a year of giving birth.By reducing the risk of the “baby blues”, which typically hits around three days after birth, it’s possible to reduce the risk of more serious depression.The kit included three supplements – tryptophan, tyrosine and blueberry extract.They were carefully selected by scientists at Toronto’s Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.All can compensate for a surge in the brain protein MAO-A, which happens in the early stages of postnatal depression.The same pattern is seen people with clinical depression.The protein breaks down three chemicals that help maintain mood – serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. 

- MAO-A levels peak five days after giving birth, the same time when it’s most likely a mum will succumb to postnatal depression.Trytophan – which is found in high levels in turkey – and tyrosine – found in cheese, soybeans, and meat – help boost the three chemicals.Dr Jeffrey Meyer, who lead the study, said: “Developing successful nutrition-based treatments, based on neurobiology, is rare in psychiatry.The supplements – trytophan and tyrosine and blueberry extract – produced dramatic results, stopping the “baby blues”, a precursor to full blown postnatal depression“We believe our approach also represents a promising new avenue for creating other new dietary supplements for medicinal use.”Dr Meyer and his team also tested and found the levels of trytophan and tyrosine supplements – given in higher amounts than you could get normally in your diet – did not affect a mum’s breast milk.His team gave 21 women the supplements and compared them to 20 new mums who took a placebo.They took their supplements over three days, starting three days after giving birth. 

- “Postpartum blues are common and usually resolves 10 days after giving birth, but when they are intesnse, the risk of postpartum depression increases four-fold.” He added more research is now needed to trial the supplements in a larger group of new mums.B vitamins protect epigenome from pollution effectsColumbia University, March 13 2020A trail reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals a protective effect for supplementation with B vitamins on the human epigenome:  the chemicals surrounding DNA that modify the genome and help determine the genes that are active in a cell. 

- The trial’s results suggest that B vitamins could help protect the epigenome from the detrimental effects of air pollution. 

- "The molecular foundations of air pollution's health effects are not fully understood, and the lack of individual-level preventative options represented a critical knowledge gap," noted coauthor Andrea Baccarelli, MD, PhD, who is a professor and chair of Environmental Health Sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. 

- “We showed that these effects can be prevented with B-vitamin supplementation (i.e., folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12).”
On today's episode of The Gary Null Show: Gary Null and Richard Gale speak with Ellen Brown on the topic of Corona Virus and how it is AFFECTING, everyone world wide and ways we can protect more than just our health. 

- They give no thought to what it does to our health. 

- This new network will be five times greater than the number of operative satellites in space already.The precautionary principle is intended to avoid inflicting unnecessary harm and injury in order to reduce avoidable health risks, and more importantly death. 

- It is their panacea that is fully integrated into their purpose and meaning in life.This dark and deadly side of EMF emitting technology, especially 5G, is being hidden by our multimedia system that is being paid to manufacture both consent and doubt: consent that 5G will somehow miraculously improve our lives, and doubt against the 10,000-plus studies that show 5G will be one of the greatest health and environmental risks humanity has ever faced.This month, IEEE Access published a special study out of the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in India as part of its Special Section on Antenna and Propagation for 5G. 

- Almost 70% of the world's current population is using mobile phones.Thousands of studies have been collected that indicate EMF's health risks. 

- The Indian scientists breakdown EMF's health risks into seven main headings.CancerBack in 2011, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans. 

- Nine years later, this threat has been confirmed by thousands of medical professionals. 

- Dr. Hardell, along with hundreds of other scientists and medical doctors have demanded a moratorium against 5G until further independent studies are performed to assure the industry's denials of its hazards can be confirmed.In a study published in the August 2018 issue of Journal of Medical Imaging and Health Informatics, after an extensive review and analysis of the medical literature researchers concluded that "incidence of cancer cases was remarkably higher among people who resided in 400 meters from mobile antennas, in comparison to those who lived further away. 

- In 2016, the Europa EM-EMF guideline found "strong evidence that long-term exposure to certain EMFs is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers, Alzheimer’s disease, and male infertility…Common EHS (electromagnetic hypersensitivity) symptoms include headaches, concentration difficulties, sleep problems, depression, lack of energy, fatigue, and flu-like symptoms.”Populations living within 350 meters of a 850 MHz, 1500 watt cell phone tower in Netanya, Israel experienced a 400 percent cancer increase (i.e., carcinoma of the breast, ovary, lung, kidney, bone, and Hodgkin’s disease)Pregnancy and InfertilityThe science is conclusive that EMF's erratic pulses from mobile phones induces oxidative stress that damage testicular tissues and decreases sperm quality and motility. 

- Prof John Aitken at the University of Newcastle has shown that sperm exposed to mobile phone radiation revealed a 300 percent increase in mitochondrial damage.We need to take the precautionary principle at heart when animals studies confirm the serious health risks. 

- The high pitch sounds associated with this illness disturb normal sleep patterns and in more serious cases interfere with normal cognitive abilities and has even led to suicides, according to a study conducted by the Medical University of Vienna and published in the British Medical Journal. 

- According to a study published in the journal Physics in Medicine and Biology, children have especially high bone marrow conductivity, greatly increasing EMF absorption.Consequently, a study out of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute looking at 7th through 9th graders found that cumulative phone use decreased memory.Blood-Related DisordersEven very low intensity EMF frequencies -- much lower than what 5G will expose us to -- interrupt the blood brain barrier that hinders toxic chemicals from disrupting various tissues, including the brain. 

- An article in Reviews of Environmental Health introduces a new observed disorder -- "Chronic multi-system illness” (CMSI). 

- This conclusion was arrived at independently by Vienna Medical University in Austria and Carl Blackman at the University of North Carolina, published in the journal Pathophysiology. 

- Since 1997, secondary insurance providers have refused to cover health damages due to wireless radiation. 

- This is not simply the words of independent 5G critics in the medical profession announcing health warnings. 

- On its website, we find "the FDA does not review the safety of radiation-emitting consumer products such as cell phones and similar wireless devices before they can be so, as it does with new drugs or medical devices.... 

- Devra Davis is the founder of the Environmental Health Trust and a Visiting Professor of Medicine at the Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School and a Visiting Professor of Medicine at Ondokuz Mayis University, Turkey. 

- There is a growing consensus in the scientific and medical community that 5G will usher an epidemic of disease never before witnessed in human history. 

- Nevertheless, if the past and current research on EMF's adverse effects on health and the environment during the past 50 years are any indication, we are entering a new epoch of disease and neurological disorders that humanity is completely unprepared to handle.

- Patients rarely question the diagnosis or prescribed treatment of their cardiologist, oncologist, urologist, etc. 

- Nor do we question the accuracy and objectivity of mainstream medical journalists or news anchors reporting on health issues. 

- It is presumed that the sacred trust we project upon the authority and veneration of so-called “experts” should cancel out honest scrutiny and critical thinking.The logic behind this is simple and should be self evident, not just in the medical profession but for any field or discipline. 

- But in the real world, these hierarchical differences of power and authority are more mythology than reality.One glaring example of a non-expert who has been uncritically praised and lifted as an authoritative voice for medical orthodoxy is former psychiatrist Stephen Barrett.

- Tart cherry supplements and juice can help lower heart disease and Type 2 diabetes risk, advise researchers. 

- Dear Dr. Gupta,After watching you investigate health issues on CNN for the past 20+ years, I find it necessary to contact you about a situation related to CDC mandated vaccinations that has become very disturbing to me. 

- On that basis alone, no one should be required to subject themselves to vaccination.Because there is no requirement for the pharmaceutical industry or the CDC to publish the findings from the data in the VAERS database, doctors and pediatricians do not have access to information such as, symptoms, in order to quickly diagnose and treat illness due to a reaction to a vaccine.In a decision, the Supreme Court stated 32 times that vaccines are “unavoidably unsafe”.The studies that the FDA and the CDC require to verify the safety of new vaccines is totally inadequate by any normal medical standard.In 1986, the pharmaceutical industry lobbied to get legislation passed (1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act) that makes any manufacturer of a vaccine immune from prosecution due to harm done by its vaccinations – no matter how reckless or negligent the company was. 

- The healthcare system considers autism a disorder – not a disease. 

- They are prescribed to humans without any testing in many cases.The FDA and the CDC are not required to prove that a vaccine is effective in treating a disease. 

- They only have to show that the vaccine produces an antigen that is believed to be effective in combating a given disease. 

- Many people, such as the disease-effected or elderly people won’t even generate the desired antibody.Many vaccines only produce temporary immunity, not a life-long immunity that would be a result of a normal function of the human immune system. 

- This is why so many vaccines require “booster shots”.CNN has reported that the US government secretly spread STD’s in South America between 1946-1948 to determine if injections of penicillin would reduce the likelihood of infection from sexually transmitted disease.The Nuremberg Code specifies that it is unlawful to force or coerce someone into taking medicine, receiving a vaccine or a medical procedure that he/she does not want. 

- State governments are “partnering” with corporations to mandate that their employees be vaccinated.Doctors and Hospitals have become enforcers of government policy where their medical licenses are subject to adherence to prescribed protocols for vaccinations to infants. 

- This violates the patient/doctor relationship.The vaccine market will be worth 100 Billion US by 2025 thanks to government enforcement of its vaccination protocols.There is a concept of “Hurd Immunity” that says that if you vaccinate 95% of a population, you have created a barrier to the spread of a disease. 

- A speaker in the film says, “this has got to be one of the biggest rackets on the planet.”There have been four separate studies by the United States Government including a three year study by Congress, a one year study by the Senate, a study conducted by HHS of itself in 2008 and a study in 2018 by the Office of Research Integrity – all of which describe the vaccine division at CDC as a “cesspool of corruption” because of financial conflicts of interest between individuals that work in the vaccine division and those who work in the vaccine industry.The Gardasil vaccine – the National Institute of Health buys the patent from MERC, which is recommended by the Center of Disease Control, which is approved by the FDA and the court that will decide if that vaccine has hurt your child is the Heath Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). 

- All four of those sister agencies are part of Health and Human Services Department. 

- Their value is knowing how to lie using data as a tool for deception.The CDC has little technical legitimacy, since they are immune from having to publicly prove anything, yet they have the ability to impose “medical martial law” on the population.The documentary states that corporately owned media outlets are “not allowed” to report the fraud that is going on in the vaccine industry. 

- A CDC researcher had found that if a child were given a vaccination of Thimerosal within the first six months of birth, they were 7.6 times more likely to contract Autism than if not.Recent studies found that the nations that required the most infant vaccines suffered the highest mortality and nations that required the least vaccines had the least infant mortality.Last year the pharmaceutical industry gave over $60 million in political contributions.After reading this list of highlights, it would seem inconceivable that you would not have professional interest in reviewing the film itself.Kindest regards,John Schimenti

To Save the Planet and Sustain Your Health, Become a VeganOn Sunday evening, the Academy Award recipient Joachim Phoenix gave an extraordinary speech. 

- There are hundreds of reliable peer-reviewed studies supporting the benefits of a Mediterranean or a healthy plant-based diet for relieving and treating disease, including a variety of cancers. 

- On the other side of the equation, there are equally many studies that have determined unhealthy foods such as meat contributing to cancer,  heart disease, diabetes, obesity and inflammatory illnesses such as arthritis. 

- If we focus solely upon health issues, then disease and premature death are on the side of a meat-based lifestyle.Some people care more about the environment than they do about themselves. 

- It only takes about 3.5 percent of the population to support any given cause in order to change the course of policymakers.Important Vegan Facts to ConsiderWhat if I told you that going on an incredibly delicious, cost-effective plant-based diet would:Reduce your risk of all cancers by 50%,Decrease your chance of developing diabetes by 50% and eliminate Type 2 diabetes,Drop your chance of developing heart disease by 24%, reduce your chance of dying from heart disease by 29% or if you have heart disease, reduce future cardiac events by 73%,Lower your risk of colon cancer by 40%,Have an 80% chance of reducing arthritis symptoms in less than four weeks,Assist you in losing a minimum of one pound of body weight per week until you reach your goal, and without exercising (although I recommend exercising too),Significantly lower high blood pressure and unhealthy cholesterol levels,Double the number of natural “killer cells” in the body, thereby increasing the strength of your immune system,Significantly lessen your likelihood of being obese,Help you have leaner, healthier children,Improve your sleep, your sex life, and your complexion,Give you more energy than you have ever had, and, most importantly, add quality years onto your lifeIn addition, despite the lack of action in the US, there are nations and major cities around the world taking climate change seriously. 

- Not only is it affordable, but a vegan lifestyle will also strengthen our physical and mental health to face the challenges ahead. 

- You would also end your contribution through dietary choices to depleting rainforests, eroding topsoil, world hunger, and global warming, while standing for cleaner air, cleaner water in aquifers, rivers, lakes, and oceans, cleaner drinking water, the humane treatment of animals and humans, and the health of any number of species and the planet too.Would you want to hear about it?

Science Based Medicine: A Swamp of Medical BuffooneryRichard GaleProgressive Radio Network, February 6, 2020Every religion, large institution, political party and scientific and social discipline has its lunatic fringe. 

- Within the practice of medicine in the 21st century the aberrant margins are the far extremes of alternative medical beliefs and the small clique of Science Based Medicine (SBM) within the conventional medical establishment. 

- While the former is completely unsupported by any credible science, the latter is plagued by rampant shortsightedness, professional bias and hubris, and outright disdain towards all medical therapies that do not fall within the purview of its worldview of uncompromising scientific reductionism.Unfortunately, despite its small following, the leading SBM voices have succeeded in having an enormous detrimental influence over the narrative of healthcare and the freedom of medical choice in the social media, including Wikipedia.The Society of Science Based Medicine is the brainchild of Dr. Steven Novella at Yale University with the loyal support of his colleagues Drs. 

- SBM blogs -- the Science Based Medicine blog, Neurologia and Respectful Insolence -- have functioned as clearing houses of opinions for the modern Skeptic organizations to source opinionated and prejudiced essays in their efforts to criticize and debunk alternative and natural medical therapies, including those that have received mainstream acceptance in the field of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). 

- In a recent article sharing his despair over the rise in CAM's popularity within the conventional medical community, he writes,"As much as I hate to admit it, at times I feel like Sisyphus, pushing the boulder up the hill only to have it roll down the other side, only to have to push it back up the hill and roll down again, over and over and over again for all eternity. 

- Does he believe he holds a prophetic mission to warn against the very bad bogey women and bogey men in the alternative and natural health communities who are determined to force upon the public vitamins, supplements, medicinal herbs, healthy diets, and alternative and natural medical therapies for personal gain? 

- Rather than allow Gorski to wallow in the self pity of his eternal fate to battle effective natural medical treatments with his quarry, might his burden be lessened by bolting the boulder on his back?Conspiratorial paranoia, scientific denialism and the lack of critical thought abound in Skeptic and SBM publications. 

- Over the years SBM authors have attacked a gluten-free diet (aside from the 1 percent of people who have Celiac disease), state licensing of acupuncturists and naturopaths, plant-based diets, nutritional therapies and the Keto Diet for mental disorders, omega-3 and other dietary supplements, antioxidants, etc. 

- In the SBM universe, with few exceptions, only pharmaceutical drugs and surgery should define the practice of medicine.Given Novella's positions noted above, it comes as no surprise that we find him serving as an Advisory Board member for the American Council on Science and Health, a pro-industry front organization with financial ties to Chevron and ExxonMobil, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, McDonalds, Bristol Myers, Proctor and Gamble, almost all of the agricultural giants including Bayer, Monsanto, DowAgra, Syngenta and tobacco companies such as Altria, Reynolds American, Phillip Morris and British American Tobacco. 

- Surely this is the real quackery of junk science that poses the greatest threat to public health and costing the lives of millions of the planet's citizens.Least worrisome is SBM's reliance upon cherry-picked science (often infected by corporate conflicts of interest), its scientific arguments against CAM (largely irrational and based upon the flawed theory of "plausibility"), and an ideological belief system (i.e., Skepticism) that strictly adheres to a dominant medical institution that we now find cracking at the seams. 

- And unless SBM receives imperial decree, there is very little chance this fringe movement will gain much popularity nor have any constructive  impact within the medical community.The Skeptic proponents of SBM seem determined to prevent medicine from evolving beyond its current reductionist, materialist perspective. 

- Consequently Skeptics are the strongest opponents of the growing trend in CAM therapies entering medical school curriculums and being offered in hospitals and clinical settings. 

- In recent years, the American Medical Students Association has sponsored an Integrative Medicine Day. 

- Novella and Gorski have damned this effort as "quackademic medicine" and have published articles excoriating the study of natural health treatments as a threat to science. 

- Writing for the New York Times, health journalist David Freedman called these medical Skeptics "prickly anti-alternative medicine warriors. 

- "However what is far more vexing is SBM's religious zealotry to discredit any and all alternative medical practices it does not agree with. 

- In his article "NCCIH Surveys Physicians on Their Recommendations of 'Complementary Health Approaches,' with Depressing Results," he opines over a press release by the NIH's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health that reported,"More than half of office-based physicians recommend at least one complementary health approach to their patients, according to a new analysis of data from a nationally representative survey. 

- In addition, female physicians recommended every complementary health approach at a higher rate than male physicians except for chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation. 

- It is intellectual alchemy that only unveils a deep seated callowness and animosity towards natural health and those who practice it. 

- Gorksi states that it bothers him "that so many physicians recommend vitamins and supplements," and it bothers him more "that so many physicians recommend acupuncture (22.4%), homeopathy (12.6%), and naturopathy (10.4%)." 

- "And the more I read SBM articles and these lengthy diatribes attacking the advances in alternative health, the more I realize that Gorski, Novella, et al. 

- Expect it to be used to argue how popular CAM is, how many doctors accept it, and thus to argue to policymakers and insurance companies that CAM should be reimbursable by government and private health insurance plans. 

- It is beyond belief that these folks fail to consider the possibility that because there are tens of thousands of alternative health practitioners serving millions of clients and patients it might have something to do with the success and effectiveness of these healing modalities. 

- I realize that this may be a difficult stunt for a Skeptic brain to comprehend, but it is a very simple and common sense possibility they may wish to consider.One among many glaring reasons why there has been a large uptick of interest in CAM, both within the medical profession and among the public, is the loss of trust in conventional medicine. 

- Instead it is a sign of the increasing failures in our medical system. 

- The federal health agencies consistently betray us by fast-tracking drugs that only shortly thereafter need to be stamped with a black box warning. 

- It hails itself as the future paradigm for evaluating medical research and to recommend best practices and treatments. 

- It is a harbinger of a medical Inquisition in its witch hunt to defame CAM practitioners and their therapies. 

- Therefore if a curse from the heavens were to fall upon America's healthcare and SBM proponents were to take control over national healthcare policies and medical schools, what might our healthcare system develop into? 

- Based upon what we can surmise and extract from the numerous articles on the SBM websites, what would be our options for freedom of medical choice? 

- How accessible would natural and alternative health therapies be for patients?Below is the list I compiled that is based upon conclusions I have drawn from SBM articles criticizing CAM therapies and other health-related topics:Defund and discontinue the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (CAM);Cease government research grants for alternative health modalities and therapies;Discontinue CAM courses in medical schools and discourage education in CAM therapies at universities;Chiropractic practice would be limited to only a small number of health indications and would not be covered by insurance plans. 

- Access to Chiropractic services, therefore, would be strictly out of pocket;Similarly, acupuncture could only be provided for a small number of medical indications and would likely require a physician's recommendation or prescription;Vitamin supplements would be removed as over-the-counter products and put into the hands of pharmaceutical companies;Many supplements, or all supplements, would require a doctor's prescription;All dietary and nutritional counseling must conform to the terribly outdated standards set forth by the American Dietetic Association, which represents mainstream pharmaceutical interests;No state could authorize Naturopathic medical board certifications, and current states that recognize Naturopathic practice would have permissions revoked;The large majority of botanical medicines would no longer be available, and likely not purchasable over the counter;The practice of homeopathy would be outlawed and the sale of homeopathic remedies would be banned;The practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Indian Ayurveda, and Energy Medicine (e.g. 

- Failure to comply could result in outrageous fines or criminal proceedings.Finally, all sites focused on alternative health, plant-based diets and natural nutrition, vaccination hesitancy, dangers of electromagnetic radiation, GMOs risks, etc would be strictly censored.Undoubtedly, this list may appear to be unduly extreme and perhaps unfair; nevertheless, I believe it accurately reflects the condemnations and hate-mongering found scattered throughout SBM and Skeptic blogs and articles. 

- Skeptics disproportionately ridicule CAM while at the same time fail to critically evaluate their own medical profession's rickety research that finds its way into peer-reviewed medical journals. 

- Furthermore, this is the same scenario subtly being promoted by the Skeptics on Wikipedia's alternative health pages who are in the habit of referencing Gorski, Novella and other SBM authors in addition to SBM's predecessor Stephen Barrett and Quackwatch.If my list is accurate, it portrays a regime that may best be defined as medical fascism. 

- In my opinion SBM should never be perceived as a champion of public health. 

- His research program is currently focused on aluminum toxicity, autoimmunity, and the differences in health outcomes between highly vaccinated and unvaccinated children. 

- A life-long biomedical researcher, he is best known for contributions to advances in medical bioinformatics, and for his three books, “Ebola: An Evolving Story,” (2016) “Cures vs. Profits: Successes in Translational Research,” (2016) and “The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism” (2017).

- The Illegitimacy of Quackwatch's Health BiasRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, December 31, 2019To the average person who is seeking high quality and reliable peer-reviewed research on any given medical topic, a Google search takes you more often than not immediately to Wikipedia. 

- However, if the information you seek concerns non-conventional medical practices that fall under the category of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, or traditional healing systems, such as Chiropractic, naturopathy, nutritional therapy, homeopathy, acupuncture, traditional Chinese and Indian Ayurveda medicine, massage therapy, etc, then you will fall into deep doubt regarding their efficacy.

Modern Skepticism: An Authentic Pseudoscience of Irrational DeceptionRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, December 10, 2019Many of us working in healthcare professions believe that medical science, in theory, is at a transformative moment. 

- At a Chicago anti-aging conference where I gave a keynote presentation on research the late neurologist and former Mt Sinai physician Dr. Martin Feldman and I conducted to naturally improve mental wellness and reduce problematic symptoms in menopausal women, there were thousands of board certified doctors and scientists in attendance, many from our most prestigious institutions. 

- These academicians and physicians, are not quacks, but represent many of our leading medical institutions such as Harvard, Chicago and Yale. 

- Moreover, the A4M has trained upwards to 150,000 physicians through their anti-aging certification programs, now recognized by the American Medical Association. 

- Because many physicians and researchers in the field of anti-aging medicine advocate natural hormone therapies, dietary regimens, supplemental therapies, exercise and lifestyle changes, Wikipedia editors make efforts to characterize the organization as a promoter of pseudo-science and quackery. 

- Without the science on their side, these radicalized factions, as we shall see, have resorted to malicious attacks, defamation, and acts of shaming alternative health practitioners and researchers as enemies of the public, "lunatic charlatans" and quacks. 

- And this is all permissible on Wikipedia because the evidence seems clear that the encyclopedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales espouses this faction's discriminatory philosophy.Today, more than ever, people are confused about what is true or false for issues that have an immediate impact upon their lives, health and well-being. 

- For health and medical matters, the noise is even louder. 

- Is a plant-based diet optimal for my health, or can I continue to subsist on burgers and junk food? 

- Do I need supplements to maximize my health or I am throwing money away? 

- Is this treatment my physician prescribes the best for my condition, or is there a safer and more effective alternative? 

- Wikipedia, for example, has become the leading source to find answers for medical questions. 

- But is this information reliable?Unfortunately, on health matters, we place too much unwarranted trust in sites such as the CDC, WebMD and Wikipedia. 

- Our own investigations during the past two years have shown that Wikipedia's information for many medical and health topics, especially regarding non-conventional medical or Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), is consistently misleading and often deliberately fictitious.Throughout history there have been reactionary movements and groups of individuals who have attempted to impose their personal ideologies, as an act of self-righteous defiance, upon the public in order to shape public opinion. 

- Another area is the full-spectrum dominance -- a complete control over public discourse and legislative policy -- by the private pharmaceutical complex, including our bloated for-profit insurance industry, to rule over the diagnosis and treatment of disease. 

- In short, today, our health is largely at the mercy of whatever the pharmaceutical industry offers and dictates. 

- To step outside this regime, and to act upon the freedom of health choice, therefore has to be done on one's own efforts and costs.Yet there are other specters behind pharmaceutical interests who with or without intention make efforts to undermine the pharmaceutical paradigm's competition. 

- Today, public health is being seriously threatened by an international movement, however for the most part being orchestrated in the US, that purports to be non-partisan, independent and based solely on evidence based science. 

- We can look back at history to find other extremist attempts by a medical elite to achieve institutional prominence and to extinguish its competition.In 1910, the Flexner Report was published. 

- The report was commissioned by the newly founded American Medical Association and funded by elite industrialists at the time such as Andrew Carnegie and the Rockefeller Foundation. 

- Its mission was to advance the emerging drug-based medical model in medical school curricula and to eradicate its competitors, including homeopathy, naturopathy, eclectic therapy, physical therapy, osteopathy and Chiropractic. 

- Before the Report's release, medical schools, with very few exceptions, offered most of these non-drug based natural therapies alongside manufactured medications. 

- The consequence was that over 80 percent of medical schools teaching alternative therapies were shut down. 

- For the Carnegies, Rockefellers and other industrial elite, a drug-based medical system promised enormous investment opportunities in the growing corporate drug industry to increase profits that natural medical therapies could not provide.Abraham Flexner, the Report's author and primary ringleader, may be the original radicalized Skeptic and the forefather of modern Skepticism's adversity against all non-conventional medical therapies practiced today. 

- Similar to Skeptic editors on Wikipedia, Flexner called the practitioners of these disciplines -- which he characterized as "medical sects" -- "charlatans" and "quacks." 

- Modern Skeptics are the de facto inheritors of Flexner's reactionary medical extremism.One could argue that the Flexner report was an attempt to establish a "gold standard" along the scientific lines at that time in order to create a dominant medical paradigm for the new 20th century. 

- Commenting on the long term results of Flexner's experiment, Yale Medical School professor Thomas Duffy remarked:"There was maldevelopment in the structure of medical education in America in the aftermath of the Flexner Report. 

- On the other hand, clinical caring and customized medical attention is an area in which alternative medical remedies excel. 

- According to Duke University's definition of Integrative Medicine, it is"an approach to care that puts the patient at the center and addresses the full range of physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual and environmental influences that affect a person's health. 

- Employing a personalized strategy that considers the patient's unique conditions, needs and circumstances, it uses the most appropriate interventions from an array of scientific disciplines [including natural, non-drug interventions alongside allopathic practice] to heal illness and disease and help people regain and maintain optimum health. 

- "Skepticism categorically denies the legitimacy of Duke University's claim, and this is further reinforced on Wikipedia's pages for alternative medical therapies. 

- In fact, Skepticism and Wikipedia are today's regressive and scientifically-arrested response to the new directions taking hold in the evolution of accepted medical theory, albeit still in its early stage. 

- Skeptics are not shy to voice their disdain for federal health agencies and medical schools' efforts to support effective, non-toxic and safe natural therapies into the mainstream, including naturopathy, dietetic and nutritional therapies, acupuncture, a variety of massage and mind-body therapies, stress reduction techniques (e.g., meditation, yoga, tai chi) and other ancient practices predating Flexner's purge.Nor would Skeptics support a recent World Health Organization report that confirmed Traditional and natural alternative medical systems as "an important and often underestimated health resource with many applications, especially in the prevention and management of lifestyle-related chronic diseases." 

- In addition, the WHO Director General stated that these non-conventional traditional medical practices are essential for sustaining healthcare and are a "human right. 

- "Now that modern medical error has risen to the third leading cause of premature deaths in the US, conventional medical protocols taught in medical schools across the nation can be judged as a dismal failure. 

- In addition, the public is quickly losing confidence in the medical profession. 

- Last year, a New York Times piece reported that only 34 percent of the public trust medical doctors and 25 percent trust our current healthcare system; this is an enormous decrease compared to 75 percent in 1966. 

- As for public trust in our federal health agencies, it stands at a miserable 14 percent. 

- For that very reason, the alternative medical systems the Flexner rules intended to stamp out are regaining their rightful place in healthcare and now being reincorporated into medical school curricula, hospitals and physician clinics because of their much lower risk. 

- May this be an indication that more Americans are waking up to the fact that many of the medical establishment's therapeutic promises and protocols are scientifically baseless and not dependable? 

- Are the real quacks perhaps those graduating from our medical schools after having been unknowingly fully indoctrinated by a drug-dominant paradigm? 

- It is no secret that almost every American medical school has been hijacked to a greater or lesser degree by corporate pharmaceutical interests. 

- More than ever before medical institutions depend economically on funding from our compromised federal agencies and private industry. 

- Conventional medical education has become a singular revolving door with drug companies that have deep financial interests for commanding power over every day clinical practice.As public trust continues to diminish, Skepticism has become the advance guard, the shock troops, to preserve the delusional and aberrant purity in a drug- and surgical-based medical paradigm that Flexner, Carnegie and Rockefeller hoped would become the final barometer for a national healthcare system. 

- Since Skeptics believe they represent the pinnacle of rationalism and the scientific method, many of the movement's celebrity leaders and principal organizations, Quackwatch and the Center for Inquiry, they have taken on the mission to redeem modern civilization from thousands of years of religious history, superstition and earlier traditional medical practices that rely upon botanical plants or that incorporate a more mind-body systems-theory philosophy for understanding the etiology and progression of diseases and illness.The great sociologist Ivan Illich prophesized in his book Medical Nemesis, "the medical establishment has become a major threat to health." 

- This is a system that relies more upon a barrage of manipulated science, biased and invalid trial results in medical journals, conflicts of interest, armies of Big Pharma lobbyists and false propaganda incubated within the federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services instead of honest, independent facts that best serve public welfare rather than the drug industry's coffers. 

- Furthermore the corporate media has also assumed a role in fueling this culture of medical deception in order to protect one of its major revenue bases: Big Pharma. 

- But the real facts show otherwise, notably in the trends noted above that alternative and natural practices are being increasingly accepted by conventional medical institutions. 

- In the largest national survey of its kind, researchers from UCLA and the University of California, San Diego, measured medical students’ attitudes and beliefs about CAM. 

- The survey found that 84 percent of medical students believe that conventional medicine would benefit from natural integrative and complementary beliefs, ideas and treatment modalities. 

- Seventy-seven percent felt conventional physicians who learned other complementary medical disciplines would benefit their patients. 

- The FDA adopted this expression to make the assumption that since GMOs are essentially genetically the same as their conventional originals, there are no additional human health and safety concerns for consumption. 

- It was also a strategy for the FDA not to require data to review GMO's safety on human health. 

- Of course, during the past two decades, independent researchers, such as Dr. Gilles-Eric Seralini at France's University of Caens, continue to discover clear differences in nutrient ratios, yields and serious disease risks between GMOs and their organic counterparts. 

- "As we have detailed in many previous articles, Skeptics control many if not most Wikipedia entries for alternative medicine, natural health and the paranormal. 

- Most have no medical background nor experience in healthcare. 

- "One of the hallmarks of supporting the credibility of scientific or medical information is to provide your curriculum vitae to show an author has an established level of scholarship and mastery in the field. 

- In the majority of cases what limited biographical information they provide indicates they have no knowledge or firsthand experience in the medical profession. 

- However, we are dealing with a large group of anonymous Skeptics who have in unison collaborated to hijack the encyclopedia's alternative health pages to slander, lie, propagandize their creed and mislead the public by intentionally condemning many thousands of physicians, doctors, practitioners and researchers globally who are dedicated to proving the efficacy of these non-conventional medical systems and theories. 

- Today, the federal health agencies -- the CDC and FDA as well as the USDA and EPA -- have merged and become inseparable from private or corporate interests. 

- These Skeptic groups, believing themselves to be the stalwarts of rational science, are part of the new dictatorial oligarchy that is willing to ban alternative medical practices that do not pass their personal litmus tests. 

- We should heed Russell's warning about the scientific elite, who continue to dominate and rule over the medical establishment despite the medical trends now reevaluating and accepting CAM therapies. 

- Russell tells us that medical tyrants and bureaucrats will tell us, "we are wise and good, we know what reforms the world needs; if we have the power, we shall create paradise. 

- Yet this is all part of Skepticism's and Wikipedia's efforts to further manipulate and raise the public's uncertainty and confusion so there is no other place to turn to besides a collapsing, untrustworthy corporate medical system.

- Wikipedia's Disdain Towards Alternative Medical Experts: The Case of NaturopathyRichard Gale & Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, December 3, 2019Americans are increasingly turning to Complementary and Alternative Medical (CAM) systems for their healthcare needs. 

- This has been perceived as competition by the medical establishment. 

- The reasons for this growing popularity includes the cost of conventional treatments, rising out-of-pocket expenses, serious drug adverse effects, and physician and diagnostic errors continue to plague the orthodox medical establishment. 

- More than ever people are questioning whether conventional medical treatments are as safe and effective as promised. 

- According to the federal National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, approximately 83 million American adults (38%) used some type of CAM protocol or treatment in 2018, the most popular being supplements such as Omega-3, glucosamine, coenzyme Q-10, melatonin and botanical supplements such as ginseng, ginkgo, and Echinacea. 

- In 2007, the National Health Interview Survey calculated there were approximately 354 million visits to CAM practitioners; today that figure is significantly higher as CAM enters mainstream medical practice and is gradually being covered by insurance companie. 

- In South Korea 75% of the population used a CAM treatment annually and 52% of Australians use CAM regularly. 

- These healing modalities include acupuncture, Chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy, the Chinese and Indian Ayurveda medical systems, orthomolecular and energy medicines, meditation and stress-reduction techniques, Chinese martial arts and yoga, nutritional counseling, and a wide range of massage and mind-body therapies.Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales claims to hold high standards of objectivity and balance in the content of the online encyclopedia and the integrity of his volunteer army of editors. 

- A group of individuals and organizations, collectively known as Skeptics, who assert they represent “science-based medicine” now portend to be the final arbiters of what is and is not sound medical practice. 

- However, it is our opinion the Skeptics are grossly biased, widely uneducated about CAM, and are both anti-science and anti-health.

- That is, we believe Wikipedia makes intentional efforts to dissuade the public from turning to CAM treatments to remedy their illnesses and disease. 

- Over the years it has received donations from Amgen, Astex Pharma, Biogen, Bristol Myer, Merck, Pfizer and United Health. 

- It has also received several million dollars from Alphabet (the parent company of Google), which is now a formal private pharmaceutical company partnering with Glaxo, Merck and Novartis.Vajda also singles out the Skeptics who have co-opted Wikpedia's pages and with intentional malice skew and reject the scientific data showing the efficacy and safety of these alternative medical modalities:"Wikipedia pages for Energy Psychology, Energy Medicine, acupuncture and other forms of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM), [...] are currently skewed to a negative, unscientific view of these approaches despite numerous rigorous studies in recent years demonstrating their effectiveness. 

- They clothe their objections in the language of the narrowest possible understanding of science in order to inhibit open discussion of innovation in health care. 

- Endorsements by major conventional medical associations, such as the American Psychological Association, the Association of Social Work Boards, the National Board of Certified Counselors, and  the National Association of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselors were also cited to confirm Energy Psychology's acceptance and efficacy in mainstream medicine. 

- Since 1980, Quackwatch's founder Stephen Barrett has served on the scientific advisory board of the American Council on Science and Health, a corporate front group that has been heavily criticized by the FDA and Public Citizen for providing false propaganda on products known to endanger human health and the environment, including tobacco, pesticides, BPA, genetically modified crops, junk food and high corn syrup soft drinks. 

- And according to the Center for Reiki Research, one of the major treatment modalities under Energy Medicine, the Center collaborates with 65 major American hospitals including prestigious ones such Duke University, Columbia and Yale, and Children's Hospital Boston.The article further argues that the fundamental, underlying principle of Energy Medicine and Psychology, the biofield, is bogus. 

- If this were not the case, then we believe numerous highly respected scientists and medical experts would hold membership in their organizations. 

- Skepticism represents only a tiny fraction of the scientific medical community.To support its position, the Wikipedia page cites Quackwatch, the Science Based Medicine blog, and Edzard Ernst, an influential Skeptic associated with Skepticism's flagship organization the Center for Inquiry.Under the Wikipedia heading "Emotional Freedom Techniques" (EFT), a therapeutic system widely used by practitioners of Energy Medicine and Psychology, Skeptic editors write in the introductory paragraphs:"The Skeptical Inquirer describes the foundations of EFT as "a hodgepodge of concepts derived from a variety of sources, [primarily] the ancient Chinese philosophy of chi, which is thought to be the 'life force' that flows throughout the body."

- Military Medicine, 177(9), 1015-1021.The Skeptical Inquirer is a heavily biased ideological publication that we cannot find evidence for being acknowledged by the mainstream media nor the professional scientific community as a source for objective and reliable review of alternative medicine.Attkinsson outlines several clues for identifying astroturf activities on Wikipedia's health-related pages:Frequent use of highly charged and inflammatory language such as quack, crank and conspiracy theorist to denigrate those personalities the editors hate;Avoidance of scientific facts and relying solely upon editorial commentaries to wash away any constructive and positive information about a person;A tendency to attack those who question authority, the consensus of the dominant paradigm rather than to question an authoritative position itself.Each of these characteristics are prevalent among the Skeptic editors on Wikipedia and are most pronounced on the encyclopedia's "Talk" pages. 

- This is only further evidence that we believe Wikipedia should be a source of last resort for accessing any reliable information about non-conventional medical practices that are used by the majority of the world's population.In conclusion, we ask the members of the scientific and medical communities and in particular the media to do their due diligence before they rush to judgment to censure CAM therapies. 

- If Wikipedia Skeptics were criticizing only one or several modalities within CAM's enormous field of various medical and health systems, it would be reasonable. 

- Daily every medical doctor from surgeons to psychiatrists, from oncologists to pediatricians, from cardiologists to OGYN physicians ask their patients "how do you feel" in order to gain additional insights for continuing or to redirect the treatment. 

- Therefore, we must consider the likelihood that the large majority of board-certified physicians and clinicians who have adopted CAM therapies began by relying solely upon the orthodox medical protocols they were educated in. 

- Today there is a growing number of doctors and patients using CAM because it works.What then does this say about the close-mindedness and rigid ideological beliefs of Wikipedia Skeptics who have neither the clinical experience as clinicians or as medical researchers?

- Moreover, the relationship between brain health and high blood pressure is a growing interest as researchers examine how elevated blood pressure affects the brain's blood vessels, which in turn, may impact memory, language, and thinking skills. 

- The study was published today in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 

- Vitamin E, known scientifically as alpha-tocopherol, has many biologic roles, one of which is to serve as an antioxidant, said Traber, a professor in the OSU College of Public Health and Human Sciences, and Ava Helen Pauling Professor at Oregon State's Linus Pauling Institute. 

- As the researchers note, relapse is very high, despite a host of current treatment options. 

- Because of that, the team began looking into other treatment options that might reduce the numbers of people who go back to drinking after treatment.

- (NEXT)Mouthwash Cancels Out Key Benefits of Exercise, Study FindsUniversity of Plymouth (UK), September 6, 2019Your mouthwash could have a bizarre effect on how exercise affects your body, a new study this week suggests. 

- The study found that swigging mouthwash can prevent exercise from lowering your blood pressure as it normally does. 

- According to study author Raul Bescos, a nutritional physiologist based at the University of Plymouth in the UK, his team wasn’t really interested in studying mouthwash’s effects on exercise by itself. 

- It’s been long known that exercise opens up and dilates our blood vessels, in part by getting our bodies to produce more nitric oxide. 

- But even after we’re done jogging and stop producing excess nitric oxide, our circulation is still affected, with our blood pressure remaining lower than it was for hours—a phenomenon known as post-exercise hypotension. 

- In 2009, we were repeatedly bombarded with fearmongering from the CDC and other federal health agencies about the Swine Flu (H1N1) pandemic.

Compilation of documentaries and TV appearances by Gary Null featuring natural and non-toxic treatments for AIDSBlueberry consumption good for heart: StudyUniversity of East Anglia (UK), September 3, 2019Eating 150 grams of blueberries daily reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by up to 15 per cent, claim researchers.The research team from UEA's Department of Nutrition and Preventive Medicine, Norwich Medical School, said that blueberries and other berries should be included in dietary strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease -- particularly among at-risk groups.The team investigated the effects of eating blueberries daily in 138 overweight and obese people, aged between 50 and 75, with Metabolic Syndrome. 

- "We found that eating one cup of blueberries per day resulted in sustained improvements in vascular function and arterial stiffness -- making enough of a difference to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by between 12 and 15 per cent," said co-lead, Dr Peter Curtis.Studies Show Mindfulness Can Improve Grades, Lower Stress Among Middle SchoolersMIT, September 2, 2019Mindfulness, or the process of focusing all of one’s attention on the present moment, is typically thought of as an adult hobby and often associated with meditation.

- It reduces cholesterol and triglyceride levels – both of which are associated with the risk of heart disease.In the study, the recruited 98 people, ages 30 to 65, with abnormally high levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and bad cholesterol. 

- Both groups were asked to take the treatment for 12 weeks.In their study, the researchers wrote: “The amla [gooseberry extract] has shown potential in reducing cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as lipid ratios… in dyslipidemic persons and thus has scope to treat general as well as diabetic dyslipidemia.”Soft drinks associated with risk of death in population-based study in 10 European countriesInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (France), September 4, 2019Greater consumption of soft drinks, including both sugar- and artificially sweetened, was associated with increased risk of overall death in a population-based study of nearly 452,000 men and women from 10 European countries. 

- Study authors suggest the findings support public health initiatives to limit soft drink consumption.Sleeping too much -- or too little -- boosts heart attack riskUniversity of Colorado, September 2, 2019Even if you are a non-smoker who exercises and has no genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease, skimping on sleep - or getting too much of it - can boost your risk of heart attack, according to a new University of Colorado Boulder study of nearly a half-million people.The research, published Sept. 2 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, also found that for those at high genetic risk for heart attack, sleeping between 6 and 9 hours nightly can offset that risk. 

- "This provides some of the strongest proof yet that sleep duration is a key factor when it comes to heart health, and this holds true for everyone," said senior author Celine Vetter, an assistant professor of Integrative Physiology.New study confirms the long-term benefits of a low-fat dietFindings in Journal of Nutrition show positive outcomes for cancer and other diseases in womenFred Hutchinson Cancer Center, September 4, 2019A team led by researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has identified several women's health benefits from a low-fat diet. 

- The findings, published in the September issue of the Journal of Nutrition, found a low-fat diet commensurate with an increase in fruit, vegetable and grain servings reduced death following breast cancer, slowed diabetes progression and prevented coronary heart disease.After nearly nine years of dietary change, they found that the low-fat diet did not significantly impact outcomes for these conditions. 

- However, after longer-term follow-up of nearly 20 years, researchers found significant benefits, derived from modest dietary changes emerged and persisted including:A 15-35% reduction in deaths from all-causes following breast cancerA 13-25% reduction in insulin-dependent diabetesA 15-30% reduction in coronary heart disease among 23,000 women without baseline hypertension or prior cardiovascular diseaseStudy says vitamin B6 helps people recall their dreamsUniversity of Adelaide, September 3, 2019Researchers have found that taking vitamin B6 could help people to recall their dreams.The study published in the journal -- Perceptual and Motor Skills -- included 100 participants from around Australia taking high-dose vitamin B6 supplements before going to bed for five consecutive days. 

- "Our results show that taking vitamin B6 improved people's ability to recall dreams as compared to a placebo," said research author Dr Denholm Aspy, from the University's School of Psychology.The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study saw participants taking 240mg of vitamin B6 immediately before bed.Ginseng can improve sexual dysfunction in menopausal women: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trialTabriz University Medical School (Iran), September 3, 2019According to news originating from Tabriz, Iran, research stated, “The present study was conducted to determine the effect of Ginseng on sexual function (primary outcome), quality of life and menopausal symptoms (secondary outcomes) in postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction.”“This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 62 women who were randomly assigned to the intervention/control groups using block randomization. 

- The mean total score of quality of life (AMD = -20.79, 95% CI=-25.83 to -15.75, P< 0.001) and menopausal symptoms (AMD = -8.25, 95% CI= -10.55 to -5.95, P< 0.001) were significantly lower in the treatment group than the control group. 

- Ginseng has significant effects in improving sexual function and quality of life and mitigating menopausal symptoms.”According to the news editors, the research concluded: “As a multipotent plant, Ginseng can be a suitable alternative for conventional therapies to promote the health of menopausal women.”Is Your Skin-Care Product Turning Your Skin Into Swiss CheeseUniversity of California at San Francisco, September 2, 2019Moisturizers and other products may be doing as much harm as good, especially for people with sensitive skin, according to 45 years of research on the subject, which started with complaints from his patients.The skin -- bombarded daily by our exposure to things that include sunlight and environmental toxins -- is highly effective and enduring in its role as a barrier, says Elias. 

- Anxiety And Depression: Why Doctors Are Prescribing Gardening Rather Than DrugsUniversity of Hull (UK), September 3, 2019Scientists have found that spending two hours a week in nature is linked to better health and well-being. 

- In Shetland for example, islanders with depression and anxiety may be given “nature prescriptions”, with doctors there recommending walks and activities that allow people to connect with the outdoors.Social prescriptions – non-medical treatments which have health benefits – are already used across the NHS to tackle anxiety, loneliness and depression. 

- Further investigation found the patient had vitamin B12 deficiency, low copper and selenium levels, a high zinc level, and markedly reduced vitamin D level and bone mineral density.The researchers concluded that the patient's 'junk food' diet and limited intake of nutritional vitamins and minerals resulted in the onset of nutritional optic neuropathy. 

- They suggest the condition could become more prevalent in future, given the widespread consumption of 'junk food' at the expense of more nutritious options, and the rising popularity of veganism if the vegan diet is not supplemented appropriately to prevent vitamin B12 deficiency.Researchers say vitamin B12 can inhibit a key Parkinson’s enzymeBasque Center for Biophysics (Spain), September 2, 2019A study published in the journal Cell Research suggests that it can be possible to treat hereditary Parkinson’s disease with the help of vitamin B12.The study found that an active form of vitamin B12 called AdoCbl (5’-deoxyadenosylcobalamin) could reduce the effects of dopamine loss in Parkinson’s disease caused by genetic mutations in the LRRK2 gene. 

- The finding suggested that this form of vitamin B12 could be used to develop therapies for treating Parkinson’s disease.“[This active form of vitamin B12] could be used as a basis to develop new therapies to combat hereditary Parkinson’s associated with pathogenic variants of the LRRK2 enzyme,” Iban Ubarretxena, director of the Biofisika Institute and co-author of the study, said in a statement.Not Just CBD – Cannabis Flavonoids Also Show Promise In Fighting CancerDana-Farber Cancer Institute, September 1, 2019Scientists from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard University recently discovered something that could change cancer treatment forever.In their study, Harvard researchers learned that a compound in the cannabis plant called “flavonoids” can be used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of cancer with a survival rate of only 20 percent within one year.Perhaps the most exciting discovery is that the introduction of flavonoids not only kills cancer in the pancreas, but in cancer cells found throughout the body. 

- This could mean that cannflavins may be used to treat other forms of cancer in the future.Oleocanthal-Rich Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Restores the Blood-Brain Barrier Function in MiceAuburn University, August 30, 2019According to news reporting originating in Auburnresearch stated, “Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by multiple hallmarks including extracellular amyloid (Ab) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, dysfunctional blood-brain barrier (BBB), neuroinflammation, and impaired autophagy. 

- In addition, we reported previously that OC and EVOO exhibited such effect by restoring the blood brain barrier function.According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “Thus, diet supplementation with OC-rich EVOO could provide beneficial effect to slow or halt the progression of AD.”Higher omega-3 intake could improve trial resultsOmega Quant Analytics, August 30, 2019.An article published on August 8, 2019 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that insufficient doses of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could be to blame for some trial results in which supplementation failed to substantially increase red blood cell omega-3 fatty acid levels reported as the Omega-3 Index.By analyzing data from 14 trials that examined the effects of varying doses of omega-3 fatty acids on the Omega-3 Index among a total of 1,422 men and women, Dr Jackson and colleagues developed a model equation that can be used to predict Omega-3 Index levels from a given daily dose of EPA and DHA.The authors remarked that thesefactors explained 62% of the variance in response.As an illustration, for someone with a baseline Omega-3 Index of 4%, 1750 milligrams per day of a triglyceride fish oil formula or 2500 milligrams of an ethyl ester formulation would be predicted to elevate the Omega-3 Index to 8% in 13 weeks with 95% certainty.A life of low cholesterol and BP slashes heart and circulatory disease risk by 80 per centBritish Heart Foundation, September 1, 2019Modest and sustained decreases in blood pressure and cholesterol levels reduces the lifetime risk of developing fatal heart and circulatory diseases, such as heart attack and stroke, according to research part-funded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) and supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).Researchers have found that a long-term reduction of 1 mmol/L low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or 'bad' cholesterol, in the blood with a 10 mmHg reduction in blood pressure led to an 80 per cent lower lifetime risk of developing heart and circulatory disease. 

- This combination also reduced the risk of death from these conditions by 67 per cent.The team found that even small reductions can provide health benefits. 

- A decrease of 0.3 mmol/L LDL cholesterol in the blood and 3 mmHg lower blood pressure was associated with a 50 per cent lower lifetime risk of heart and circulatory disease.Cardiovascular disease patients benefit more from exercise than healthy peopleSeoul National University (Seoul, Korea), September 2, 2019A study of nearly half a million people has found for the first time that those with heart or blood vessel problems benefit more from having a physically active lifestyle than do healthy people without cardiovascular disease (CVD).Increased physical activity reduced the risk of dying during a six-year follow-up period for people with and without CVD, but the researchers found the greatest reduction in risk was in people with CVD and this continued to reduce the more exercise they did.Researchers led by Dr Sang-Woo Jeong, a cardiologist at Seoul National University (Seoul, Korea), looked at data from a total of 441,798 people enrolled in the Korean National Health Insurance Services Health Screening Cohort, who underwent a health screening programme between 2009 and 2015 and completed surveys on physical activity. 

- The participants were followed for nearly six years, and information on deaths and causes of death were collected from the Korean National Death Index.Dr Kang said: "There may be several plausible explanations for why people with CVD benefited the most from exercise.

- "Green space is good for your mental health -- the nearer the better!University of Warwick (UK), August 20, 2019First study to demonstrate relationship between green space and mental wellbeing at an individual level published Using data from 25,518 people, the researchers show that Londoners who live within 300m of green space have significantly better mental wellbeingProximity to green space was more important than lifestyle factors such as employment, income, and general health. 

- Green space was less important for mental wellbeing in Central London and East London(NEXT)Study confirms cannabis flower is an effective mid-level analgesic medication for pain treatment University of New Mexico, August 21, 2019Using the largest database of real-time recordings of the effects of common and commercially available cannabis products in the United States (U.S.), researchers at The University of New Mexico (UNM) found strong evidence that cannabis can significantly alleviate pain, with the average user experiencing a three-point drop in pain suffering on a 0-10 point scale immediately following cannabis consumption. 

- With a mounting opioid epidemic at full force and relatively few alternative painmedications available to the general public, scientists found conclusive support that cannabis is very effective at reducing pain caused by different types of health conditions, with relatively minimal negative side effects. 

- Chronic pain afflicts more than 20 percent of adults and is the most financially burdensome health condition that the U.S faces; exceeding, for example, the combined costs of treating heart disease and cancer. 

- (NEXT)Ginkgo Extract Lowers Oxidative Stress Leading to Reduced Amyloid Aggregation in Alzheimer Disease Dalian Medical University (China), August 21, 2019According to news reporting originating from Dalian, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Abundant evidence demonstrates that oxidative stress may be not only an early event in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but also a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD. 

- Our studies showed that Ginkgo extract treatment reduced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) significantly while total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were enhanced “These findings suggest that Ginkgo extract can reduce oxidative stress by decreasing free radical and enhancing antioxidant status, further leading to reduced A aggregation; Ginkgo extract might be a potential therapeutic agent for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).”(NEXT)Low Intake of Vitamin E Accelerates Cellular Aging In Patients With Established Cardiovascular Disease University of Cordoba (Spain), August 21, 2019According to news originating from Cordoba, Spain, esearch stated, “Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) shortening is a biomarker of cellular aging that can be decelerated by diet. 

- We aimed to investigate the effect of dietary intake of vitamin E on biomarkers of cellular senescence in patients with established cardiovascular disease.” DNA from 1,002 participants was isolated and Leukocyte telomere length was measured by real-time PCR. 

- Furthermore, we observed higher glutathione peroxidase activity in subjects consuming less vitamin E (p=.031).” According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Our findings support the importance of an adequate consumption of the antioxidant vitamin E, and the value of the diet as a modulating tool of the senescence process.”(NEXT)N-acetylcysteine Prevents Osteoporosis By Inhibiting Oxidative Stress Caused by Testosterone Deficiency Nanjing Medical University (China), August 21, 2019According to news reporting from Nanjing, People’s Republic of China, research stated, “Oxidative stress is associated with many diseases and has been found to induce DNA damage and cellular senescence. 

- Numerous evidences support the detrimental effects of oxidative stress or cellular senescence on skeletal homeostasis.” According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “The results from this study suggest that NAC could be considered as a potential therapeutic agent for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis caused by testosterone deficiency.”(NEXT)Lifelong study links early blood pressure change to poorer brain health University College London, August 20, 2019Changes in blood pressure in those as young as 36 are linked to markers of poorer brain health in later life, finds UCL-led research involving participants of Britain's oldest running birth cohort study. 

- Quackwatch’s Conspiratorial Theory Against Alternative MedicineRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, August 15, 2019A trend that is increasingly becoming accepted in mainstream, conventional medicine has been the acceptance of complementary and alternative medical theories and practices. 

- Portending to be a consumer protection resource, the organization believes it is serving public health. 

- For those who are exceptionally critical of Skepticism’s radical reductionist view of medicine and health, it has become evident that this loose confederacy of groups—Quackwatch, Science Based Medicine, Skeptic organizations, and Wikipedia—have sacrificed objectivity for groupthink.For several decades, the website Quackwatch, founded by former psychiatrist Dr. Stephen Barrett, has been a one-stop shopping center for negative critiques and reviews about practically every kind of medical therapy and practice that falls under the umbrella of alternative medicine. 

- It has been memorialized by Skeptics who have in turn infected many of Wikipedia’s entries with Quackwatch references under the false pretense that it is a scientifically reliable resource.To be fair, not all of Quackwatch’s criticisms are unwarranted; there are certainly charlatans and entrepreneurs practicing in both conventional and alternative medical camps. 

- And pharmaceutical executives notoriously fool federal health officials with only partial or fake science to get ineffective and toxic drugs through hurdles at the FDA. 

- This not only concerns his limited knowledge and highly biased analysis of the scientific literature supporting many common alternative medical practices and natural nutritional protocols, but also many commercial products Americans use or are exposed to on a daily basis.In his book Chemical Sensitivity: The Truth About Environmental Illness, Barrett states that we live in a time “when our food supply is the world’s safest and our antipollution program is the best we have ever had.” He argues that those who fear chemical- and food-related sensitivities, or who believe they are being poisoned by cosmetic ingredients, pesticides, household cleaning and petrochemical products, fast foods and the average American meat-based diet, food preservatives, fluoride, mercury amalgams, and other environmental toxic substances, are simply delusional. 

- Barely a day goes by without a new study appearing in the scientific literature about a recently discovered health risk regarding any one of these issues.The question we ask ourselves is why, and perhaps how, can Barrett categorically deny the enormous body of peer-reviewed scientific evidence that confirms Americans are living in an unhealthy toxic environment every day in their lives? 

- The World Health Organization has released dire warnings regarding this trend and estimated that 1 in 4 global deaths are due to air, water, soil pollution and chemical exposure. 

- Barrett’s role as a Board member of Scientific Advisers to the American Committee on Health Science (ACHS) for almost 4 decades however provides a strong case for his strong biases that would explain his favoritism towards many drugs and commercial products that have been proven to carry high health risks.ACHS is a corporate-funded consumer advocacy organization that makes the false claim that it supports evidence-based medicine. 

- It has also received funding to lobby on behalf Pepsi, Monsanto, Exxon-Mobil and British American Tobacco as well as receiving funds from the Koch family and major forces within the Randian pro-industry American Legislative Exchange Council.Finally, it should be noted that the watchdog organization Center for Science in the Public Interest issued a report concluding that ACHS promotes fraudulent science to whitewash the health risks of some our most dangerous commercial products. 

- Therefore, why should anyone believe his assessment of alternative health is scientifically plausible?This may explain why Barrett has had a career that has been largely out of touch with America’s declining health trends now that iatrogenic or medical-based error is the third leading cause of mortality in the US. 

- However, this does not explain why Quackwatch is obsessively determined to undermine complementary, alternative, non-conventional medical therapies. 

- While the site pretends to be protecting public health by attempting to discredit effective, cost-saving health practices, we observe that it is serving the economic interests of the pharmaceutical industry. 

- By discrediting every alternative medical therapy or supplemental nutrient or botanical medicine a patient may seek out for relief or treatment for a health condition or disease, Quackwatch in effect diverts their queries back into our broken drug-based medical system as the only recourse of treatment available.In an ingenious way, Barrett has created a perfect distraction. 

- And this has contaminated the entire Skeptic movement and Jimmy Wales and Wikipedia have drunk deep from the gully of this conspiratorial Kool aid.We must realize that the vast majority of people seeking relief for any disease will begin with conventional medicine. 

- So where is the study that enables Quackwatch and Skeptics to confirm that these patients have not benefitted from alternative approaches?Over the years we have interviewed hundreds of board-certified physicians who only started to explore complementary and alternative medical modalities after their orthodox approaches to treat patients were found limited. 

- In the case of California and New York, some early physicians in the 1960s and 1970s were brought up on charges of fraud: the fraud being that they were not using accepted medical protocols at that time, despite their clinical experience that their patients benefitted. 

- Today physicians are permitted to practice with informed consent without the fear of being harassed or the loss of their medical license. 

- One example is the second largest medical group, the Chiropractors. 

- The same is true for acupuncture, homeopathy, naturopathy and other approaches to natural health. 

- Therefore, the scientific literature has kept pace with consumer interest and these alternative medical therapies.

- Medical Skepticism:  Today’s Scientific Cultural DiseaseRichard Gale and Gary Null PhDProgressive Radio Network, August 5, 2019Modern day Skepticism is one of those annoying contagions that won't go away. 

- Therefore, we have no reservations in stating that the extreme scientific reductionism represented by Skepticism, especially biological and medical skepticism, is a serious threat to medical innovation, scientific discovery and in the long term public health. 

- And to their credit, SBM’s foremost spokespersons Steven Novella and David Gorski opening criticize EBM’s shortcomings, including the now epidemic of erroneous research being published in medical journals, the increasing trends in professional bias in order to reach positive results, and journals' financial incentives to publish junk studies. 

- However, considering EBM's flaws and failures, SBM perceives itself as the next great leap for modern medicine in order to establish scientific consensus on medical discovery and therapeutic practices by including the plausibility principle. 

- Repeatedly, without any sound understanding for why a certain alternative health therapy either succeeds or fails, Skeptics invoke plausibility as the only necessary criteria to discard outright non-conventional practices and therefore to advocate against funding research to investigate any promises they may hold. 

- And Skeptics are easily outraged whenever accused of entertaining subjective biases that taint their evaluation of medical therapies outside their cherishing-held belief system. 

- Whenever Skeptics are confronted with a scientific or medical narrative that is contrary to their own subjective biases, and in the absence of a scientifically valid argument based upon strong evidence to support Skepticism's counter-narrative, the Skeptic mind simply fills in the blank with the “plausibility” argument. 

- The curse of false beliefs as contingent upon the plausibility argument goes to the heart of the "science wars" between Skeptical materialist views of medical science and advocates of non-conventional medical practices, including nutrition, naturopathy, Chinese and Ayurveda medicine, etc., whose world view is less narrowly linear and more akin to modern systems theory and the physics of cause and effect. 

- When understood in this manner, SBM can be viewed as a kind of skeptical medical imperialism, an excess of science that muddles its own subjective and biased values with being scientifically factual. 

- Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist; Sam Harris is a neuroscientist; Jerry Coyne and PZ Meyer are biologists; Daniel Dennett and Steven Pinker are cognitive scientists and philosophers; Paul Offit, Ben Goldacre, Stephen Barrett and most of the active members of the SBM cult are practicing medical physicians. 

- We can review a case of applying the Skeptics own “plausibility” criteria to a medical legal decision that they have fervently disapproved of.
